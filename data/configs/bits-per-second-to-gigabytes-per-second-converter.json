    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a data rate expressed in bits per second (bit/s) into gigabytes per second (GB/s) using SI (decimal) conventions by default. It clarifies the difference between decimal gigabytes (GB = 10^9 bytes) and binary gibibytes (GiB = 2^30 bytes) because both conventions are commonly encountered in networking and storage.",
      "Use the tool for quick conversions when sizing links, estimating transfer times, or comparing advertised network speeds to observed throughput. For high-accuracy capacity planning, consider protocol overhead, encoding schemes, and whether reported values are 'bits on the wire' (physical layer) or 'goodput' (usable payload)."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base relationship: 1 byte = 8 bits. Converting bits per second to bytes per second requires dividing by 8. The choice of gigabyte unit changes the divisor: decimal GB uses 10^9, binary GiB uses 2^30.",
      "Decimal (SI) convention — recommended for most networking equipment and marketing specifications: GB/s = bps ÷ (8 × 10^9). Binary (IEC) convention — used by some operating systems and storage contexts: GiB/s = bps ÷ (8 × 2^30).",
      "When estimating real transfer time, subtract protocol overhead (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP headers, and any lower-layer encoding) because 'link rate' (line rate) differs from application-level throughput."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal gigabytes per second (GB/s): GB/s = bps ÷ (8 × 10^9). Example: 1 000 000 000 bit/s → 1 000 000 000 ÷ 8 000 000 000 = 0.125 GB/s.",
      "Binary gibibytes per second (GiB/s): GiB/s = bps ÷ (8 × 2^30). Example: 1 000 000 000 bit/s → 1 000 000 000 ÷ 8 589 934 592 ≈ 0.1164 GiB/s.",
      "To convert back to bits per second: bps = GB/s × 8 × (10^9) for decimal GB, or bps = GiB/s × 8 × (2^30) for binary GiB."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 000 000 000 bit/s (1 Gbit/s) = 0.125 GB/s (decimal) ≈ 0.1164 GiB/s (binary).",
      "10 000 000 000 bit/s (10 Gbit/s) = 1.25 GB/s (decimal) ≈ 1.164 GiB/s (binary).",
      "100 000 000 bit/s (100 Mbit/s) = 0.0125 GB/s (decimal) ≈ 0.01164 GiB/s (binary)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact mathematical relationship used?",
        "answer": "We use 1 byte = 8 bits. For decimal gigabytes: GB/s = bps ÷ (8 × 10^9). For binary gibibytes: GiB/s = bps ÷ (8 × 2^30)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which convention should I use: GB (decimal) or GiB (binary)?",
        "answer": "Use decimal GB (10^9 bytes) for networking and vendor-rated link speeds because most network specifications use SI prefixes. Use GiB (2^30 bytes) when working with OS-level storage reports or software that explicitly uses binary prefixes. Always check the context and label."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will this conversion reflect real transfer speeds I observe?",
        "answer": "No—this is a raw unit conversion. Real transfer speeds (goodput) are lower due to protocol headers, inter-frame gaps, encryption, retransmissions, and link-layer encoding. Subtract estimated overhead to approximate application-level throughput."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "For planning, round conservatively: present results to three significant digits for high rates (e.g., 1.25 GB/s) and keep extra precision for calculations. When comparing to measured device telemetry, align units exactly (GB vs GiB) before rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there authoritative references for these conventions?",
        "answer": "Yes. SI prefixes and the difference between decimal and binary prefixes are documented by national metrology institutes and international bodies. Refer to standards from NIST and BIPM for authoritative guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for physical-layer encoding (e.g., 64b/66b or 8b/10b)?",
        "answer": "No. Encoding schemes change the effective payload fraction; for example, 8b/10b adds 25% overhead. To get effective application throughput, multiply the line rate by the payload fraction after converting units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert from bits per second to seconds per gigabyte (transfer time)?",
        "answer": "Compute GB = bytes per gigabyte (decimal: 10^9 bytes) then seconds = (GB × 8 × 10^9) ÷ bps. Equivalently, seconds per GB = (8 × 10^9) ÷ bps for decimal GB; use 8 × 2^30 for binary GiB."
