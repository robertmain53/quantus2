    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts United States dollars (USD) to Ethereum (ETH) using an aggregated live spot price. It provides an indicative rate for planning and comparison; it is not an executable exchange order or settlement quote.",
      "Cryptocurrency prices move continuously. The displayed conversion reflects the momentary mid-market price from aggregated data feeds and is rounded for display. For trading, transfers, or tax reporting use official transaction receipts and check your executing venue for final amounts and fees."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter computes ETH = USD ÷ SpotPriceUSDperETH. SpotPriceUSDperETH is derived from an aggregated market feed that prioritizes liquid venues and time-weighted observations to reduce single-source anomalies.",
      "Displayed results include a timestamp for the price sample in ISO 8601 (UTC). Values are presented with sufficient decimal precision for clarity (ETH balances commonly display up to 8–18 decimals depending on UI). The tool intentionally omits custody, exchange, and blockchain network fees; include those separately when executing transactions.",
      "To ensure accurate timekeeping of price samples the system aligns timestamps to authoritative time servers. For best practices on time sources and timestamping see NIST time services and ISO timekeeping guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: ETH = USD ÷ SpotPriceUSDperETH.",
      "Inverse formula (ETH → USD): USD = ETH × SpotPriceUSDperETH.",
      "SpotPriceUSDperETH is an aggregated mid-market price computed from multiple liquidity sources and excludes venue-specific fees. The platform records the sample timestamp and the number of liquidity sources used.",
      "Rounding and display: final ETH is rounded for display to a sensible number of decimals; internal calculations use higher precision to avoid rounding drift."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this the exact amount I'll receive when I buy ETH?",
        "answer": "No. This converter shows an indicative mid-market value only. Executed trades will differ because exchanges add spreads, order book slippage, and may charge trading and withdrawal fees. Wallet transfers also incur blockchain gas fees. Always check your executing venue for the final settlement amount."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often is the rate updated?",
        "answer": "Rates update continuously as new market data arrives. The page shows the sample timestamp (UTC) for the last price used. For ultra-low-latency needs, rely on a direct market data feed or exchange API rather than a browser tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool include taxes or regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "No. Tax treatment depends on jurisdiction and transaction type. In the United States, virtual currency guidance from the Internal Revenue Service applies; consult the IRS and a tax professional for obligations and recordkeeping. See official guidance for details."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might the displayed conversion differ from another service?",
        "answer": "Differences arise from data sources, aggregation methods, update frequency, and whether the service includes fees or uses bid/ask prices. This tool uses an aggregated mid-market approach and intentionally excludes trading fees and slippage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are ETH amounts?",
        "answer": "Ethereum balances can be represented with high precision (many clients use up to 18 decimal places). For human-readable output this tool displays a truncated, readable number while keeping higher precision internally. Use exchange or wallet APIs for settlement-level precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there minimums or limits?",
        "answer": "This converter imposes no minimums because it is a calculation-only tool. Actual trading or on-ramp services may impose minimum purchase sizes, KYC requirements, or limits—check the executing provider."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion legally binding?",
        "answer": "No. The result is informational. A legally binding exchange or transfer requires execution through an exchange, broker, or custodial service and is subject to their terms, fees, and regulatory compliance checks."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I record transactions for tax or audit?",
        "answer": "Record the executed transaction details from your exchange or wallet (timestamp, amount, transaction IDs, fees). For United States guidance on virtual currency tax treatment refer to official IRS resources and consult a qualified tax professional."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about security and privacy?",
        "answer": "This conversion tool performs calculations in-browser or via a read-only price feed and does not require account credentials. When moving funds, use secure wallets, enable recommended protections (hardware or multi-factor authentication), and review guidance from recognized security standards and regulators."
