    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes) from detailed operating inputs or by reconciling from Net Income. Use the operating-item inputs for a line-item build-up, or provide Net Income, interest, and tax to reconcile to EBIT.",
      "The tool returns: (1) EBIT derived from operating components, (2) EBIT reconciled from Net Income, and (3) EBIT Margin as a percentage. Values are numerical and intended for analysis, planning, or reporting support; confirm with official accounting records and financial statements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary calculation: EBIT is computed as operating income before financing and tax items. We accept both a component-based build (Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses − Depreciation & Amortization) and a reconciliation from the income statement (Net Income + Interest Expense + Tax Expense).",
      "Quality, traceability, and handling guidance align with industry best practices for numerical tools and data protection. For software and data handling, follow NIST recommendations for integrity and accuracy controls, ISO quality-management principles for validation and versioning, IEEE guidance for numerical correctness in computing components, and OSHA guidance where workplace financial controls intersect with safety/compliance processes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Component method: EBIT = Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses − Depreciation & Amortization",
      "Reconciliation method: EBIT = Net Income + Interest Expense + Tax Expense",
      "EBIT Margin (%) = (EBIT / Revenue) × 100. If Revenue = 0, the calculator returns 0% and flags the result as undefined for ratio analysis; review inputs when revenue is zero or negative."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 (component): Revenue 500,000; COGS 200,000; Operating Expenses 150,000; Depreciation 20,000 → EBIT = 500,000 − 200,000 − 150,000 − 20,000 = 130,000; EBIT Margin = 26.0%",
      "Example 2 (reconciliation): Net Income 80,000; Interest Expense 10,000; Tax Expense 20,000 → Reconciled EBIT = 80,000 + 10,000 + 20,000 = 110,000"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which inputs should I use: component method or reconciliation from Net Income?",
        "answer": "Use the component method when you have detailed operating line items; use reconciliation when only the bottom-line (Net Income) and financing/tax amounts are available. Both should produce similar results if the input sets are complete and consistent with the same accounting basis (GAAP or IFRS)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do the two EBIT values differ?",
        "answer": "Differences usually result from mismatched scopes: operating expenses definitions, whether depreciation is included in operating expenses, one-time items, or non-operating gains/losses. Reconcile line items on the financial statements and ensure consistent classification before comparing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results and what are the limitations?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic is exact to the inputs provided. Accuracy depends on input quality, accounting policies (e.g., IFRS vs US GAAP), and whether non-recurring items are excluded. This tool follows best-practice validation guidance but is not a substitute for audited financial statements. Users should apply rounding consistent with financial reporting and maintain an audit trail per ISO quality and NIST data integrity recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you handle zero or negative revenue when computing EBIT margin?",
        "answer": "If Revenue equals zero, EBIT Margin is not meaningful. The formula avoids division-by-zero by returning a 0% presentation and flags that ratio analysis is undefined; treat such results as indicators to review inputs rather than definitive ratios."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool guarantee compliance with accounting standards?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides calculations and guidance. Compliance with accounting standards (IFRS, US GAAP, local statutory rules) depends on how line items are classified and disclosed. Consult a qualified accountant or auditor for regulatory compliance and formal reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What practices should I follow for reliable results?",
        "answer": "Maintain consistent accounting policies, use period-consistent line items, document rounding and data sources, and implement version control for inputs. Follow ISO quality-management and NIST data-integrity controls for reliable, auditable calculations."
