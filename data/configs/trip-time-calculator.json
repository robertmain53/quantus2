            "Estimate door-to-door driving time by pairing your route distance with a realistic average speed and explicit delay minutes for stops, fueling, meals, and recurring congestion.",
            "Designed for drivers, fleet planners, and dispatchers who need transparent, physics-based time estimates in hours and minutes rather than optimistic best cases."
        ],
        "methodology": [
            "Core kinematics applies time = distance ÷ average speed; keep distance and speed in the same unit system (miles with mph or kilometers with km/h) for valid hours output.",
            "Base driving time excludes interruptions; planned delays are converted from minutes to hours and summed to yield a more realistic total trip time.",

                "question": "What average speed should I enter?",
                "answer": "Use the speed you realistically sustain on the route, not the posted limit. Urban corridors, work zones, weather, or heavy vehicles justify lower averages than free-flow interstates."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do I account for traffic or checkpoints?",
                "answer": "Add those minutes into planned delays. Include recurring congestion, toll or border queues, refueling, meals, and rest breaks to align with planning-time reliability."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does this handle unit conversions automatically?",
                "answer": "No. Keep distance and average speed in the same system—miles with mph or kilometers with km/h—so the hours output remains correct."
            },
            {
                "question": "Why include rest breaks?",
                "answer": "Safety research links long uninterrupted driving and fatigue to higher crash risk. Scheduling short breaks helps maintain alertness and compliance with duty-hour guidance."
