    "introduction": [
      "This amortization calculator compares common bi‑weekly approaches and shows estimated payments, total amount paid and estimated interest over the nominal schedule. It supports a direct bi‑weekly compounding method and the accelerated (half monthly) method so you can compare outcomes side‑by‑side.",
      "Results are computed from standard annuity formulas; where exact payoff timing depends on iteration and remaining principal, the tool reports nominal schedule estimates and includes caveats about rounding and day‑count conventions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Direct bi‑weekly method uses an interest period of 1/26 of the annual rate and computes payments for term_years * 26 periods. This directly models lenders that compound on bi‑weekly cycles.",
      "Accelerated bi‑weekly method first computes the monthly annuity payment then uses half that amount every two weeks. Because there are 26 bi‑weekly payments per year this typically yields an effective extra monthly payment per year and accelerates payoff.",
      "Both methods allow an extra fixed contribution per bi‑weekly payment. The calculator uses closed‑form annuity formulas for nominal schedules; it does not perform a full per‑payment amortization loop in the browser for exact payoff dates when extra payments shorten the loan — see accuracy notes below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Monthly annuity payment M = P * r_month / (1 - (1 + r_month) ** (-n_months)), where r_month = APR/100/12 and n_months = term_years * 12.",
      "Direct bi‑weekly payment (closed form) uses r_bi = APR/100/26 and n_bi = term_years * 26, payment = P * r_bi / (1 - (1 + r_bi) ** (-n_bi)).",
      "Accelerated bi‑weekly payment (common approach) = (monthly_payment / 2) + extra_payment_each_payment. Totals are computed as payment * n_bi for nominal comparisons."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this give exact payoff date when I add extra payments?",
        "answer": "No. Outputs use nominal payment counts (term_years * 26) and closed‑form sums for comparability. Adding extra payments reduces principal faster in reality; an exact payoff date requires a per‑payment iterative amortization schedule which depends on lender day‑count and payment application rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method saves more interest?",
        "answer": "Generally the direct bi‑weekly compounding and accelerated (half monthly) approaches both reduce interest versus monthly payments because you make more frequent payments; exact savings depend on rate, term and extra payments. Use the two modes here to compare nominal totals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these numbers?",
        "answer": "This tool uses standard annuity formulas and reports nominal schedule totals. Differences may arise from lender rounding, day‑count conventions, exact interest application dates, escrow, fees, and prepayment rules. Treat results as estimates; for loan payoff planning get an itemized amortization schedule from your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards guide the calculator's reliability and data handling?",
        "answer": "Computation and software quality practices align with general standards such as NIST guidance on numeric algorithms and verification, ISO software quality best practices, and IEEE recommendations for numerical accuracy. For data handling and workplace safety references, consult relevant OSHA and organizational policies."
