    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms angle measurements from degrees (familiar units) to radians (SI scientific unit), enabling precise calculations in physics, mathematics, and engineering. It is designed for scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and students.",
      "Degrees are intuitive (360° = full circle), while radians are mathematically fundamental (2π = full circle). Most programming languages and scientific calculations use radians. Understanding this conversion is essential for scientific work.",
      "This converter uses the precise relationship where 180° equals exactly π radians, enabling accurate angle conversions for trigonometric calculations, physics simulations, and rotational motion analysis."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The relationship between degrees and radians: 180° = π radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180 = 0.0174533. For example, 90° = π/2 ≈ 1.5708 rad, 45° = π/4 ≈ 0.7854 rad.",
      "Common angles: 0° = 0 rad, 30° = π/6 rad, 45° = π/4 rad, 60° = π/3 rad, 90° = π/2 rad, 180° = π rad, 360° = 2π rad. Memorizing these common values is helpful.",
      "Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in programming languages expect radians, not degrees. Converting angles before trig calculations prevents errors.",
      "This converter provides precise angle conversions for physics simulations, mathematical calculations, engineering analysis, and programming applications requiring trigonometric functions."

    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Common angles: 45° (π/4 = 0.7854 rad) appears in geometry and physics.",
      "Example 2 – Right angle: 90° = π/2 ≈ 1.5708 rad, fundamental in geometry.",
      "Example 3 – Full rotation: 360° = 2π ≈ 6.2832 rad, representing complete circular motion.",
      "Example 4 – Small angles: 1° ≈ 0.01745 rad, important in precise optical and mechanical applications."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from degrees to radians?",
        "answer": "Multiply degrees by π/180 to get radians. π/180 ≈ 0.0174533 rad/degree."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use radians in science?",
        "answer": "Radians are dimensionless and appear naturally in calculus, making mathematical analysis simpler. Most scientific software uses radians by default."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the radian?",
        "answer": "One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc length equal to the radius. This natural definition makes radians fundamental to circular mathematics."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use trigonometric functions?",
        "answer": "In programming (Python, C, JavaScript), sin(), cos(), tan() expect radians. Convert degrees to radians first using this converter, then call trig functions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is angular velocity?",
        "answer": "Rate of angle change over time, measured in rad/s. For circular motion, v = ω×r where ω is angular velocity in rad/s."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are radians used in calculus?",
        "answer": "Derivatives of trig functions (d/dx[sin(x)]) assume x is in radians. Using degrees in calculus produces incorrect results."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the relationship between arc length and angle?",
        "answer": "Arc length = radius × angle(in radians). This fundamental relationship motivates radian definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are angles measured in navigation?",
        "answer": "Navigation uses compass bearings in degrees (0-360). Converting to radians enables programmatic navigation calculations using vector math."
