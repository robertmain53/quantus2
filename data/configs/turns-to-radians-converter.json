    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts angular values expressed in gradians (also called grads or gon) into radians using the exact mathematical relationship adopted by metric-based systems. Gradians subdivide a right angle into 100 gradians; a full circle is 400 gradians.",
      "Use this tool when you need a precise, SI-consistent conversion for engineering, surveying, lab calculations, or documentation. Results are provided with sufficient precision for most technical uses; see the methodology and FAQ for guidance on instrument resolution and calibration."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion stems from the circular relationships: a full circle equals 400 gradians and 2π radians. Therefore one gradian equals π/200 radians. This relationship is exact and independent of measurement device.",
      "When converting, multiply the gradians value by π/200 to obtain radians. For reversed conversion, multiply radians by 200/π to get gradians. Use a value of π consistent with your numerical precision requirements (for most practical work use at least double precision).",
      "For traceable measurement and compliance in regulated workflows, follow calibration and uncertainty practices recommended by standards bodies and national labs. Check equipment specifications for resolution (smallest readable unit) and apply rounding only after considering measurement uncertainty."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula (gradians → radians): radians = gradians × π / 200",
      "Inverse (radians → gradians): gradians = radians × 200 / π"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 gradians → radians: 100 × π / 200 = π / 2 ≈ 1.570796326794897 radians",
      "1 gradian → radians: 1 × π / 200 ≈ 0.015707963267949 radians",
      "250 gradians → radians: 250 × π / 200 = (5π / 4) ≈ 3.926990716"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between gradians and radians?",
        "answer": "One gradian equals π/200 radians. This is an exact mathematical relationship derived from the fact that 400 gradians = 2π radians (full circle)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use for engineering work?",
        "answer": "Use precision that matches your measurement uncertainty and downstream calculations. For typical engineering tasks double-precision (15+ significant digits) is more than enough; for printed reports 6–9 significant digits usually suffice. Do not overstate precision beyond the instrument's resolution and calibrated uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "My theodolite/total station reads in gradians; how does instrument resolution affect conversion?",
        "answer": "Instrument resolution (smallest step) sets the practical limit on meaningful digits. Convert the raw reading, then round to reflect instrument resolution and calibration uncertainty. For regulatory or contract work, preserve traceability by documenting the instrument, its resolution, and calibration status."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are gradians commonly used and where will I encounter them?",
        "answer": "Gradians are used in surveying and civil engineering in some countries and legacy workflows. They were introduced as part of metrication efforts to simplify right-angle subdivisions. Verify project standards or client requirements before publishing results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to perform calibration before using converted values in safety- or code-critical work?",
        "answer": "Yes. For safety-critical, legal, or regulated outcomes, ensure measuring instruments are calibrated to traceable standards and that uncertainty budgets are documented. National metrology institutes publish calibration services and guidance for angular measurements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references for this conversion and measurement practice?",
        "answer": "Standards bodies and national labs provide authoritative definitions and guidance on units and calibration. Consult the SI Brochure and your national metrology institute for formal references and calibration services."
