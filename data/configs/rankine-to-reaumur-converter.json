    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a temperature value on the Rankine scale (absolute scale based on Fahrenheit degrees) into the Réaumur scale (an older centigrade-related scale where 0°Ré is freezing and 80°Ré is boiling of water at standard pressure). Use this for historical data, conversions in legacy engineering texts, or academic work.",
      "Results are computed using an exact fixed relationship between the scales via Kelvin/Celsius intermediates. For traceable measurement work, follow calibration and uncertainty guidance below and consult the cited standards for recommended procedures and reporting.",
      "Values are returned as exact mathematical results; for reporting, round to the precision appropriate for your measurement context and record estimates of uncertainty if the input originates from instruments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed by translating Rankine to Kelvin (or Celsius) then converting Celsius to Réaumur. This preserves the fixed ratios between degree sizes and absolute-zero offsets.",
      "We present both the stepwise method and the consolidated linear formula. The method aligns with SI referencing practices and traceability recommendations from measurement authorities.",
      "For measurement-grade work, apply instrument calibration data and include uncertainty budgets following guidance from NIST and ISO metrology standards cited below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Stepwise method: 1) Convert Rankine to Kelvin: K = R × 5/9. 2) Convert Kelvin to Celsius: C = K − 273.15. 3) Convert Celsius to Réaumur: Re = C × 0.8.",
      "Compact linear formula: °Ré = (4/9) × °R − 218.52. This comes from combining the intermediate steps and constants exactly.",
      "Example arithmetic check: for boiling water at standard pressure, °R = 671.67. Using the formula: °Ré = (4/9)*671.67 − 218.52 = 80.00."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 671.67 °R (steam at water boiling point, standard pressure): °Ré = (4/9)*671.67 − 218.52 = 80.00 °Ré.",
      "Convert 0 °R (absolute zero): °Ré = (4/9)*0 − 218.52 = −218.52 °Ré, which corresponds to −273.15 °C.",
      "Convert 491.67 °R (equivalent to 32 °F, freezing point of water): °Ré = (4/9)*491.67 − 218.52 = 0.00 °Ré."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What symbols are used for these scales?",
        "answer": "Rankine is commonly denoted °R or °Ra. Réaumur is denoted °Ré or °Re. Be explicit when reporting to avoid symbol confusion with other scale abbreviations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the converter and how should I round results?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact for real-number arithmetic. Round to a number of decimal places that matches the input measurement precision or instrument uncertainty. For laboratory reporting, follow significant-figure rules and include uncertainty estimates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits or common pitfalls?",
        "answer": "Réaumur is a historical scale and rarely used for modern instrumentation. Watch for mislabelled degrees (e.g., confusing °R with °Ré). Also note that Réaumur is most meaningful near typical laboratory temperatures; for extreme values, document physical relevance and instrument calibration status."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate instruments before using these conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. For any measurement used as input, ensure the thermometer or sensor has current calibration traceable to national standards. Follow calibration intervals and uncertainty estimation methods recommended by NIST and ISO metrology guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report uncertainty after conversion?",
        "answer": "Propagate input measurement uncertainty through the linear conversion formula. For a conversion y = a*x + b, the absolute uncertainty is |a| times the input uncertainty. Document the method used for propagation and reference standards used for calibration and uncertainty evaluation."
