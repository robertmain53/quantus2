    "introduction": [
      "This calculator converts nominal investment returns into inflation-adjusted (real) returns and computes nominal and inflation-adjusted future values given a starting principal and time horizon. Use it to understand purchasing-power outcomes rather than nominal figures alone.",
      "The tool uses a compound model: nominal growth compounded at the nominal rate, discounting by compounded inflation to present results in constant purchasing power. It reports both annualized real rate and cumulative real return over the period."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Real (inflation-adjusted) annual return is computed using the Fisher relationship: (1 + nominal) / (1 + inflation) - 1. This converts nominal growth to growth in constant purchasing power.",
      "Future values use discrete annual compounding. Nominal future value = principal × (1 + nominal_return)^years. Inflation-adjusted future value divides the nominal future value by (1 + inflation_rate)^years.",
      "Data integrity and numerical stability practices are followed: inputs are validated for sensible ranges, and calculations avoid subtractive cancellation in intermediate steps where possible. Implementation guidance references NIST and IEEE best practices for numerical computation and data handling to reduce rounding and representation errors."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Real annual return (%) = ((1 + nominal_return/100) / (1 + inflation_rate/100) - 1) × 100",
      "Nominal future value = principal × (1 + nominal_return/100) ^ years",
      "Inflation-adjusted future value = nominal future value / (1 + inflation_rate/100) ^ years",
      "Real cumulative return (%) = (((1 + nominal_return/100) / (1 + inflation_rate/100)) ^ years - 1) × 100"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $10,000 invested for 10 years at a 6% nominal return and 2% inflation. Nominal future ≈ 10,000 × 1.06^10. Inflation-adjusted future ≈ nominal future / 1.02^10. Annual real return ≈ ((1.06/1.02)-1) × 100 ≈ 3.92%."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use the nominal return to model growth, and the inflation rate to convert that growth into constant purchasing power. Results are estimates using annual compounding and a single inflation rate; they do not account for taxes, fees, irregular contributions, or variable inflation."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between nominal and real return?",
        "answer": "Nominal return is the percentage change in money value without adjusting for inflation. Real return adjusts nominal return for inflation to show change in purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these results?",
        "answer": "This calculator provides estimates based on annual compounding and a constant inflation rate. Accuracy depends on input quality and assumptions. For production deployments, follow NIST guidance for data validation and IEEE recommendations for floating-point computations to reduce numeric error. Results are not guaranteed and should be cross-checked for high-stakes decisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which inflation rate should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a long-term expected inflation rate that matches the horizon of your investment. Public indexes (for example, CPI) are commonly used for historical comparisons. For projections, consider scenario analysis with multiple inflation rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I include taxes, fees, or irregular cash flows?",
        "answer": "This simplified tool does not model taxes, fees, or cash flow timing. For detailed planning including contributions or withdrawals, use a dedicated cash-flow or retirement planner that supports multiple cash flows and tax rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits on the inputs?",
        "answer": "Inputs are constrained to reasonable ranges to avoid nonsensical results. Extremely large rates or very long horizons may amplify numeric rounding; exercise care and verify results with alternative methods for extreme cases."
