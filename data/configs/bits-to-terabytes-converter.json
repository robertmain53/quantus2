Backup needs vary."},{"question":"What's the largest drive?","answer":"Commercial: 24 TB. Enterprise can exceed 100 TB with arrays."},{"question":"Are TB and TiB different?","answer":"Yes. TB = 10^12 bytes. TiB = 1024^4 bytes. Most use TB."},{"question":"How fast is terabyte transfer?","answer":"At 100 Mbps: 23 hours.
