    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts volume values from milliliters (mL) to cubic meters (m³). A milliliter is a metric unit equal to one cubic centimeter; a cubic meter is the SI coherent unit for volume. The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship: 1 mL = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m³.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversions in laboratory notes, engineering calculations, procurement, and reporting. For regulatory or safety-critical work, follow traceable measurement practices and document calibration and uncertainty as described in standards from national metrology institutes and relevant international bodies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses exact SI-based equivalence between the units: 1 milliliter equals 1 cubic centimeter and 1 cubic centimeter equals 1×10⁻⁶ cubic meters. This is a dimensionally consistent, fixed multiplier and does not require empirical inputs.",
      "Recommended practice: present results with appropriate significant figures based on the precision of the original measurement instrument. For laboratory measurements, include instrument calibration reference and an uncertainty estimate in reports. For industrial or safety use, follow applicable standards for measurement traceability and reporting."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: value_in_m3 = value_in_mL × 1e-6.",
      "Step example: 250 mL × 1e-6 = 0.00025 m³.",
      "Inverse conversion: value_in_mL = value_in_m3 × 1e6."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 500 mL to cubic meters: 500 × 1e-6 = 0.0005 m³.",
      "Convert 1 mL to cubic meters: 1 × 1e-6 = 0.000001 m³ (one microcubic meter)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why multiply by 1×10⁻⁶?",
        "answer": "A milliliter is one cubic centimeter and a cubic meter is 1,000,000 cubic centimeters, so each milliliter is one millionth of a cubic meter. The multiplier 1×10⁻⁶ is exact and based on the definitions of SI units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I use?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the precision of your measurement device. If a pipette reports 3 significant figures, report the converted value with 3 significant figures and include uncertainty if required by your workflow or regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to account for temperature or density?",
        "answer": "The unit conversion itself is temperature-independent. However, when converting measured volumes of fluids for mass/volume calculations or for custody transfer, account for thermal expansion, density changes, and measurement temperature following applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact, but regulatory reporting often requires traceable measurement records, calibration certificates, and stated measurement uncertainty. Follow relevant standards and your local regulatory guidance."
