    "introduction": [
      "This calculator helps you compare a conventional monthly amortizing schedule to common bi‑weekly options used in auto lending: (1) making half of the monthly payment every two weeks (26 payments/year) and (2) using a true bi‑weekly amortizing payment based on 26 periods per year. Results are estimates to support planning and lender conversations.",
      "The tool accepts vehicle price, down payment, trade‑in and fees to compute the financed amount, then shows payment figures, annual totals, and an approximate interest savings and payoff time when using bi‑weekly approaches."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "All computations use standard amortization math: periodic rate = APR / periods per year; payment = principal × r / (1 − (1 + r)^(−N)) where N is total number of periods. For the 'half‑monthly' bi‑weekly method we calculate the standard monthly payment then halve it and multiply by 26 to show annual cashflow and an approximate reduction in term based on extra annual principal.",
      "The 'bi‑weekly amortizing' method computes the exact periodic payment for 26 equal periods per year using the same amortization formula but with r = APR/26 and N = term_years × 26 so results reflect a true 26‑period schedule.",
      "Accuracy and reliability: calculations follow standard numeric formulas used in financial engineering and assume fixed rate, fixed payments and no prepayment other than the schedule modeled. Results may differ from lender disclosures due to rounding, day‑count conventions, compounding assumptions, early payment crediting policies, or additional fees."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Loan principal = vehicle price − down payment − trade‑in + fees.",
      "Monthly periodic rate r_monthly = APR / 100 / 12. Monthly payment = loan_principal × r_monthly / (1 − (1 + r_monthly)^(− term_years × 12)).",
      "Bi‑weekly (half‑monthly) payment = monthly payment ÷ 2. Annual paid with this method = bi‑weekly payment × 26. Approximate new term scales by ratio of annual paid amounts (an approximation to show typical time reduction).",
      "Bi‑weekly (exact amortizing) uses r_biweekly = APR / 100 / 26 and N = term_years × 26; payment = loan_principal × r_biweekly / (1 − (1 + r_biweekly)^(−N))."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "If a loan has a $30,000 vehicle price, $3,000 down payment, 5‑year term, and 6% APR: monthly payment computed by the monthly formula; half of that amount paid every two weeks (26 payments) results in one extra monthly payment per year and a shorter payoff period. The exact figures are produced by the two methods in results.",
      "For the same inputs using the 'bi‑weekly amortizing' method, the payment is recomputed for 26 periods/year and total interest is compared with the monthly schedule."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this calculator legally binding or a guaranteed loan quote?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides estimates for planning. Final loan terms, APR, payment schedule, rounding and payoff dates are set by lenders and will appear on official disclosure documents. Use this calculator to compare scenarios and prepare questions for lenders."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do bi‑weekly payments often reduce interest?",
        "answer": "Making payments more frequently or paying an extra amount each year reduces outstanding principal faster, lowering the total interest accrued. The 'half‑monthly' 26‑payment pattern effectively produces one additional monthly payment per year which accelerates principal reduction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the results exact?",
        "answer": "The 'bi‑weekly amortizing' method computes exact amortizing payments for a 26‑period year under the model assumptions. The 'half‑monthly' method produces a close practical approximation. Both may differ from lender calculations due to compounding conventions, rounding, payment‑posting timing, or optional fees."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I watch for in lender disclosures?",
        "answer": "Compare the disclosed APR, payment frequency, total finance charge, prepayment policy, and whether the lender posts payments on the day received or at month end. These factors change final totals and payoff dates."

Use the results to compare cashflow and approximate interest savings, then confirm all terms with the lending institution."
