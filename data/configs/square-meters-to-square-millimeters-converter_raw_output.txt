1. This is a converter because it converts between two area units with a fixed mathematical relationship, requires a single numeric input, and returns one output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for a converter, no canonical_url, robots, schema_org, open_graph, ui, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
