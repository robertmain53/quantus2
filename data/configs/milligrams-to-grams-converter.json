    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms mass measurements from Milligrams to Grams, enabling precise calculations in pharmacy, chemistry, and cooking.",
      "The Milligram is the standard unit for small quantities in medicine and chemistry, while the Gram is the practical unit for cooking and everyday measurements.",
      "This converter uses the exact relationship where 1,000 Milligrams equal precisely 1 Gram."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1,000 mg = 1 g. To convert milligrams to grams, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 mg = 1 g, 500 mg = 0.5 g, 250 mg = 0.25 g.",
      "Medication dosing uses milligrams for precision, but nutritional information uses grams. Converting between these units is essential for health tracking.",
      "Chemical formulas and pharmaceutical preparations require precise mass in milligrams, while bulk measurements use grams.",
      "This converter provides precise mass conversions for pharmaceutical, chemical, and culinary applications."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Medication: A 500 mg tablet converts to 0.5 g for nutritional tracking.",
      "Example 2 – Spice measurement: A recipe calling for 2,500 mg of salt converts to 2.5 g for practical measuring.",
      "Example 3 – Vitamin supplement: A 1,000 mg dose converts to 1 g for daily intake calculation."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Milligrams to Grams?",
        "answer": "1,000 mg = 1 g. Divide milligrams by 1,000 to get grams."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use milligrams for medications?",
        "answer": "Milligrams provide precise numbers for drug dosing. A typical pill might contain 500 mg rather than 0.5 g, which is clearer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert between mg and other units?",
        "answer": "1 kg = 1,000 g = 1,000,000 mg. Use this conversion for any mass unit."
