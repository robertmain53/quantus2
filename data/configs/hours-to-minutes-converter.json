    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a numeric value expressed in hours into the equivalent number of minutes using the fixed relationship between the units. It is intended for timekeeping, scheduling, payroll checks, and general-purpose unit conversion where an accurate minutes value is required.",
      "Conversions use the exact mathematical relationship 1 hour = 60 minutes (and therefore 1 hour = 3600 seconds). Results are presented with guidance on rounding and data formatting to support accurate time records and reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the International System of Units relationship between time units: hours and minutes are linked by a constant factor. This is a deterministic arithmetic conversion and does not require empirical calibration.",
      "When used for operational or regulatory recordkeeping (for example payroll or safety logs), follow applicable organizational and national guidance on rounding and reporting. Relevant standards and agencies include NIST for measurement traceability, ISO for unit definitions, IEEE for technical rounding/representation practices, and OSHA for timekeeping and recordkeeping expectations.",
      "Accuracy caveats: the mathematical conversion is exact in rational arithmetic, but practical implementations use floating-point arithmetic which can introduce tiny representation errors. The tool documents recommended rounding rules and limits for display and export to minimize downstream discrepancies."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply hours by 60 to obtain minutes: minutes = hours × 60.",
      "To convert decimal hours (hours with fractional portion), apply the same multiplication. Example: 1.75 hours → 1.75 × 60 = 105 minutes.",
      "To reverse the conversion (minutes to hours): hours = minutes ÷ 60.",
      "When presenting results for recordkeeping, round according to policy. Common options: round to nearest whole minute, round up to next minute, or round to nearest 0.1 minute depending on reporting rules."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes.",
      "0.5 hours = 0.5 × 60 = 30 minutes.",
      "1.333333 hours ≈ 1.333333 × 60 = 80 minutes.",
      "Convert decimal hours for timesheets: 7.25 hours × 60 = 435 minutes."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This is a fixed, exact unit conversion using the factor 60. Use policy-driven rounding for reporting or payroll.",
      "Be mindful of floating-point representation; apply a consistent rounding rule before exporting or submitting time values."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion from hours to minutes exact?",
        "answer": "Mathematically, yes: 1 hour equals exactly 60 minutes, so minutes = hours × 60. In software, small floating-point representation differences can occur; for definitive records, apply a clear rounding rule after conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert decimal hours (for example, 1.75) to minutes?",
        "answer": "Multiply the decimal hours by 60. Example: 1.75 hours × 60 = 105 minutes. If you must record whole minutes only, round according to your policy (nearest, up, or down)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which rounding method should I use for payroll or compliance?",
        "answer": "Follow your employer or regulator guidance. Typical practices include rounding to the nearest minute, rounding up to the next minute, or rounding to the nearest tenth of an hour. Document and apply the same method consistently to remain defensible in audits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert minutes back to hours with this relationship?",
        "answer": "Yes. Hours = minutes ÷ 60. Use the same rounding and formatting rules when converting back to avoid inconsistencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there practical input limits or validation recommendations?",
        "answer": "Accept non-negative numeric inputs for elapsed time. For durations crossing days, convert total hours (including multiples of 24). For extremely large values verify storage and display formats to avoid integer overflow in downstream systems."
