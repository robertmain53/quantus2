    "introduction": [
      "Debt yield is a simple, lender-focused metric defined as Net Operating Income divided by Loan Amount. It is expressed as a percentage and is used to assess the cash-flow buffer available to cover debt independent of property valuation.",
      "This tool computes current debt yield, expresses it in both percent and basis points, and estimates the maximum loan amount consistent with a user-specified target debt yield. Use conservative inputs and cross-check against other underwriting metrics such as DSCR and LTV."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary calculation: Debt Yield = Net Operating Income ÷ Loan Amount. The result is a decimal that is commonly presented as a percentage (multiply by 100). This calculator treats inputs as point-in-time values; it does not forecast NOI or change loan balances over time.",
      "Accuracy and validation guidance: round inputs to realistic precision (NOI usually to nearest 1,000; loan amounts to nearest 1,000). For financial control and auditability, maintain original source documents for NOI and loan terms. Follow organizational quality-management practices (for example ISO 9001) and numerical best practices (IEEE floating-point considerations) when integrating this calculator into automated workflows."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Debt Yield = Net Operating Income ÷ Loan Amount. Example: NOI 800,000 ÷ Loan 10,000,000 = 0.08 → 8%.",
      "Debt Yield (basis points) = Debt Yield × 10,000. Example: 0.08 × 10,000 = 800 bps.",
      "Maximum Loan for Target Debt Yield = Net Operating Income ÷ Target Debt Yield. Example: NOI 800,000 ÷ 0.09 = 8,888,888.89."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: NOI = 1,200,000; Loan = 15,000,000 → Debt Yield = 1,200,000 ÷ 15,000,000 = 0.08 (8%), 800 bps.",
      "Example 2: NOI = 600,000; target debt yield 0.07 → Maximum Loan = 600,000 ÷ 0.07 = 8,571,428.57."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What inputs are required?",
        "answer": "You must provide Net Operating Income (NOI) and the Loan Amount. Optionally provide a target debt yield (as a decimal) to compute the maximum loan consistent with that target."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is debt yield the same as DSCR or LTV?",
        "answer": "No. Debt yield is NOI divided by loan amount and is independent of interest rate or amortization; DSCR considers debt service and interest rates, and LTV compares loan to property value. Use debt yield as one of several underwriting checks."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I format the target debt yield?",
        "answer": "Enter target debt yield as a decimal (for example 0.08 for 8%). The calculator will use that value directly to compute maximum allowable loan amount."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the accuracy limitations?",
        "answer": "This calculator performs straightforward arithmetic. Numerical rounding, inconsistent NOI definitions, or stale loan figures will affect results. For automated or audited uses, follow formal numerical controls and traceability per NIST and ISO recommendations, and validate results against source data."
