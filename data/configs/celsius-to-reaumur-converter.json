        "This converter transforms temperature from Celsius to Reaumur, enabling reference to historical scientific measurements.",
        "Reaumur scale is rarely used today but appears in historical scientific documents and older equipment specifications.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where the Reaumur scale has 80 divisions between water's freezing and boiling points."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "°Ré = °C × 0.8. To convert Celsius to Reaumur, multiply by 0.8. For example, 0°C = 0°Ré, 100°C = 80°Ré.",
        "Reaumur scale was created in 1731 but fell out of favor when Celsius became standardized.",
        "Historical laboratory equipment and old scientific publications may reference temperatures in Reaumur.",
        "This converter bridges modern Celsius measurements with historical Reaumur references."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Water freezing: 0°C = 0°Ré.",
        "Example 2 – Room temperature: 20°C = 16°Ré.",

        {
          "question": "What is the Reaumur temperature scale?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Why is Reaumur no longer used?",
          "answer": "Celsius became the international standard due to simpler scaling and decimal basis."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where might I encounter Reaumur temperatures?",
          "answer": "In historical scientific documents, antique laboratory equipment, and vintage specifications."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the conversion formula exactly?",
          "answer": "°Ré = °C × 0.8 or °C = °Ré / 0.8"

        {
          "question": "What is the Reaumur of absolute zero?",
          "answer": "Absolute zero is approximately -218.52°Ré."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Reaumur used anywhere today?",
          "answer": "Reaumur is essentially obsolete, replaced entirely by Celsius in scientific work."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who invented the Reaumur scale?",
          "answer": "René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur created this scale in 1731."

        {
          "question": "How does Reaumur compare to Fahrenheit?",
          "answer": "Fahrenheit (32-212) and Reaumur (0-80) have different scales; both are outdated vs. Celsius."
