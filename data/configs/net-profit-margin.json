    "introduction": [
      "Net profit margin expresses the percentage of revenue that remains after all costs, operating expenses, interest, taxes, and non‑operating items. It is a primary measure of overall profitability and company efficiency.",
      "This calculator computes net profit and common margin metrics from simple income statement inputs. Use it for quick scenario analysis and to identify whether margin pressure is coming from cost of goods, operating expenses, interest, or taxes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formulas use standard financial accounting arithmetic: profit figures are computed as revenue minus expense line items. Margins are calculated as the relevant profit divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage.",
      "Inputs should be consistent and period-matched (for example, use annual revenue with annual expenses). If working with different currencies or reporting periods, normalize before calculation. Maintain raw source numbers and rounding rules for auditability.",
      "This tool is designed for illustrative and planning purposes. For formal financial reporting, reconciliation against audited statements is required. Recommended organizational controls and measurement practices include adherence to ISO quality management principles, ISO/IEC information security controls, IEEE guidance on numerical accuracy where applicable, and occupational safety and reporting expectations defined by OSHA when inputs are operational in nature."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Net Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses - Interest Expense - Taxes + Other Income",
      "Net Profit Margin (%) = (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100",
      "Gross Margin (%) = ((Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue) × 100",
      "Operating Margin (%) = ((Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses) / Revenue) × 100"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Revenue 100,000; COGS 60,000; Operating expenses 20,000; Interest 500; Taxes 5,000; Other income 0. Net profit = 14,500. Net profit margin = 14.5%.",
      "Example 2: Use this tool to model reducing COGS by improving procurement. Reduce COGS by 5,000 and compare gross and net margins to quantify impact."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Net profit margin shows the share of revenue retained as profit after all expenses. Compare gross, operating, and net margins to isolate where profitability shifts are occurring.",
      "Verify inputs against official accounting records, and treat results as indicative unless reconciled with audited financial statements."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a good net profit margin?",
        "answer": "A 'good' margin depends on industry norms and business model. Compare to peers in the same sector. High-volume, low-margin businesses differ from specialized, high-margin services."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if revenue is zero or negative?",
        "answer": "Margins require nonzero revenue. If revenue is zero, margins are undefined and the calculator cannot compute percentage results. Negative revenue is atypical and should be reconciled with accounting records before using this tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Calculations follow basic arithmetic rules; however, accuracy depends entirely on the correctness, completeness, and period alignment of your inputs. For operational measurement and auditing, follow ISO and IEEE best practices for data collection and numerical handling, and reconcile with financial statements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I include one-off items?",
        "answer": "Yes. One-off items should be entered as 'Other Income' (positive) or as negative in that field for one-off expenses, but track them separately when evaluating normalized operating performance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "This calculator is for planning and analysis only. For regulatory filings or audited financial statements, use officially prepared and audited figures and follow regulatory accounting standards and internal controls."
