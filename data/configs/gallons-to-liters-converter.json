    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single numeric value expressed in gallons into liters using established conversion factors. It is intended for general-purpose volume conversions where the user needs a quick, precise numeric result.",
      "Note that the term \"gallon\" can refer to different definitions (for example, US liquid gallon and Imperial gallon). The conversion factor you need depends on which gallon definition applies to your context. For engineering, regulatory, or trade uses, confirm the gallon definition specified by the governing specification or contract before applying a conversion."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses fixed, exact factors defined by international and national measurement authorities. For the US liquid gallon the accepted exact conversion is 1 US liquid gallon = 3.785411784 liters. For the Imperial (UK) gallon the accepted conversion is 1 Imperial gallon = 4.54609 liters.",
      "Results are calculated by multiplying the input quantity (in gallons) by the appropriate conversion factor. For display, results are rounded as needed to match typical user expectations; critical uses should specify required significant figures and document measurement uncertainty.",
      "This tool provides numeric conversion only. It does not apply corrections for temperature-driven thermal expansion or density changes. For precise laboratory or commercial measurements, follow calibration procedures and reference densities at specified temperatures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "US liquid gallons to liters: liters = gallons × 3.785411784",
      "Imperial gallons to liters: liters = gallons × 4.54609",
      "Rounding guidance: round to an appropriate number of significant digits for your use case (commonly 3–6 significant figures). For traceable measurements, include measurement uncertainty per ISO and NIST guidance."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which gallon does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion factors above are provided for both US liquid gallons and Imperial gallons. Ensure you select or implicitly treat the input as the correct gallon definition for your use case. For regulatory, trade, or legal contexts, use the gallon definition specified in the governing document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does temperature affect the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between gallon and liter is a unit-factor conversion and is independent of temperature. However, the physical volume of a liquid changes with temperature due to thermal expansion. For laboratory or custody-transfer accuracy, correct measured volumes to a reference temperature and include uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimals should I keep?",
        "answer": "Choose precision appropriate to the application: everyday use commonly needs 2–3 decimal places; engineering or dosing may require 4–6 significant figures; legal or calibration work should follow documented uncertainty requirements from NIST/ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for regulatory reporting or trade?",
        "answer": "This tool provides conversion arithmetic only. For regulatory reporting, trade, or legally binding measurements, follow the applicable standards and measurement procedures (including calibrated instruments and documented uncertainty) as required by authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the conversion factors?",
        "answer": "The conversion factors shown are exact definitions adopted by measurement authorities for unit relationships. Practical accuracy depends on the precision of the input measurement, instrument calibration, and any environmental corrections; consult NIST and ISO guidance for measurement traceability and uncertainty quantification."

      "Use the US or Imperial gallon conversion factor that matches your context. The conversion is a simple multiplication by a fixed factor; real-world accuracy depends on measurement method, instrument calibration, and any temperature-related volume changes.",
