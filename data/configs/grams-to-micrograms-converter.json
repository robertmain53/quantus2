    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts mass values between grams (g) and micrograms (µg) using the International System of Units (SI) fixed relationship between prefixes. It is intended for quick, reliable conversions and to provide practical guidance about precision and measurement limits when working at microgram scales.",
      "The conversion is exact in mathematics: 1 gram equals 1,000,000 micrograms. Real-world measurements at the microgram level require attention to instrument resolution, calibration, and uncertainty; see the methodology and FAQs for recommendations aligned with measurement standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the SI prefix relationship between the base unit gram and the micro- prefix. The micro- prefix denotes a factor of 10^-6, so conversion uses integer powers of ten rather than empirical factors.",
      "When converting measured masses, users should consider instrument readability (smallest division), calibration traceability to national standards (for example NIST), and an uncertainty statement consistent with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM).",
      "For laboratory or regulatory work, report converted values together with the measurement uncertainty and the number of significant figures justified by instrument performance and calibration certificates."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "To convert grams to micrograms: micrograms = grams × 1,000,000 (µg = g × 10^6).",
      "To convert micrograms to grams: grams = micrograms ÷ 1,000,000 (g = µg ÷ 10^6).",
      "Choose the number of significant figures based on the measuring instrument's readability and calibration uncertainty; do not add precision by showing more digits than justified by measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.002 g → 0.002 × 1,000,000 = 2,000 µg",
      "1 g → 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 µg",
      "0.000123 g → 0.000123 × 1,000,000 = 123 µg"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical conversion between grams and micrograms is exact: 1 g = 1,000,000 µg because the micro- SI prefix equals 10^-6. Measurement uncertainty applies to observed masses, not the conversion factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report after conversion?",
        "answer": "Report significant figures consistent with the original measurement instrument and its calibration uncertainty. Do not imply greater precision by adding meaningless trailing digits after conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for laboratory dosing or regulatory submissions?",
        "answer": "You may use this converter to compute numerical conversions, but regulatory or clinical work requires traceable calibration, documented uncertainty, and compliance with applicable standards. Always include instrument calibration references and uncertainty estimates in submissions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What practical limits should I consider when measuring micrograms?",
        "answer": "Consider the balance readability (d), repeatability, environmental effects (air currents, temperature, humidity), sample handling losses, and contamination. For microgram-level work, microbalances with appropriate calibration and controlled environment are typically required."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the correct symbol for microgram?",
        "answer": "The SI symbol for microgram is µg. Use the Greek small letter mu (µ) followed by g, not the letter u or other substitutions in formal reports when possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from micrograms to grams?",
        "answer": "Divide the microgram value by 1,000,000. For example, 250,000 µg ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.25 g."
