    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a value in grams (g) to micrograms (µg) using the SI prefix relationship. The conversion is a fixed mathematical multiplication because 1 microgram equals one millionth of a gram.",
      "It is intended for quick unit conversion in laboratory notes, calculations for formulations, dosage calculations, data entry, and documentation where unit consistency is required. For reported measurements, always ensure instrument calibration and include measurement uncertainty when required by regulation or lab practice."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies the International System of Units (SI) prefix rule: the prefix micro (symbol µ) denotes 10^-6. Converting between gram and microgram is therefore a scalar multiplication by 1,000,000.",
      "For laboratory and regulatory use, conversions must be combined with measurement best practices: use traceable calibrated instruments, record uncertainty and significant figures, and follow applicable standards and exposure limits referenced by authorities such as NIST, ISO, IEEE, and OSHA."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: micrograms (µg) = grams (g) × 1,000,000.",
      "Inverse formula: grams (g) = micrograms (µg) ÷ 1,000,000.",
      "Steps: 1) Enter numerical mass in grams. 2) Multiply the numeric value by 1,000,000. 3) Report result with appropriate significant figures and units (µg)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.002 g → 0.002 × 1,000,000 = 2,000 µg",
      "1.5 g → 1.5 × 1,000,000 = 1,500,000 µg",
      "0.000001 g → 0.000001 × 1,000,000 = 1 µg (useful when moving between micro- and macro-scale quantities)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Multiply grams by 1,000,000 to get micrograms.",
      "Always combine numeric conversion with measurement uncertainty and calibration records when used for regulated reporting or scientific documentation."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the microgram symbol µg the same as mcg?",
        "answer": "Yes. µg is the SI symbol for microgram. mcg is an ASCII alternative sometimes used when the Greek letter mu is unavailable. For formal documentation and SI compliance use µg when possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the converted value?",
        "answer": "Round according to the significant figures of the original measurement and the uncertainty of your instrument. Conversion multiplies the numeric value but does not improve precision; maintain and report uncertainty consistent with laboratory practice and relevant standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert measured values directly without considering instrument limits?",
        "answer": "No. A unit conversion does not change measurement uncertainty or the instrument detection and quantitation limits. For results near an instrument's limit, report the limit, uncertainty, and whether the value is above the limit per lab procedures and regulatory requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to follow standards when using this converter for regulated reporting?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use conversions together with standards for traceability and reporting. Reference national metrology guidance and applicable ISO and regulatory requirements for documentation, calibration, and uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the converter use a fixed multiplier?",
        "answer": "SI prefixes define fixed powers of ten. Micro denotes 10^-6, so converting between grams and micrograms is a deterministic multiplication by 10^6. No empirical factors are involved in the unit conversion itself."
