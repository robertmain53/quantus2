    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts mass values from grams (g) to micrograms (µg) using the International System of Units (SI) scaling. The conversion is exact in mathematical terms: 1 gram equals 1,000,000 micrograms (1 g = 1×10^6 µg).",
      "Use this converter for laboratory calculations, dosing, trace analysis, and documentation. For regulated workflows, ensure measurement instruments are calibrated and results reported with appropriate uncertainty and significant figures."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "SI prefixes are base-10 multipliers; the prefix \"micro\" denotes 10^-6. Converting between metric units of mass is a scale multiplication or division by a power of ten.",
      "Practical accuracy depends on the measuring device and procedure. Follow traceability and calibration practices referenced by NIST and ISO when converting values that feed regulatory reports or safety limits.",
      "When reporting results, include appropriate significant figures and, where applicable, an uncertainty estimate from instrument calibration or validation data."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply grams by 1,000,000 to get micrograms: micrograms = grams × 1,000,000.",
      "Divide micrograms by 1,000,000 to get grams: grams = micrograms ÷ 1,000,000.",
      "Round results according to the number of significant figures justified by measurement uncertainty; do not imply greater precision than the input instrument supports."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 gram → 1 × 10^6 µg = 1,000,000 µg",
      "0.0025 g → 0.0025 × 1,000,000 = 2,500 µg",
      "0.000123 g → 0.000123 × 1,000,000 = 123 µg"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Conversion is a direct scaling by 10^6 (multiply grams by 1,000,000).",
      "Observational precision, instrument calibration, and reporting conventions determine how to round or report converted values in professional settings."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between grams and micrograms?",
        "answer": "Exactly 1 gram = 1,000,000 micrograms (1 g = 1×10^6 µg). The microgram symbol is µg."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert weight measured on a scale directly to micrograms?",
        "answer": "Scales measure mass; conversion between grams and micrograms is mathematical and valid for mass. If you are measuring weight under varying gravity (e.g., different planets) be careful: regulatory and scientific contexts generally assume mass in SI units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep after converting?",
        "answer": "Keep as many significant figures as are supported by the original measurement and instrument uncertainty. Consult your lab's uncertainty budget or calibration certificate; follow NIST guidance for reporting significant figures and uncertainties."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory limits expressed in micrograms?",
        "answer": "Yes. Some exposure limits and environmental concentrations use micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) or micrograms per liter (µg/L). When converting for compliance, use the exact conversion factor but ensure sampling, detection limits, and uncertainty meet regulatory requirements referenced by agencies such as OSHA."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter account for measurement uncertainty or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a mathematical scale conversion only. For certified results, combine the numeric conversion with instrument uncertainty, calibration status, and traceability to standards (for example, NIST-traceable calibrations)."
