    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a power value in kilowatts (kW) to megawatts (MW). The relationship is fixed in the International System of Units (SI): 1 kilowatt equals 1,000 watts and 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts.",
      "The converter is intended for quick, unambiguous unit changes used in engineering specifications, reporting, and high-level system planning. For energy measurements (kWh vs MWh) or instrument calibration, see the methodology and FAQs for additional guidance and standards references."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion follows the SI prefixes where kilo (k) = 10^3 and mega (M) = 10^6. Converting between kW and MW is therefore a fixed scaling by factors of 10^3.",
      "When reporting converted values for engineering, procurement, or compliance, include the number of significant digits justified by measurement uncertainty or instrument specification. Traceability to national measurement institutes is recommended when measurements inform contracts or safety limits.",
      "Standards and guidance referenced include national SI guidance, international unit standards, and industry electrical measurement practices. Examples of relevant authorities: NIST guidance on SI units, ISO series on quantities and units, IEEE measurement recommendations for power systems, and OSHA electrical safety regulations where power ratings affect safe work practices."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: MW = kW / 1000",
      "Equivalent formula: MW = kW × 0.001",
      "Steps: 1) Take the numeric value in kilowatts. 2) Divide by 1,000 to get megawatts. 3) Round according to desired significant figures or instrument uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 5 kW: 5 kW ÷ 1000 = 0.005 MW",
      "Convert 1,250 kW: 1250 kW ÷ 1000 = 1.25 MW",
      "Convert 0.75 kW: 0.75 kW ÷ 1000 = 0.00075 MW"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Kilowatt to megawatt conversions are exact scaling operations within the SI system: divide kilowatts by 1,000 to obtain megawatts.",
      "For published results, present units, indicate rounding or significant digits, and when relevant note measurement uncertainty and traceability to standards."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this the same as converting kWh to MWh?",
        "answer": "No. kW and MW measure instantaneous power (rate of energy transfer). kWh and MWh measure energy over time (power × time). Numerically, the conversion factor between kWh and MWh is the same scale (1 MWh = 1,000 kWh), but you must account for time when moving between power and energy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which formula should I use to convert kW to MW?",
        "answer": "Use MW = kW ÷ 1000, or equivalently MW = kW × 0.001. This is an exact conversion based on SI prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose significant figures consistent with the measurement uncertainty of the source value or the precision required by your application. For instrument-derived values, follow the device's accuracy specifications and document uncertainty per best practice (e.g., traceable calibration)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate instruments for valid conversions?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic conversion does not require calibration, but the accuracy of a reported power value depends on the measuring instrument. For regulatory, contractual, or safety-critical purposes, ensure instruments are calibrated and traceable to national standards and that stated uncertainties are recorded."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory considerations when reporting MW values?",
        "answer": "Yes. When power figures are used for permitting, grid interconnection, or safety assessments, follow the applicable national and industry standards and document measurement traceability. Consult regulatory and industry guidance for the relevant jurisdiction and application."
