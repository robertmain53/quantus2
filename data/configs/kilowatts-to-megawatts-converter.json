    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms power measurements from Kilowatts to Megawatts, enabling translation of large power systems to manageable scales.",
      "Industrial power plants and renewable energy farms generate megawatts, while substations distribute kilowatts. This conversion bridges utility and distribution-level measurements.",
      "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 megawatt equals exactly 1,000 Kilowatts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MW = 1,000 kW. To convert kilowatts to megawatts, divide by 1,000. For example, 500 kW = 0.5 MW, 5,000 kW = 5 MW, 100,000 kW = 100 MW.",
      "Power transmission lines carry megawatts, but substations step down to kilowatts for distribution. Converting enables system capacity understanding.",
      "Renewable energy projects report capacity in megawatts, but individual turbines or panels are rated in kilowatts. Converting enables project scale assessment.",
      "This converter provides precise power conversions for utility planning and energy infrastructure analysis."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Wind farm: A 50 MW wind farm contains multiple 5 MW turbines, useful for capacity and land use planning.",
      "Example 2 – Solar facility: A 100 MW solar plant generates 100,000 kW peak, equivalent to powering approximately 100,000 homes.",
      "Example 3 – Power plant: A 500 MW coal plant supplies 500,000 kW to the grid, essential for regional power planning."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Kilowatts to Megawatts?",
        "answer": "1 MW = 1,000 kW. Divide kilowatts by 1,000 to get megawatts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use megawatts?",
        "answer": "Megawatts simplify discussion of large power systems. It's easier to say a power plant produces 500 MW than 500,000 kW."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much power does a megawatt provide?",
        "answer": "1 MW typically powers approximately 750-1,000 homes depending on usage patterns and climate."
