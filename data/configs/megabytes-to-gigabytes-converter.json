    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms digital storage measurements from megabytes (MB) to gigabytes (GB), bridging common data size units. It is designed for users working with file sizes, storage device specifications, software requirements, and digital media dimensions.",
      "Megabytes are commonly used for individual files and moderate-sized data sets, while gigabytes are standard for storage device capacity and large data collections. Understanding this conversion is essential for storage planning, device selection, and digital asset management.",
      "The converter applies the standardized decimal relationship (1 GB = 1,000 MB) used by storage manufacturers, operating systems, and digital specifications worldwide."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The megabyte (MB) and gigabyte (GB) are units of digital data storage in the decimal system used by most storage manufacturers and operating systems. The relationship is: 1 GB = 1,000 MB (or equivalently, 1 MB = 0.001 GB). This decimal system (base 10) is the standard used in storage device labeling, software specifications, and digital media.",
      "To convert a data size from megabytes to gigabytes, you divide the MB value by 1,000. For example, 5,000 MB = 5 GB, 2,500 MB = 2.5 GB, and 750 MB = 0.75 GB. This conversion is used consistently in software installation requirements, file transfer speeds, and storage capacity planning.",
      "The converter applies straightforward decimal division internally to maintain accuracy. Results are displayed rounded to practical precision (typically two to three decimal places), suitable for storage planning, file specifications, and digital media documentation.",
      "Because this conversion uses the standard decimal system (base 10), results align with how storage manufacturers label device capacity, how operating systems report file sizes, and how software specifies storage requirements."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Software installation: A video game requiring 50,000 MB converts to 50 GB, a typical specification for modern gaming applications.",
      "Example 2 – Media file: A movie file of 4,700 MB converts to approximately 4.7 GB, typical for a full-length film in standard resolution.",
      "Example 3 – USB drive: A USB storage device holding 256,000 MB converts to 256 GB, a common capacity for portable storage devices.",
      "Example 4 – Cloud storage: A cloud backup containing 100,000 MB of data converts to 100 GB, a standard allocation for personal cloud storage plans."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between MB and GB?",
        "answer": "The megabyte (MB) and gigabyte (GB) are units of digital data storage. The relationship is straightforward: 1 GB = 1,000 MB. Megabytes are typically used for smaller files (documents, photos), while gigabytes are used for storage capacity and large data collections."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this the same as binary storage (MiB/GiB)?",
        "answer": "No. This converter uses the decimal system (1 GB = 1,000 MB), which is the standard used by storage manufacturers for device labeling and operating systems for file size reporting. The binary system (1 GiB = 1,024 MiB) is sometimes used in technical computing but is less common for consumer storage specifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if a file size is in MB or GB?",
        "answer": "Operating systems and software typically indicate the unit. For example, a 2,000 MB file is usually displayed as '2,000 MB' or '2 GB' depending on the system. This converter helps you understand the equivalent size in whichever unit is most useful for your context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do storage devices show different capacities in Windows vs Mac?",
        "answer": "Operating systems may report slightly different values due to formatting overhead, system files, or differences in how free space is calculated. However, both systems use the same MB/GB conversion standard (1 GB = 1,000 MB) for displaying file sizes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many gigabytes are on a typical external hard drive?",
        "answer": "Common external hard drives are rated at 1 TB (1,000 GB), 2 TB (2,000 GB), or 4 TB (4,000 GB). These are labeled by manufacturers using the decimal system where 1 TB = 1,000 GB."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the relationship between MB and KB?",
        "answer": "The progression is: 1 MB = 1,000 KB (kilobytes), 1 GB = 1,000 MB, 1 TB = 1,000 GB. This decimal hierarchy makes it easy to convert between any adjacent units by multiplying or dividing by 1,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do internet connection speeds relate to MB and GB?",
        "answer": "Internet speeds are measured in megabits per second (Mbps), not megabytes. To estimate download time, divide the megabits per second by 8 to get megabytes per second (MB/s), then convert to gigabytes using this converter. For example, a 100 Mbps connection = 12.5 MB/s ≈ 0.0125 GB/s."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is storage capacity less than the advertised size?",
        "answer": "Storage manufacturers rate devices using total capacity (e.g., 500 GB), but operating systems reserve space for system files, file system overhead, and formatting. A 500 GB drive typically shows about 465-475 GB of usable space. This is normal and expected with all storage devices."
