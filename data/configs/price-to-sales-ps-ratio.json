    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio using either total market capitalization divided by revenue or price per share divided by sales per share. Use consistent timeframes (for example, trailing twelve months) and currencies across inputs.",
      "The tool provides multiple calculation paths so analysts can cross-check P/S computed from headline market cap, per-share figures, or implied market cap from price and shares outstanding. Results are indicative and depend directly on the accuracy and consistency of your inputs."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formula (market-based): P/S = Market Capitalization ÷ Revenue. Market capitalization is typically share price × shares outstanding (use diluted shares if comparing to diluted-per-share metrics). Revenue should be for the same reporting period and use the same currency.",
      "Per-share formula: P/S = Price per Share ÷ Sales per Share. Sales per share is revenue divided by the same basis of shares used for price. Use this when per-share metrics are already provided.",
      "Alternative check: compute implied market capitalization as Price per Share × Shares Outstanding, then divide by Revenue. This reconciles per-share and total-company approaches and highlights differences caused by share-count adjustments (options, dilution).",
      "Adjustments and best practices: prefer trailing twelve months (TTM) for revenue when available; for forward-looking comparisons substitute consensual forward revenue. For companies with significant net debt consider Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales) instead of Market Cap-to-Sales to reflect capital structure."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Market-cap P/S: market_cap / revenue",
      "Per-share P/S: price_per_share / sales_per_share",
      "Implied market-cap P/S: (price_per_share × shares_outstanding) / revenue",
      "All inputs must use the same currency and comparable periods (for example, TTM revenue with current market cap)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Company A has market cap $2,000,000,000 and TTM revenue $500,000,000. P/S = 2,000,000,000 ÷ 500,000,000 = 4.0.",
      "Example 2: Company B has price per share $25 and sales per share $5. P/S = 25 ÷ 5 = 5.0.",
      "Example 3: Reconciliation: Price $10, shares outstanding 100,000,000 → implied market cap = $1,000,000,000. If revenue = $250,000,000, P/S = 1,000,000,000 ÷ 250,000,000 = 4.0."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use Market Cap ÷ Revenue for company-level valuation comparisons. Use Price ÷ Sales per Share when working with per-share metrics or when share count is ambiguous.",
      "Watch for differences caused by currency mismatches, fiscal-period mismatches, and share-count definitions (basic vs diluted).",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which P/S measure should I use: market-cap or per-share?",
        "answer": "Use market-cap ÷ revenue for company-level comparisons across peers. Use per-share P/S when you only have per-share inputs or when comparing per-share metrics across securities. Always ensure the same basis for shares (basic vs diluted) and revenue period."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle negative revenue?",
        "answer": "P/S is undefined or not meaningful with negative revenue. For companies with negative sales, consider using alternative metrics (for example, price-to-book or EV/EBITDA when earnings exist) and disclose limitations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use trailing revenue or forward revenue?",
        "answer": "Both are used in practice. Trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue reflects recent historical performance; forward revenue uses analyst estimates for expected performance. Be explicit about which you use when comparing companies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator account for debt?",
        "answer": "No. This tool computes market-cap-to-sales. For companies with substantial debt or cash differences, Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales) is a more appropriate measure to capture total enterprise value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are results?",
        "answer": "Calculated results are precise arithmetic based on your inputs. Accuracy depends on input quality, timing, currency, share-count methods, and rounding. Use audited financials where possible and cross-check periods and definitions."
