    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass expressed in kilograms (SI base unit) to slugs (United States customary unit of mass) using the widely accepted conversion factor. Use it when you need a quick, traceable numeric conversion for engineering, education, or documentation.",
      "Results are numeric conversions only; they do not substitute for calibrated measurements. For legal, safety-critical, or regulatory uses, verify instrument calibration and traceability to national standards before reporting or acting on converted values."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies a fixed mathematical relationship between the two units. The slug is defined in Imperial/US customary systems and is related to the kilogram through internationally recognized constants and unit definitions.",
      "For accuracy and traceability, the conversion factor used here follows published reference values from national and international standards organizations. When high precision is required, consider instrument calibration traceable to a national metrology institute and document the number of significant figures and uncertainty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: slugs = kilograms ÷ 14.593902937206",
      "Step 1: Take the mass value in kilograms.",
      "Step 2: Divide by 14.593902937206 to obtain mass in slugs. Round the result to the number of significant digits appropriate for your context."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 kilogram → 1 ÷ 14.593902937206 = 0.068521764 slugs (rounded as needed).",
      "Example 2: 50 kilograms → 50 ÷ 14.593902937206 = 3.4260882 slugs."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor is used and why?",
        "answer": "This converter uses 1 slug = 14.593902937206 kilograms, a value consistent with standard references derived from the definitions of the pound, foot, and second and harmonized with SI through internationally accepted constants. For publication or regulatory work, cite a standards body such as NIST or ISO and state the factor and rounding used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the slug a unit of mass or weight?",
        "answer": "The slug is a unit of mass. Weight is a force (commonly expressed in newtons or pounds-force) and depends on local acceleration due to gravity. Converting mass units (kilograms ↔ slugs) is independent of local gravity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "Report the same number of significant digits supported by your input measurement and its known uncertainty. For laboratory or engineering work, include measurement uncertainty and reference calibration status. When uncertain, use three significant digits for general engineering and more as required by analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there known limitations or sources of error?",
        "answer": "Conversion arithmetic itself is exact to the digits used, but real-world error arises from measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration, and rounding. For high-precision needs, include uncertainty propagation and ensure instruments are calibrated traceable to national standards (see NIST)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I prefer kilograms over slugs?",
        "answer": "Use kilograms for SI-compliant work, international collaboration, and most scientific and engineering contexts. Use slugs when working within US customary engineering conventions that require that unit or when interfacing with legacy systems that use slugs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to adjust for local gravity to convert between kg and slugs?",
        "answer": "No. Converting between kilograms and slugs is a mass-to-mass conversion and does not require local gravity. Only conversions between mass and force (for example kilogram to pound-force) require gravitational acceleration."
