    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass value expressed in kilograms (SI base unit) to slugs (mass unit used in some imperial/US customary contexts). The relationship is a fixed mathematical ratio and the result is intended for unit-conversion purposes only.",
      "The slug is defined such that 1 slug ≈ 14.593902937206 kilograms. Use this converter when you need consistent unit translation for calculations, documentation, or engineering notes that reference both SI and imperial units.",
      "When using converted values for measurements, calculations, or regulatory compliance, account for measurement uncertainty and ensure equipment is calibrated to traceable standards where required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This converter uses the internationally accepted fixed conversion factor between the two units as documented by recognized standards authorities. The conversion is algebraic and does not depend on context, force, or local gravity because both units here are quantities of mass.",
      "For engineering, laboratory, or procurement use, we recommend that measured masses be reported with an uncertainty and that weighing instruments be calibrated to NIST-traceable or equivalent national standards as applicable to your jurisdiction.",
      "Relevant standards and guidance include NIST publications on units and values, the ISO 80000 series on quantities and units, and general standards on unit representation and reporting. Follow applicable workplace and safety guidance (for example ergonomics and material-handling recommendations) when applying converted mass values in operations."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Conversion principle: mass_in_slugs = mass_in_kilograms ÷ 14.593902937206.",
      "Step 1: Take the mass in kilograms (kg). Step 2: Divide by 14.593902937206 to obtain mass in slugs (slug).",
      "Round results according to required significant figures or measurement uncertainty; do not assume infinite precision from the conversion factor alone."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 kg → 1 ÷ 14.593902937206 ≈ 0.0685218 slug.",
      "70 kg → 70 ÷ 14.593902937206 ≈ 4.79652 slug (rounded to 5 significant figures).",
      "100 kg → 100 ÷ 14.593902937206 ≈ 6.85218 slug."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter provides a direct algebraic translation from kilograms to slugs using the fixed factor 1 slug ≈ 14.593902937206 kg. Apply appropriate rounding and document measurement uncertainty when using results for technical or regulatory work."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a slug?",
        "answer": "A slug is a unit of mass used in some imperial/US customary systems. It is defined so that 1 slug is approximately 14.593902937206 kilograms."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion affected by gravity?",
        "answer": "No. Both kilogram and slug as used here are units of mass. Converting mass units is a fixed algebraic operation and does not require a local gravity value. Converting between mass and force (for example, slugs vs pound-force) would involve acceleration due to gravity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "Report results with as many significant digits as justified by the measurement uncertainty of the input. The conversion factor itself is known to many digits, but measurement uncertainty is typically dominated by the instrument used to obtain the mass in kilograms."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate weighing equipment to use converted values in regulated work?",
        "answer": "Yes. For regulated, safety-critical, or legally binding measurements, use weighing equipment calibrated to a national metrology institute or a certified calibration provider and document traceability to NIST or the appropriate national standard."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion factor?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor is exact to the precision quoted for unit-conversion purposes as provided by authoritative references. Practical accuracy is limited by the input measurement precision and instrument calibration."
