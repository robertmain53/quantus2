1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion requires a variable exchange rate (and optional fees/rounding) so the calculation needs a formula with multiple inputs (amount, exchange rate, optional fee or spread), not a fixed unit-to-unit constant.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, meta, canonical_url, robots, schema_org, open_graph, form for converters, or any other disallowed keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
