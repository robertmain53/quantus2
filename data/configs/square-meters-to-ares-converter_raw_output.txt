1. This is a converter because the task is a fixed, one-to-one unit conversion (square meters ↔ square feet) with a single numeric input and a single numeric output; no additional variables or conditional methods are required.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if used).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, styling, or other custom fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
