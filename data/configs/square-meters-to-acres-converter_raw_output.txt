1. This is a converter because converting square meters to square feet is a fixed mathematical relationship with a single numeric input and a single numeric output (no additional variables or intermediate steps required).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary arrays if needed).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, no robots, no schema_org beyond the allowed schema.additionalTypes, no UI or layout fields, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
