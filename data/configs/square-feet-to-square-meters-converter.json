    "introduction": [
      "Convert area values between square feet (ft²) and square meters (m²) for architecture, real estate, engineering, construction, and reporting.",
      "This converter uses the internationally adopted exact relation (1 foot = 0.3048 meters) so results are precise and consistent with SI standards. Consider measurement precision and rounding when using converted values in specifications or regulatory documents."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is derived from the fixed SI relationship for the foot: 1 foot is defined as exactly 0.3048 meters. Squaring that linear relationship gives the area factor used here.",
      "Using the exact definition eliminates cumulative rounding error from chained conversions. For reporting and compliance, use the number of decimal places appropriate to the measurement method (see FAQs).",
      "For regulatory and standards context, we follow international SI guidance and national metrology authorities to ensure traceability of the conversion factor."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with the exact linear definition: 1 ft = 0.3048 m.",
      "Step 2: Square the linear conversion to convert area: 1 ft² = (0.3048 m)² = 0.09290304 m².",
      "Step 3: Multiply the value in ft² by 0.09290304 to obtain m² (m² = ft² × 0.09290304)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 ft² × 0.09290304 = 9.290304 m²",
      "500 ft² × 0.09290304 = 46.45152 m²",
      "1,000 ft² × 0.09290304 = 92.90304 m²"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use the exact factor 0.09290304 to convert ft² to m². Multiply the square feet value by this factor and round according to the measurement accuracy required for your use case."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from square feet to square meters?",
        "answer": "1 square foot = 0.09290304 square meters. This comes from 1 foot = 0.3048 meters (exact), then squaring that linear factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is 1 foot defined as exactly 0.3048 meters?",
        "answer": "The international definition was agreed and fixed to ensure uniformity between imperial and metric units. National metrology institutes document this definition to provide traceability to SI units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round converted values and to how many decimals?",
        "answer": "Round according to measurement precision and your application. For architectural floor areas, two decimal places (0.01 m²) are common; for engineering or scientific work you may keep more digits. Always note both the conversion precision and the original measurement uncertainty when reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for the US survey foot?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the international foot (1 ft = 0.3048 m). The US survey foot differs slightly; if you require conversions tied to historical survey data, use a specialized tool that explicitly supports the US survey foot to avoid small positional or area discrepancies."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do measurement errors affect converted area values?",
        "answer": "Measurement uncertainty in linear dimensions propagates into area as roughly double in relative terms (e.g., a ±1% error in each linear measurement can produce about ±2% error in area). Where precision matters, account for instrument tolerance and measurement method when reporting converted areas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from square meters to square feet?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the inverse factor: 1 m² = 1 ÷ 0.09290304 ≈ 10.7639104167 ft². Multiply square meters by this factor to get square feet."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I reference the conversion factor for compliance or technical documents?",
        "answer": "Reference national metrology guidance or the SI brochure from international authorities. Citing the SI definition and the national metrology institute (for example, NIST in the United States or BIPM internationally) provides traceability for technical and regulatory submissions."
