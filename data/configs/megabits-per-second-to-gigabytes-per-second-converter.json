    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a transfer rate expressed in megabits per second (Mbps) into gigabytes per second (GB/s). It supports the common decimal interpretation used in networking and explains the binary (GiB) alternative used sometimes for storage.",
      "Use this tool when you need to compare network link speeds (usually specified in bits per second) with application-level or storage throughput numbers (commonly expressed in bytes per second). The page includes method notes, worked examples, and references to standards to help you choose the correct interpretation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Network speeds are typically specified in bits per second and use SI (decimal) prefixes: mega = 10^6, giga = 10^9. Bytes are 8 bits. The standard, recommended default for network conversions is the decimal approach.",
      "Storage contexts sometimes use binary prefixes (mebi, gibi) where 1 mebibyte = 2^20 bytes and 1 gibibyte = 2^30 bytes. This converter shows both decimal GB and binary GiB results and explains when each is appropriate.",
      "Accuracy and reporting: round results to a sensible number of significant digits for your use case (for example, three decimal places for GB/s in performance summaries). For compliance, calibration, or contractual metrics, follow the measurement and reporting practices in applicable standards and test methodologies."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (recommended for networking) step-by-step:",
      "1) Interpret 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits per second (10^6 bits/s).",
      "2) Convert bits to bytes: divide by 8 (bits → bytes).",
      "3) Convert bytes to gigabytes: divide by 1,000,000,000 (10^9).",
      "Combined decimal formula: GB/s (decimal) = Mbps × 10^6 / 8 / 10^9 = Mbps × 0.000125.",
      "Binary (GiB) alternative (storage-oriented): use 1 Mib = 2^20 bits and 1 GiB = 2^30 bytes. Combined binary formula: GiB/s = Mbps × 2^20 / 8 / 2^30 = Mbps × (1 / 8 / 2^10) ≈ Mbps × 0.0001220703125."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 Mbps → decimal GB/s: 1000 × 0.000125 = 0.125 GB/s.",
      "50000 Mbps → decimal GB/s: 50000 × 0.000125 = 6.25 GB/s.",
      "1000 Mbps → binary GiB/s: 1000 × 0.0001220703125 ≈ 0.12207 GiB/s."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which interpretation should I use: decimal GB/s or binary GiB/s?",
        "answer": "For network link speeds and most WAN/LAN measurements use the decimal SI prefixes (mega = 10^6, giga = 10^9). Use binary (mebi/gibi) when the context, tooling, or vendor explicitly uses binary prefixes for storage capacity or memory."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert Gbps (gigabits per second) to GB/s?",
        "answer": "Apply the same steps: convert bits to bytes by dividing by 8, then apply the prefix conversion. For decimal: GB/s = Gbps × 10^9 / 8 / 10^9 = Gbps / 8. So 1 Gbps = 0.125 GB/s (decimal)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding or precision is recommended?",
        "answer": "Round to a level appropriate for the audience. For operational dashboards, two to three decimal places for GB/s is common. For contractual measurements, preserve the precision required by the agreement and document the prefix convention used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards references for these units?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use SI (decimal) prefixes per national metrology guidance and ISO/IEC/IEC standards for unit naming conventions. For networking equipment and link definitions refer to relevant IEEE standards such as IEEE 802.3 for Ethernet. Consult your organization's measurement and reporting requirements for compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What causes discrepancies between advertised link rates and observed throughput?",
        "answer": "Advertised link rates are physical-layer maximums (bits/s). Observed application throughput is affected by protocol overhead (headers, retransmissions), encoding, congestion, and the difference between bit vs byte reporting. Always convert using the same prefix rules and account for protocol overhead when comparing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter exact?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between bits and bytes is exact (8 bits = 1 byte). Differences arise from prefix interpretation (decimal vs binary) and measurement/rounding. See accuracy caveats in the citations and consider test method precision for critical measurements."
