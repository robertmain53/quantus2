    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes nominal and real annualized returns from an initial investment and a projected future value, and it converts the projected future value into today's dollars using an input annual inflation rate. Use it to estimate how inflation erodes purchasing power and to compare investments on a real (inflation‑adjusted) basis.",
      "Enter the initial amount, expected future value at the end of the holding period, the number of years, and an annual inflation rate (percent). The tool reports the nominal annualized return, the real annualized return after inflation, and the inflation‑adjusted future value expressed in present‑day terms."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Nominal annualized return is calculated by converting the total growth factor to a per‑year rate using the nth root: (FV / PV)^(1 / years) - 1.",
      "Real (inflation‑adjusted) annualized return uses the Fisher adjustment: (1 + nominal) / (1 + inflation) - 1, where inflation is entered as an annual percentage and converted to decimal form in calculations.",
      "Inflation‑adjusted future value is computed by discounting the nominal future value by the compounded inflation factor: FV / (1 + inflation)^years. This returns the amount of purchasing power in today's dollars."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Nominal annualized return = pow(future_value / initial_investment, 1 / years) - 1",
      "Real annualized return = (1 + nominal_annual_return) / (1 + annual_inflation_pct/100) - 1",
      "Inflation‑adjusted future value = future_value / pow(1 + annual_inflation_pct/100, years)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: PV = 10,000; FV = 15,000; years = 5; inflation = 2% → nominal ≈ 8.45% annually; real ≈ 6.24% annually; inflation‑adjusted FV ≈ 13,600 in today's dollars.",
      "Example 2: PV = 50,000; FV = 100,000; years = 10; inflation = 3% → nominal ≈ 7.18% annually; real ≈ 3.99% annually; inflation‑adjusted FV ≈ 74,409 in today's dollars."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This tool provides quick visibility into nominal and real returns and how inflation affects purchasing power over time. Use conservative inflation estimates for stress tests and compare multiple scenarios to understand sensitivity."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should I enter inflation as a percent or decimal?",
        "answer": "Enter inflation as a percentage (for example, enter 2 for 2%). The calculator converts percentage inputs to decimals internally by dividing by 100."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this calculator for short time periods or negative inflation?",
        "answer": "Yes. Years can be fractional for sub‑year periods. Negative inflation (deflation) is allowed within the field limits, but interpret results carefully because high negative or very large inflation values can produce counterintuitive outcomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the results and what are the limitations?",
        "answer": "Results are mathematical estimates based on the inputs and the formulas shown. Rounding, floating point representation, and input accuracy affect outputs. This calculator is for informational purposes and not financial advice. See the accuracy and standards section for numeric and security considerations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I only know a nominal annual rate and want the real rate?",
        "answer": "If you have a nominal annual rate r (in percent), convert to decimal r/100 and use real = (1 + r/100) / (1 + inflation/100) - 1. This tool derives nominal rate from PV, FV, and years when those are provided."
