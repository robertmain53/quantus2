    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a quantity given in minutes into days using the standard fixed relationship between these time units. It is intended for everyday calculations, scheduling, data conversion, and spreadsheet workflows where minutes must be expressed as fractional or whole days.",
      "The tool assumes the conventional civil day of exactly 24 hours (86,400 seconds) so the conversion is minutes ÷ 1,440. See the methodology and FAQs below for accuracy caveats such as leap seconds, astronomical days, and recommended rounding practices when preparing regulatory or legal records."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base definition: Time in this converter is derived from the SI base unit (second). One minute = 60 seconds; one hour = 60 minutes; one day (civil) = 24 hours = 1,440 minutes. The conversion therefore uses the exact mathematical ratio minutes ÷ 1,440 = days.",
      "When high-precision civil timekeeping or legal timestamps are required, follow standards for time representation (for example ISO 8601) and authoritative time sources. For applications sensitive to leap seconds or astronomical variations, consult national time services and international timekeeping authorities before assuming continuous fixed-length days.",
      "Recommended precision: For general use show at least 6 significant digits for fractional days when converting nontrivial minute values; for reporting or compliance purposes round according to the target standard or organization policy (for example to nearest minute, hour, or day)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core formula: days = minutes / 1440",
      "For a days/hours/minutes/seconds breakdown: total_seconds = minutes × 60; days = floor(total_seconds / 86400); remainder_seconds = total_seconds - days × 86400; hours = floor(remainder_seconds / 3600); minutes = floor((remainder_seconds % 3600) / 60); seconds = remainder_seconds % 60.",
      "Rounding guidance: To convert and present a fractional day to N decimal places, compute days = minutes / 1440 and round to N decimals. For display as days + hours + minutes, use integer division and modulo as described above to avoid cumulative rounding error."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1,440 minutes → 1 day (1440 ÷ 1440 = 1).",
      "Example 2: 1,500 minutes → 1.0416667 days (1500 ÷ 1440 ≈ 1.0416666667).",
      "Example 3 (breakdown): 3,500 minutes → total seconds = 210000; days = 2; remainder seconds = 4200; hours = 1; minutes = 10; seconds = 0. Result: 2 days, 1 hour, 10 minutes."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion from minutes to days exact?",
        "answer": "Using the civil-day definition (24 hours per day) the mathematical conversion minutes ÷ 1,440 is exact. However, for astronomical time or when accounting for leap seconds, civil days can be adjusted; in those contexts additional authoritative time data should be used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about leap seconds when converting minutes to days?",
        "answer": "Leap seconds are periodic one-second adjustments introduced to keep Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) aligned with Earth's rotation. They rarely affect everyday conversions. If your application requires strict synchronization with UTC for legal, scientific, or telecommunications purposes, consult national time services and adjust using official leap-second logs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding/precision should I use?",
        "answer": "For general use, rounding to 6–8 significant digits for fractional days is typically sufficient. For reporting to regulators or in contracts, follow the rounding rules specified by the relevant standard or policy (for example, round to the nearest minute or hour)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "This converter handles numeric values within typical floating-point ranges. Extremely large values (beyond double-precision safe integers) may lose precision in some environments; for bulk data transformations use arbitrary-precision libraries or integer-second arithmetic where required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standards govern how I should record or display converted times?",
        "answer": "Use ISO 8601 for formatting timestamps and date/time intervals. For measurement accuracy and time dissemination best practices consult national metrology institutes and standards organizations. See citations for links to authoritative resources."
