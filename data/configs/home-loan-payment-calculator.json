      "This calculator compares standard monthly mortgage payments with two common bi‑weekly approaches: (A) bi‑weekly payments sized to amortize the loan over the same original term (26 payments per year); and (B) bi‑weekly payments equal to half the monthly payment (commonly used to accelerate payoff because it creates the equivalent of 13 monthly payments per year).",
      "Use the fields below to enter your loan amount, APR, and term. Results show payment amounts, total paid, total interest, and estimated time to payoff for the half‑monthly bi‑weekly schedule. Results are estimates for planning only."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard annuity (level‑payment) amortization formulas. The periodic payment for a schedule with period rate r and N periods is: payment = (r * principal) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-N)).",
      "For monthly results r = APR/12 and N = years*12. For bi‑weekly amortization r = APR/26 and N = years*26. For the common acceleration method (half the monthly payment every two weeks) we compute the number of bi‑weekly periods required to amortize with that fixed payment using the inverse of the annuity formula: N = -ln(1 - r*principal/payment) / ln(1+r)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert APR to period rate: monthly = APR/12; bi‑weekly = APR/26.",
      "Step 2: Compute level payment using annuity formula for the chosen period and N periods (term*periods_per_year).",
      "Step 3 (half‑monthly method): compute payment = monthly_payment/2, then solve for N using the inverse annuity formula to find payoff time and total paid.",
      "Step 4: Total interest = total paid - principal. Interest savings and time saved are computed by comparing totals and payoff years."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do some bi‑weekly plans pay off faster?",
        "answer": "If you pay half the monthly payment every two weeks you make 26 half‑payments per year, which equals 13 full monthly payments per year. That extra annual payment accelerates principal reduction and shortens the loan term."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the APR divided by 26 always correct for bi‑weekly?",
        "answer": "This calculator assumes periodic interest = APR/26 (nominal APR divided by periods per year). Actual lenders may use different compounding conventions; always confirm the lender's interest compounding and payment application rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round payment amounts?",
        "answer": "Payments are typically rounded to cents by lenders. Small rounding differences can change the final payment or last payment slightly; for planning use unrounded values and expect minor differences in a real loan schedule."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Results are estimates. They assume fixed APR, no fees, and that each payment is applied immediately to interest then principal. They do not model escrow, fees, prepayment penalties, interest rate changes, or payment timing irregularities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my lender requires a different bi‑weekly schedule?",
        "answer": "If the lender applies payments on specific dates, calculates interest using actual/365 or other day-counts, or charges processing fees, the real amortization will differ. Use lender-provided amortization schedules for exact figures."
