Mostly obsolete units."},{"question":"How long to download 50 KB?","answer":"At 56 kbps: 7 seconds. At 1000 kbps: 0.4 seconds."},{"question":"Why is kilobit important historically?","answer":"Dial-up era standard. Speeds advertised in kbps. Now mostly Mbps/Gbps."},{"question":"Are kilobytes relevant today?","answer":"Not really. Jumped to MB/GB for practical use.
