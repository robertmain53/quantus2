    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates values from kilobytes to kilobits using standards-aware rules. The numeric relationship is fixed once you choose which prefix convention to apply (decimal SI or binary IEC).",
      "In common SI usage 1 kilobyte (kB) = 1,000 bytes and 1 kilobit (kbit) = 1,000 bits, so the conversion is straightforward. Computing contexts sometimes use binary prefixes (kibibyte, kibibit) where 1 KiB = 1,024 bytes. This tool documents both approaches and tells you which to pick for storage, memory, and networking scenarios."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We follow international standards for prefixes: SI (decimal) prefixes from the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) / NIST guidance when the context is decimal, and IEC binary prefixes when the context is binary (memory addresses, low-level binary quantities).",
      "Conversion is performed by converting the source unit to bits, applying the chosen prefix base (1,000 or 1,024), and then expressing the result in the requested target unit. This ensures traceability to SI/IEC definitions and avoids ambiguity.",
      "When you convert values used in networking (bandwidth, transfer rates) prefer the decimal (SI) interpretation; when working with computer memory or some OS reports, confirm whether the system uses binary (IEC) prefixes and convert accordingly."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) path — common for networking and most tools: kilobits = kilobytes × 8. Reason: 1 kB = 1,000 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits, so 1 kB = 8 kbit.",
      "Binary (IEC) path — used for some memory/reporting: kibibits = kibibytes × 8. Reason: 1 KiB = 1,024 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits, so 1 KiB = 8 Kibit (8192 bits).",
      "General unambiguous method (both cases): bits = bytes × 8; bytes = kilobytes × (1,000 or 1,024); target kilobits = bits ÷ 1,000 (for kbit) or ÷ 1,024 (for Kibit) depending on prefix semantics."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example (decimal/SI): 1 kB → 8 kbit.",
      "Example (decimal/SI): 200 kB → 1,600 kbit.",
      "Example (binary/IEC): 1 KiB → 8 Kibit (8192 bits)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between kilobytes and kilobits?",
        "answer": "Under the decimal (SI) convention, 1 kilobyte (kB) = 1,000 bytes and 1 kilobit (kbit) = 1,000 bits, so 1 kB = 8 kbit. If using binary (IEC) prefixes, 1 kibibyte (KiB) = 1,024 bytes and 1 kibibit (Kibit) = 1,024 bits, so 1 KiB = 8 Kibit."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use decimal (1,000) vs binary (1,024) prefixes?",
        "answer": "Use decimal (SI) prefixes for networking and most file-transfer or storage vendor specifications (they usually use powers of 1,000). Use binary (IEC) prefixes when working with low-level memory sizes or when an OS reports sizes in powers of 1,024. Check the context or documentation to choose the correct convention."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do storage devices and operating systems show different sizes for the same file?",
        "answer": "Manufacturers often advertise capacity in decimal (1,000) units, while some operating systems report sizes using binary (1,024) units. That mismatch causes apparent differences. Converting with the correct prefix base resolves the discrepancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert a rate like kB/s to kbps (kilobits per second)?",
        "answer": "Treat it the same way but preserve the per-second unit: kilobits per second = kilobytes per second × 8 (if both using decimal). For accuracy, also confirm whether the rate uses decimal vs binary prefixes and whether 'kB/s' refers to kilo-bytes/sec or kibibytes/sec."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are conversions and how should I round?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic relationship is exact given the chosen definitions (×8 and base 1,000 or 1,024). Round results for presentation according to your use case (e.g., two decimal places for human-readable network metrics; integer bytes for storage capacity). For regulatory or reporting use, follow your organization's rounding policies and cite the prefix convention used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do these definitions come from and how can I verify them?",
        "answer": "Prefix definitions follow international standards and guidance from national metrology institutes. For SI decimal prefixes see BIPM and NIST guidance; for binary prefixes see IEC publications and recognized technical references. Links to authoritative sources are provided in the citations below."
