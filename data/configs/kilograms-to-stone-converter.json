      "This converter transforms weight measurements from Kilograms to Stone, enabling understanding of UK weight specifications.",
      "Body weight and health measurements in the UK use stone and pounds. Converting from kilograms helps interpretation.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 stone equals approximately 6.35029 kilograms."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 stone ≈ 6.35029 kg. To convert kilograms to stone, divide by 6.35029. For example, 64 kg ≈ 10 stone, 76 kg ≈ 12 stone.",
      "Medical records in metric countries express weight in kilograms, requiring conversion for UK healthcare communication.",
      "Fitness and weight loss goals often compare metric kilograms to imperial stone measurements.",
      "This converter provides precise weight conversions for international contexts."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Metric to UK: A 70 kg person weighs approximately 11 stone.",
      "Example 2 – Healthcare: A patient weighing 85 kg is approximately 13.4 stone.",
      "Example 3 – Fitness: A 5 kg weight loss equals approximately 0.79 stone."

      {
        "question": "How do I convert stone and pounds to kg?",
        "answer": "1 stone = 6.35 kg. 1 pound = 0.453 kg. Stone weight + (pounds × 0.453)."
