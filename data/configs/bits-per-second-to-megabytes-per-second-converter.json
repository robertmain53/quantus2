At 100 MB/s: 10 seconds."},{"question":"Is MB/s or Mbps faster?","answer":"MB/s is 8x faster. 1 MB/s = 8 Mbps. Don't confuse the units!"},{"question":"What limits download speed?","answer":"ISP tier, distance, equipment, network congestion, server capacity."},{"question":"Why is my download slower than advertised?","answer":"ISP advertises Mbps. Actual speeds 50-80% of advertised.
