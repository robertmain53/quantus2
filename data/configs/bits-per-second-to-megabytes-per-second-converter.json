    "introduction": [
      "Convert a data rate expressed in bits per second (b/s) into megabytes per second (MB/s) for quick comparison between network link rates and observed file-transfer speeds.",
      "This tool uses the common SI / networking convention that 1 megabyte (MB) = 1,000,000 bytes unless otherwise noted. Where appropriate we explain the binary alternative (MiB) used in some operating systems and storage reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Network throughput is typically measured in bits per second. To convert to bytes per second divide by 8, then scale according to the chosen megabyte definition.",
      "For most networking and ISP specifications, decimal prefixes are used (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes). For compatibility with standards and scientific references we follow SI decimal prefixes by default and cite NIST guidance on units.",
      "When exact binary measures are required (1 MiB = 2^20 bytes), use the binary alternative described below. Real-world throughput can be lower than the line rate because of protocol overhead, retransmissions, and device limits; see FAQs for practical notes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal MB (default): MB/s = (bits per second) / 8 / 10^6. Example: 8,000,000 b/s = 1.0 MB/s.",
      "Binary MiB (alternative): MiB/s = (bits per second) / 8 / 2^20. Example: 8,388,608 b/s ≈ 1.0 MiB/s.",
      "Rounding: results are typically rounded to a sensible number of decimals for display; use higher-precision reporting where needed for measurement or billing purposes."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 10,000,000 b/s → 10,000,000 / 8 / 1,000,000 = 1.25 MB/s (decimal MB).",
      "Example 2: 100,000,000 b/s → 100,000,000 / 8 / 1,000,000 = 12.5 MB/s (decimal MB).",
      "Example 3 (binary): 10,485,760 b/s → 10,485,760 / 8 / 1,048,576 = 1.25 MiB/s (binary MiB)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do you divide by 8 to convert bits to bytes?",
        "answer": "There are 8 bits in a byte by definition. To convert a bit-based rate to a byte-based rate divide by 8, then apply the megabyte scaling (decimal or binary) as appropriate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between MB/s and MiB/s and which should I use?",
        "answer": "MB (megabyte) usually follows decimal SI prefixes where 1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes. MiB (mebibyte) uses binary prefixes where 1 MiB = 2^20 = 1,048,576 bytes. Use MB for networking and ISP rates (decimal); use MiB when working with binary storage/reporting or operating-system file sizes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my file transfer show lower MB/s than my advertised network speed?",
        "answer": "Advertised speeds are often link-layer or physical-layer maximums (bits/s) and do not account for protocol overhead (headers, encryption), TCP/IP inefficiencies, congestion, latency, or hardware limitations. Real-world throughput is commonly lower; perform measurements with controlled tests for precise results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this conversion for billing, regulation, or lab measurements?",
        "answer": "This conversion performs an exact arithmetic transformation between units. For billing or regulated measurements, follow the standard specified by the contracting party or regulator (for example, whether decimal or binary prefixes are required) and consider instrument calibration, measurement interval, and aggregation rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert using binary megabytes (MiB) instead of decimal megabytes (MB)?",
        "answer": "Yes. The tool documents the binary alternative and the formula. Use the binary calculation (divide by 2^20 after converting to bytes) when you need MiB-based reporting, such as certain storage or OS-level displays."
