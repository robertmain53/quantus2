    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length in centimetres to an equivalent value expressed in feet and inches. It applies the international, exact definition of the inch (1 inch = 2.54 centimetres) and the conventional foot (1 foot = 12 inches) so results are consistent with internationally accepted units.",
      "The converter is intended for everyday engineering, medical, and personal use where a quick and reliable translation between metric and imperial length units is needed. For applications requiring legally traceable measurements, follow instrument calibration and uncertainty documentation as described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed using the internationally agreed relationship that 1 inch equals exactly 2.54 centimetres. This value is exact by definition and is used by national measurement institutes and international standards bodies.",
      "The computation converts centimetres to total inches (centimetres divided by 2.54) then separates whole feet by integer division by 12 and computes the remaining inches. Rounding is applied to the desired resolution and measurement uncertainty is noted.",
      "For high-reliability contexts, follow NIST and ISO guidance on measurement traceability and uncertainty reporting. Calibrate measuring devices against certified standards at intervals recommended by your quality management procedures and applicable regulations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert centimetres to inches: inches = centimetres ÷ 2.54 (exact definition).",
      "Step 2: Determine whole feet: feet = floor(inches ÷ 12).",
      "Step 3: Compute remaining inches: remaining_inches = inches − (feet × 12).",
      "Rounding guidance: present remaining_inches to the needed precision (e.g., to nearest 0.01 in for two decimal places, or to nearest 1/8 in for customary fractional inches). Always state rounding or truncation method used."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 180 cm → inches = 180 ÷ 2.54 = 70.8661 in → feet = 5, remaining = 10.8661 in → 5 ft 10.87 in (rounded to 2 decimal places).",
      "Example 2: 100 cm → inches = 39.3701 in → feet = 3, remaining = 3.3701 in → 3 ft 3.37 in.",
      "Example 3: 30.48 cm → inches = 12 in → feet = 1, remaining = 0 in → 1 ft 0 in (exact by definition: 30.48 cm = 12 in)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factors does this tool use?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the exact international definition 1 inch = 2.54 centimetres and 1 foot = 12 inches. These relationships are fixed and universally accepted for unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are results rounded and how should I choose precision?",
        "answer": "Rounding depends on your use case. For general use, two decimal places for inches is common. For carpentry or machining, round to the nearest 1/16 or 1/8 inch as needed. For compliance or scientific reporting, follow your organization's significant-figure and uncertainty rules and document the rounding method."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative or very large values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Arithmetic conversion applies to negative and large magnitudes. For extremely large or small values, ensure numerical display and storage in your system support the required range and precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate measuring tools before converting?",
        "answer": "Conversion itself is purely mathematical and does not require calibration. However, for accurate real-world measurements (the input to the converter), measuring instruments should be calibrated according to NIST/ISO traceability practices and your quality procedures to quantify measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion appropriate for legal or safety-critical measurements?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact given the defined factors, but legal or safety-critical applications often require instrument calibration records, uncertainty budgets, and compliance with occupational or industry standards. Consult relevant regulations and maintain traceability to national standards."
