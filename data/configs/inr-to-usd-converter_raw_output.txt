1. This is a converter because the user wants to convert a single value from one unit (Indian Rupee) to another unit (US Dollar) and expects one output; the UI is a one-input → one-output conversion tool.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata, no form for a converter, no UI/layout/styling keys, no schema_org or open_graph, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
