    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates the concrete volume for a single round pier (cylindrical pier) using measured diameter and depth. Results include a user-adjustable waste allowance so you can better plan orders and deliveries.",
      "Outputs are presented in cubic feet, cubic yards, and cubic meters to match common ready-mix ordering units and international specifications. Use the waste allowance to account for spillage, over-excavation, or formwork irregularities."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We compute the geometric volume of a cylinder using the standard formula for a circular prism and then apply the user-specified waste allowance to produce an order-ready estimate.",
      "Inputs are interpreted as inches. The calculator converts inches to feet for volumetric units (1 foot = 12 inches) and uses the exact mathematical constant π = 3.141592653589793 for area calculations.",
      "This tool gives an estimate for material planning. Confirm final ordering quantities with your supplier and follow local building codes (for reinforcement, footing size, and frost-depth requirements)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Convert diameter and depth from inches to feet: diameter_feet = diameter_in / 12; depth_feet = depth_in / 12.",
      "Step 2 — Compute cylinder volume (cubic feet): V_cuft = π × (radius_feet)^2 × depth_feet where radius_feet = diameter_feet / 2.",
      "Step 3 — Apply waste allowance: V_with_waste = V_cuft × (1 + waste_pct / 100).",
      "Step 4 — Convert to cubic yards: V_cuyd = V_with_waste / 27. Convert to cubic meters: V_m3 = V_with_waste × 0.028316846592."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why are inputs in inches and outputs in cubic yards, cubic feet, and cubic meters?",
        "answer": "Inches are commonly used on-site for pier measurements. The calculator converts to cubic feet for precise volume math and then to cubic yards (common ready-mix ordering unit) and cubic meters for international projects."
      },
      {
        "question": "What waste percentage should I use?",
        "answer": "A typical default is 10% for small pours to cover spillage and minor measurement variance. For complex forms, large aggregates, or difficult access, increase the allowance. Consult your supplier for recommended overage for the specific job."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for piers with tapered or stepped profiles?",
        "answer": "This calculator assumes a straight cylindrical pier. For tapered or stepped piers, break the pier into separate cylindrical segments, calculate each segment's volume, then sum the results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this estimate for ordering ready-mix?",
        "answer": "This is a geometry-based estimate and does not account for mix consolidation, reinforcement displacement, or formwork irregularities. Round up to the next convenient delivery increment (often 0.25 or 0.5 cu yd) and verify minimum delivery sizes with your concrete supplier."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I measure to reduce error?",
        "answer": "Measure diameter and depth at multiple points and use the largest reasonable values where appropriate. Account for excavation sloping and sub-base material when measuring depth intended for concrete placement."
