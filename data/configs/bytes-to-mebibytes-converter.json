    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a quantity expressed in bytes into mebibytes (MiB) using the exact binary definition. Mebibyte (MiB) is a binary prefix unit defined by international standards to mean 2^20 bytes.",
      "Use this tool when you need an unambiguous, standards-based conversion (for example, technical documentation, storage capacity calculations, or data engineering). The conversion is exact and suitable for automated workflows and reporting that require IEEE/IEC/ISO-consistent units."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the binary prefix definition standardized by international standards bodies (IEC/ISO) and referenced by U.S. standards guidance. Under this definition 1 mebibyte (1 MiB) equals 2^20 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes.",
      "For clarity and reproducibility we follow the conventions documented by national metrology organizations. This approach avoids ambiguity between binary prefixes (kibi-, mebi-, gibi-) and decimal SI-like prefixes (kilo-, mega-, giga-) which are sometimes used inconsistently in marketing and consumer contexts."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core formula (exact): MiB = bytes ÷ 1,048,576",
      "Equivalently: 1 MiB = 2^20 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes",
      "For programmatic use: divide the byte count by pow(2,20) or by 1048576.0 to produce a floating-point MiB value; round or format as required for display."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,048,576 bytes → 1 MiB (exact)",
      "5,000,000 bytes → 4.76837158203125 MiB (approximate; shows fractional MiB)",
      "536,870,912 bytes → 512 MiB (exact because 536,870,912 = 512 × 2^20)"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between bytes and MiB?",
        "answer": "1 MiB = 2^20 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes. Convert by dividing the byte count by 1,048,576."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is MiB different from MB (megabyte)?",
        "answer": "MiB (mebibyte) uses binary powers (base 2) and equals 1,048,576 bytes. MB (megabyte) conventionally uses decimal powers (base 10) and commonly equals 1,000,000 bytes. Use MiB when you need unambiguous binary units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Choose rounding based on context: for technical accuracy show at least 6 significant digits for fractional MiB, or round to 2–3 decimal places for user-facing displays. For exact storage accounting, keep integer byte counts and use MiB for aggregate reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why should I prefer binary prefixes in technical documents?",
        "answer": "Standards bodies (IEC/ISO) and national metrology institutes recommend binary prefixes (KiB, MiB, GiB) when the base-2 meaning is intended. This prevents ambiguity and aligns with measurements reported by many operating systems and engineering tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does my operating system report sizes in MiB or MB?",
        "answer": "It varies: some systems and tools display sizes using decimal prefixes (MB = 1,000,000 bytes) while others use binary-based displays but label them differently. Check the OS/tool documentation. For reproducible results, always inspect whether the tool uses base-2 or base-10 units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion appropriate for billing or regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "Use the unit convention specified by the contract or regulation. When no convention is specified, prefer the unambiguous binary prefix (MiB) for technical reporting; document the unit and conversion method. Consult applicable regulatory guidance or procurement documents for required conventions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I implement this conversion in code?",
        "answer": "Divide the byte count by 1048576.0 (which is 2^20) to obtain MiB as a floating-point value. For integer MiB values, perform integer division by 1,048,576."
