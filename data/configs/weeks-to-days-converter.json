    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms time measurements from weeks to days, enabling detailed project task estimation.",
      "Converting weeks to days helps with granular scheduling and daily task planning.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 week equals exactly 7 days."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 week = 7 days. To convert weeks to days, multiply by 7. For example, 1 week = 7 days, 4 weeks = 28 days.",
      "Daily task tracking provides detailed progress metrics for project management oversight.",
      "Understanding week-to-day conversion is essential for detailed task scheduling and planning.",
      "This converter provides precise time duration conversion for task-level planning."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – One week timeline: 1 week = 7 days.",
      "Example 2 – Monthly project: 4 weeks = 28 days.",
      "Example 3 – Quarter duration: 13 weeks = 91 days."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many days are in one week?",
        "answer": "1 week = 7 days (standard calendar week)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why convert weeks to days?",
        "answer": "Days provide granularity for task-level planning and daily progress tracking."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the formula for weeks to days?",
        "answer": "Days = Weeks × 7. Example: 3 weeks × 7 = 21 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I estimate task durations?",
        "answer": "Break projects into daily tasks, sum to total days, then group into weeks for planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about working days vs. calendar days?",
        "answer": "1 week = 7 calendar days or 5 business/working days (Monday-Friday)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does day duration affect project timeline?",
        "answer": "More concurrent tasks = fewer days needed; sequential tasks = more days required."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between effort and duration?",
        "answer": "Effort = person-hours needed; Duration = calendar days available (depends on team size)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I account for weekends?",
        "answer": "Use 5-day weeks for work weeks, 7-day weeks for calendar duration."
