1. This is a simple_calc because EBIT is computed from multiple input line items (revenues, cost of goods sold or operating expenses, and other operating income/expenses) and users must supply several related values to produce one primary output.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (optionally examples[], summary[], glossary[]).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, or other disallowed keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
