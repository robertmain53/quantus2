    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a length in feet into the equivalent length in inches using the exact mathematical relationship between the two customary units. It is intended for everyday measurement, construction planning, and engineering checks where the conversion factor is fixed and exact.",
      "Accuracy guidance and practical measurement advice are provided so you can choose appropriate rounding and understand measurement uncertainty. For formal compliance or legal metrology work, follow the referenced standards from national and international bodies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool uses the exact definition that 1 foot equals 12 inches and performs a deterministic multiplication of the input value in feet by 12 to produce inches. No empirical calibration is required for the arithmetic conversion itself.",
      "For measurement accuracy and traceability, consult national metrology guidance (NIST), international unit standards (ISO), instrumentation and measurement best practices (IEEE), and workplace measurement safety rules (OSHA). Where measurements come from physical instruments, account for instrument tolerance and calibration status before reporting converted results."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: inches = feet × 12",
      "To convert mixed measurements (feet + inches), first convert the feet portion: total_inches = (feet_value × 12) + inches_value",
      "For fractional feet (for example 6.25 ft), multiply directly: 6.25 × 12 = 75 inches"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5 ft → 5 × 12 = 60 in",
      "6.25 ft → 6.25 × 12 = 75 in",
      "5 ft 7 in → (5 × 12) + 7 = 67 in"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from feet to inches?",
        "answer": "The exact, defined conversion is 1 foot = 12 inches. This is an exact mathematical relationship used for all arithmetic conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Round according to your required precision. For construction drawings you might round to the nearest 1/16 in or 1/8 in. For engineering calculations use at least the number of decimal places required by your tolerance specification. Always document the rounding rule used."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert a measurement given as feet and inches (for example 5'7\")?",
        "answer": "Convert the feet to inches and add the remaining inches: total_inches = (feet × 12) + leftover_inches. For 5'7\", total_inches = (5 × 12) + 7 = 67 inches."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there accuracy or calibration concerns when using this converter?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic conversion is exact. Accuracy concerns arise from the source measurement instrument (tape, ruler, laser). For traceable measurements follow calibration and uncertainty guidance from recognized standards bodies (see citations). Record instrument tolerance and calibration interval when required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this converter handle very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Yes, the mathematical conversion scales linearly. For extremely large values check the host environment for numeric limits and rounding behavior. For typical use (construction, household, engineering) numeric range is not a practical concern."
