      "This calculator helps you compare standard monthly payments, monthly payments with recurring extra contributions, and biweekly payment strategies for a boat loan. Use it to estimate how extra payments reduce interest and shorten the loan.",
      "Enter the loan amount, APR, and term, then add recurring extras (if any). Results show payment amounts, estimated payoff time, total interest, and total paid for each scenario."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard amortization formulas for fixed-rate installment loans. For recurring extra payments the solver computes the number of payments required when the periodic payment is increased and interest accrues at the stated periodic rate.",
      "Biweekly calculations assume 26 payments per year (every two weeks). Where formulas require solving for the number of periods we use the closed-form logarithmic solution for an annuity given a fixed periodic payment.",

      "Periodic rate = APR / 100 / periods_per_year (monthly: 12, biweekly: 26).",
      "Scheduled payment = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-N)) where P is principal, r is periodic rate, N is total scheduled periods.",
      "When recurring extra is applied, total periodic payment = scheduled payment + extra. Number of periods to payoff is solved by: n = ceil( log(payment_total / (payment_total - P * r)) / log(1 + r) ).",

      "Example 1: $30,000 loan, 6.5% APR, 10 years. Standard monthly payment is calculated and shown along with total interest over 10 years.",
      "Example 2: Same loan with $100 extra monthly shows a reduced payoff time and lower total interest. Compare to a biweekly plan with equivalent extra per biweekly payment to see accelerated payoff."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Will this exact schedule match my lender's amortization table?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. Lenders may use different day-count conventions, rounding, payment application order, and may charge fees. Use this calculator for estimates and planning; confirm exact payoff amounts with your servicer before making large prepayments."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my extra payment is less than the interest due for a period?",
        "answer": "If the added amount does not cover the accrued interest for a period the principal will not decrease and payoff may not advance as expected. The formulas assume periodic payment_total exceeds the interest portion; the tool flags unrealistic inputs in practice and the methodology section explains this limit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are biweekly payments always better?",
        "answer": "Biweekly schedules can shorten payoff because 26 biweekly payments are equivalent to 13 monthly payments per year. Benefits depend on timing and how the lender posts payments. Always verify with your lender whether biweekly payments reduce principal immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these calculations?",
        "answer": "Calculations follow standard financial formulas and closed-form solutions for annuities. They are accurate within the assumptions stated (fixed rate, constant periodic payments, regular posting). See citations for authoritative standards and read the accuracy caveats before relying on results for legal or financial decisions."
