1. This is a converter because it converts between two area units (square meters ↔ square feet) that have a fixed mathematical relationship, requires a single numeric input, and returns a single numeric output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, meta, schema_org, form for converters, UI/layout/styling fields, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
