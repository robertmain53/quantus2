    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single numeric value from kilopascals (kPa) to pounds per square inch (psi). The relationship is a fixed physical constant and the tool provides clear, traceable results for engineering, laboratory, and field use.",
      "Use this tool for quick conversions, documentation of measurement reports, or when specifying pressure setpoints. For safety-critical or regulatory applications, follow calibration and uncertainty procedures described below and reference applicable standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally accepted exact relationship between the pascal and the pound-force per square inch. The calculator applies the standard constant so results are deterministic and repeatable.",
      "When reporting converted values for compliance, include the rounding precision and an estimate of measurement uncertainty. For instrumentation and calibration guidance consult NIST and ISO standards listed in the citations. OSHA guidance covers safety and pressure-vessel regulations where applicable."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: psi = kPa / 6.894757293168",
      "Equivalent multiplier: psi = kPa × 0.14503773773020923",
      "Calculation steps: 1) Enter pressure in kPa. 2) Multiply by 0.14503773773020923 or divide by 6.894757293168. 3) Round to the number of significant digits required by your report or instrument."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Standard atmosphere: 101.325 kPa → 101.325 / 6.894757293168 = 14.6959488 psi (report as 14.696 psi for 6 significant digits).",
      "Tire inflation example: 220 kPa → 220 × 0.14503773773 = 31.908301 psi (report as 31.91 psi for 4 significant digits).",
      "Low pressure example: 10 kPa → 10 / 6.894757293168 = 1.450377377 psi (report as 1.450 psi if three decimals are needed)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion for absolute or gauge pressure?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion applies to any pressure value expressed in kPa. Whether that kPa value is absolute or gauge depends on how the measurement was taken. Label converted results as 'kPa (gauge)' or 'kPa (abs)' as appropriate before converting to psi."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places based on the measurement instrument's resolution and required uncertainty. For safety-critical controls or regulatory reporting follow your organization or industry standard (often 2–3 significant figures for field gauges, more for laboratory instruments). Always state the rounding and uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion constant?",
        "answer": "The conversion uses the exact SI-derived relationship between pascals and pounds per square inch; the numeric constant shown is sufficient for practically all engineering and commercial uses. For metrology-grade work include instrument uncertainty and calibration traceability per NIST/ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate my pressure gauge before converting readings?",
        "answer": "Yes. Calibrate pressure instruments regularly against a traceable standard. Conversion does not remove instrument bias or drift. Follow calibration intervals and procedures per ISO 17025, NIST traceability recommendations, and any applicable OSHA requirements for safety equipment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory concerns when converting units for compliance documents?",
        "answer": "Regulators may require both the original measurement unit and the converted unit, plus stated uncertainty and calibration traceability. Always check applicable standards and include references to calibration certificates when submitting reports."
