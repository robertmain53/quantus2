      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms raw bits per second to megabits per second, the standard internet speed unit.",
        "Internet speeds are universally quoted in Mbps; converting from bps reveals underlying data rates.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 1 megabit per second equals 1 million bits per second."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps. To convert bps to Mbps, divide by 1,000,000.",
        "Internet speeds range from kilobits (dial-up) to gigabits (fiber) per second.",
        "Understanding bps to Mbps conversion is essential for internet connection evaluation.",
        "This converter provides precise data rate conversion for speed comparison."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Dial-up: 56,000 bps = 0.056 Mbps.",
        "Example 2 – Broadband: 100,000,000 bps = 100 Mbps.",
        "Example 3 – Fast fiber: 1,000,000,000 bps = 1,000 Mbps = 1 Gbps."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What's typical home internet speed?",
          "answer": "20-100 Mbps for cable/DSL. 300-1,000 Mbps for fiber. 5-50 Mbps for mobile 4G."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need fast internet?",
          "answer": "5 Mbps minimum (streaming). 25 Mbps recommended. 100+ Mbps for multiple users/4K video."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is my current speed?",
          "answer": "Run speed test at Speedtest.net. Report both download and upload speeds in Mbps."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is advertised speed different from actual?",
          "answer": "Advertising shows maximum. Actual depends on congestion, distance, equipment. Usually 50-70% of advertised."
        },
        {
          "question": "What affects download speed?",
          "answer": "Distance from infrastructure, network congestion, equipment quality, service tier, interference."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is upload speed important?",
          "answer": "Yes if video conferencing or uploading. Typically 10-20% of download speed."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much data can I download?",
          "answer": "Data = Speed × Time. 100 Mbps = 12.5 MB/s. Can download 45 GB/hour."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I upgrade my internet?",
          "answer": "If below 25 Mbps with multiple users. If only email/browsing, 10 Mbps sufficient."
