    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a data transfer rate expressed in bits per second (bps) to megabits per second (Mbps). It uses the SI (decimal) definition of megabit where 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits per second unless you explicitly need the binary (mebibit) alternative.",
      "The page explains the exact formula used, highlights the difference between bits and bytes, and notes when to use the binary mebibit value (Mibit) or convert to megabytes per second (MB/s) for file-transfer contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on fixed unit relationships defined by international standards for SI prefixes. For decimal megabits (commonly used in networking and ISP speed reporting) 1 megabit = 1,000,000 bits.",
      "When presenting results the converter uses the decimal factor by default because network speeds and most bandwidth measurements use SI prefixes; the interface also documents the binary alternative (mebibit, 2^20 = 1,048,576) for contexts that require it.",
      "Practical notes: networking equipment, speed tests, and regulatory reports frequently report decimal Mbps. When converting to megabytes per second, divide bits by 8 to get bytes and then apply the megabyte factor (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes for decimal MB)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary (decimal megabit): Mbps = bps ÷ 1,000,000",
      "Binary alternative (mebibit): Mibit/s = bps ÷ 1,048,576",
      "To convert to megabytes per second (decimal): MB/s = bps ÷ 8,000,000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 5000000 bps → 5 Mbps (5000000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 5)",
      "Example 2 (binary context): 5242880 bps → 5 Mibit/s (5242880 ÷ 1,048,576 = 5)",
      "Example 3 (bytes): 10000000 bps → 1.25 MB/s (10000000 ÷ 8,000,000 = 1.25)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between bps and Mbps?",
        "answer": "Using the SI (decimal) megabit: 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits per second, so divide bps by 1,000,000 to get Mbps. For binary-prefixed mebibits use 1 Mibit = 1,048,576 bits."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use mebibits (Mibit) instead of megabits (Mbps)?",
        "answer": "Mebibit (binary) units are used in computing contexts that rely on powers of two (for example memory or some low-level data structures). Networking, ISPs, and most speed-test tools report decimal Mbps. Follow the measurement convention used by your instrument or report."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert bits per second to megabytes per second?",
        "answer": "First convert bits to bytes by dividing by 8, then apply the megabyte factor. For decimal MB: MB/s = bps ÷ 8,000,000. For binary MiB: MiB/s = bps ÷ 8,388,608."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there accuracy or instrument limits I should watch for?",
        "answer": "Yes. Measurement hardware, sampling windows, and protocol overhead (headers, retransmissions) affect observed throughput. For regulated measurements consult published measurement procedures; repeated measures and averaging reduce variance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do regulatory agencies specify how to report broadband speeds?",
        "answer": "Regulatory agencies publish guidance and reports that clarify how speeds are measured and reported. Use their recommended measurement practices when preparing formal reports or compliance documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might a file download show a different value than my network speed test?",
        "answer": "File-transfer rates are reported in bytes per second and are affected by disk I/O, protocol overhead, server capacity, and application-layer buffering. Convert units appropriately (1 byte = 8 bits) and account for overhead when comparing numbers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for reporting?",
        "answer": "Round to a precision appropriate for the context. For human-readable reports 2 significant digits (e.g., 12.3 Mbps) are common; regulatory or laboratory reports may require stated uncertainty and statistical methods for averaging."
