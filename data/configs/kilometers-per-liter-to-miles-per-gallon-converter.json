    "introduction": [
      "Convert kilometers per liter (km/L) to miles per gallon (MPG) quickly and accurately. This converter uses internationally recognized unit definitions so results are consistent with government and laboratory references.",
      "Be aware there are two common MPG definitions: US (gallon = 3.785411784 L) and Imperial (gallon = 4.54609 L). By default this tool presents the widely used US gallon conversion; the methodology section shows the alternative Imperial formula and factors."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This conversion is a fixed-ratio unit conversion built from base definitions: 1 kilometer = 0.62137119223733 miles and 1 litre = 0.26417205235815 US gallons. The numeric conversion factor is therefore derived by combining those exact unit definitions.",
      "Values and constants referenced follow NIST and federal guidance for unit definitions and fuel-economy reporting. For regulatory context on how MPG numbers are produced and rounded, see government fuel-economy resources listed in the citations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "US MPG (common default): mpg_us = km_per_liter × (miles per km) / (gallons per litre) = km/L × 0.62137119223733 ÷ 0.26417205235815 ≈ km/L × 2.352145833",
      "Imperial MPG (UK gallon): mpg_imp = km_per_liter × 0.62137119223733 × 4.54609 ≈ km/L × 2.824809",
      "Rounding guidance: present results with two decimal places for consumer-facing displays (for example 15.00 km/L → 35.28 mpg (US)). Use additional digits for engineering or regulatory reporting where required."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example (US MPG): 15.00 km/L × 2.352145833 ≈ 35.28 mpg (US).",
      "Example (Imperial MPG): 15.00 km/L × 2.824809 ≈ 42.37 mpg (Imperial).",
      "Quick check: 1.00 km/L ≈ 2.35215 mpg (US); 1.00 km/L ≈ 2.82481 mpg (Imperial)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which MPG does this converter return by default — US or Imperial?",
        "answer": "The default conversion shown uses the US gallon definition (1 US gallon = 3.785411784 litres). The methodology section includes the Imperial-gallon formula and factor if you need the UK/Imperial value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the conversion constants exact?",
        "answer": "The unit definitions (1 km = 0.62137119223733 miles; 1 litre = 0.26417205235815 US gallons) are the internationally accepted values used by standard bodies such as NIST. Results are mathematically exact given those definitions; displayed rounding is a presentation choice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do MPG numbers from my car differ from this conversion?",
        "answer": "Onboard trip computers and lab-rated MPG are influenced by measurement method, driving cycle, and rounding rules. Fuel economy labels (EPA, WLTP, etc.) use standardized test procedures; real-world fuel consumption also depends on temperature, driving behavior, load, and instrument calibration."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I measure to get an accurate km/L reading before converting?",
        "answer": "Use a full-tank method: record odometer distance driven between fill-ups and measure fuel added (volume) at the same filling temperature/location if possible. Use calibrated pumps and account for fuel temperature if high precision is required. For regulatory-grade accuracy, follow procedures from vehicle testing authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I trust in the converted value?",
        "answer": "For everyday use, two decimal places are appropriate. For engineering, lab, or regulatory use, maintain the precision consistent with your input measurement and follow the significant-figure rules from metrology guides such as NIST publications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do temperature and fuel density affect conversions?",
        "answer": "This unit conversion maps volume-to-volume and length-to-length and does not account for fuel density or mass. If you need mass-based energy efficiency (e.g., MJ/kg), include fuel density and energy content in your calculation. For volume corrections by temperature, consult standards used by petroleum testing laboratories."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do the rounding and display rules come from?",
        "answer": "Consumer-facing rounding typically follows regulatory or industry practice (for example, EPA label conventions). For technical reporting, use the number of digits justified by measurement uncertainty and follow guidance from metrology references."
