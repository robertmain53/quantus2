      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms gradians to familiar degrees for angle interpretation.",
        "European surveyors may use gradians; converting to degrees enables worldwide communication.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 100 gradians equals 90 degrees."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "90° = 100 grad. To convert gradians to degrees, multiply by 0.9 (or 9/10).",
        "Gradians offer decimal precision but degrees remain universally recognized.",
        "Understanding gradian-to-degree conversion is useful for international surveying work.",
        "This converter provides precise angle conversion for surveying communication."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Right angle: 100 grad = 90°.",
        "Example 2 – Full circle: 400 grad = 360°.",

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How do I convert gradians to degrees?",
          "answer": "Degrees = Gradians × 0.9. Example: 100 grad × 0.9 = 90°."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the conversion 1 grad = 0.9°?",
          "answer": "Yes. 1 grad = 0.9° exactly. So multiply gradians by 0.9 for degrees."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why use gradians at all?",
          "answer": "400-part circle is decimal-friendly. 100 grad per quadrant. Useful for calculations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are gradians used in modern surveying?",
          "answer": "Declining. Degrees remain most common. Some European instruments still use gradians."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's a decimal minute in gradians?",
          "answer": "Gradians often given as decimals (50.25 grad). No subdivisions like degree minutes/seconds."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use gradians with a standard protractor?",
          "answer": "Most protractors show degrees. Gradian protractors exist but are uncommon."

        {
          "question": "How do mils relate to gradians?",
          "answer": "Military mils: 6,400 per circle. Gradians: 400 per circle. Both offer precision vs degrees."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I learn gradians?",
          "answer": "Only if you work in European surveying. Otherwise, focus on degrees and radians."
