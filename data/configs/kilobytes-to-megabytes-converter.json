    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms data measurements from Kilobytes to Megabytes, enabling practical storage capacity understanding.",
      "Modern data storage scales from kilobytes to gigabytes and terabytes. Understanding conversions helps interpret file and disk sizes.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 megabyte equals exactly 1,000 kilobytes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MB = 1,000 KB. To convert kilobytes to megabytes, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 KB = 1 MB, 5,000 KB = 5 MB.",
      "File sizes on computers are displayed in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes depending on size. Understanding the hierarchy helps manage storage.",
      "Cloud storage quotas are often expressed in gigabytes while individual file sizes are in megabytes or kilobytes.",
      "This converter provides precise data size conversions for digital storage management."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Documents: A text document might be 50 KB, while a PDF could be 2-5 MB.",
      "Example 2 – Photos: A smartphone photo is typically 3-5 MB, a batch of 100 photos = 300-500 MB.",
      "Example 3 – Videos: A short video clip might be 50-100 MB, while a full movie is several gigabytes."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Kilobytes to Megabytes?",
        "answer": "1 MB = 1,000 KB. Divide kilobytes by 1,000 to get megabytes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are there different units for data storage?",
        "answer": "Storage scales range from bytes to petabytes. Using different units keeps file sizes readable and comparable."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many megabytes of data can I store?",
        "answer": "1 GB = 1,000 MB. A 1 TB drive holds 1,000 GB = 1,000,000 MB of data."
