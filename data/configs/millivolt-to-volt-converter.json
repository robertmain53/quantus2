    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms millivolt-scale voltage measurements to standard Volts, enabling sensor data integration and signal level interpretation. It is designed for electronics engineers, sensor technicians, and data acquisition specialists.",
      "Millivolts are commonly used in sensors and analog circuits, while Volts are the standard unit for reporting. Converting between them is essential for system integration.",
      "This converter uses the exact relationship where 1 Volt equals 1,000 Millivolts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 Volt = 1,000 Millivolts. To convert mV to V, divide by 1,000. For example, 500 mV = 0.5 V, 100 mV = 0.1 V, 1 mV = 0.001 V.",
      "Sensor outputs typically use mV while system specifications use V. Accurate conversion ensures proper signal conditioning and ADC programming.",
      "Precision measurement systems must maintain unit consistency throughout signal processing to avoid calculation errors.",
      "This converter provides precise voltage conversions for sensor interface design and signal conditioning system development."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Thermocouple: A 50 mV thermocouple output converts to 0.05 V for amplifier input specification.",
      "Example 2 – Sensor bridge: A 100 mV sensor output converts to 0.1 V for ADC configuration.",
      "Example 3 – Strain gauge: A 2 mV output converts to 0.002 V, requiring precision amplification.",
      "Example 4 – pH sensor: A 100 mV range converts to 0.1 V for pH calculation."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from mV to V?",
        "answer": "1 V = 1,000 mV. Divide mV by 1,000 to get V."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use mV in electronics?",
        "answer": "Sensor outputs and small signals are naturally in millivolts. Using mV avoids decimal Volts in design documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I configure an ADC for millivolt signals?",
        "answer": "Use 0-100 mV range on a 10 V input with 100:1 divider, or directly measure with 0-100 mV ADC range if available. This improves resolution."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the noise floor for millivolt measurements?",
        "answer": "Good systems achieve microvolts of noise. For mV measurements, expect 10 microvolts to 100 microvolts noise depending on configuration."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I amplify millivolt signals?",
        "answer": "Use precision op-amp gain circuits. Gain = (Output Range) / (Input Range). For 0-100 mV input to 0-5 V output, Gain = 50."
      },
      {
        "question": "What causes measurement errors?",
        "answer": "Noise, offset errors, temperature drift, and improper grounding. High-quality measurement systems address all these sources systematically."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is millivolt measurement used in medical devices?",
        "answer": "ECG, EEG, and other biomedical signals are millivolt-scale. Precise amplification and filtering convert these to measurement signals."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a precision voltage source?",
        "answer": "A calibrated source providing known millivolt levels for testing and verification. Essential for validating measurement systems and ADC accuracy."
