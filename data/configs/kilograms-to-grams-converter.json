    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms kilograms to grams for precise weight specification.",
      "Large weights in kilograms convert to grams for detailed measurement.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 kilogram equals 1,000 grams."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 kg = 1,000 g. To convert kilograms to grams, multiply by 1,000.",
      "Grams provide finer resolution than kilograms for accuracy.",
      "Understanding kilogram-to-gram conversion is essential for precision weighing.",
      "This converter provides accurate weight conversion."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – 1 kg = 1,000 grams.",
      "Example 2 – 2.5 kg = 2,500 grams.",
      "Example 3 – 0.5 kg = 500 grams."

      {
        "question": "When do I use grams vs kilograms?",
        "answer": "Grams: small quantities, recipes, nutrition. Kilograms: large weights, shipping."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many grams in a pound?",
        "answer": "1 pound ≈ 453.6 grams. 1 kg ≈ 2.2 pounds."
      },
      {
        "question": "What weighs 1 kilogram?",
        "answer": "Liter of water. Small bag of flour. Standard weights for scales."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are kitchen scales in grams or kilograms?",
        "answer": "Usually both. Grams for recipes (0-500g). Kilograms for larger items."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between mass and weight?",
        "answer": "Mass: amount of matter (kg, g). Weight: force of gravity (Newtons, pounds-force)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do scales measure mass or weight?",
        "answer": "Technically weight. But calibrated for Earth gravity. Results called 'weight' colloquially."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert grams to volume?",
        "answer": "Not directly. Grams=mass. Milliliters=volume. Relationship depends on density."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a metric ton?",
        "answer": "1 metric ton = 1,000 kg = 1,000,000 grams. Used for very large weights."
