    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a mass value expressed in kilograms (kg) to grams (g) using the International System of Units (SI) relationship: 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams. Use this for quick unit changes, recipe scaling, laboratory notes, shipping calculations, and educational purposes.",
      "The tool returns the mathematical conversion only. When the value originates from a physical measurement, consider instrument accuracy, calibration, and environmental factors that affect the measured mass. See methodology and FAQs for guidance on precision, calibration, and applicable standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the fixed metric relation defined by the SI system: 1 kg = 1000 g. This is an exact defined ratio and does not vary with context.",
      "When converting measured masses rather than nominal values, follow metrology best practices. Use calibrated instruments traceable to national standards, document measurement uncertainty, and apply appropriate rounding rules consistent with the intended use and regulatory requirements.",
      "Relevant standards and authorities include the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) for SI definitions, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for U.S. measurement traceability and guidance, and ISO standards for laboratory and quality management where applicable."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply the kilogram value by 1000 to get grams.",
      "Formula: grams = kilograms × 1000",
      "Example step: 2.35 kg × 1000 = 2350 g"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 kilogram = 1000 grams",
      "0.5 kilogram = 500 grams",
      "2.35 kilograms = 2350 grams",
      "0.001 kilogram = 1 gram"

        "definition": "Property of a measurement result that can be related to appropriate standards, usually national or international standards, through an unbroken chain of calibrations."
      },
      {
        "term": "Measurement uncertainty",
        "definition": "A parameter characterizing the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand; report when conversions are from measured data."
      }
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The metric relationship used here is exact: 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams. The arithmetic conversion is therefore exact; any uncertainty arises from source measurements or rounding choices, not the conversion factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round converted values?",
        "answer": "Round based on the precision of the original measurement or the needs of your application. For laboratory or regulated work, follow documented rounding rules in your quality system or relevant standards. When unsure, preserve at least the same number of significant digits as the input measurement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for weighing instrument error?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a mathematical unit conversion only. If your input is from a balance or scale, account separately for instrument calibration, linearity, drift, and measurement uncertainty before reporting final values."
      },
      {
        "question": "When do I need traceable calibration?",
        "answer": "Traceable calibration is required when measurements are used for regulatory compliance, legal-for-trade transactions, clinical dosing, or any context where documented accuracy is mandatory. Follow national metrology institute guidance and ISO standards for calibration intervals and procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is mass the same as weight?",
        "answer": "Not strictly. Mass is an intrinsic property measured in kilograms or grams. Weight is the force due to gravity on a mass and is measured in newtons. In everyday contexts on Earth, people often use 'weight' to mean mass; ensure correct terminology for technical or legal purposes."
