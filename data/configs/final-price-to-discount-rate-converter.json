    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a final (sale) price back into the discount amount and discount rate relative to the original (list) price. Enter the original price and the final price to get the absolute savings and the discount expressed both as a percent and as a decimal fraction.",
      "Results are calculated using straightforward arithmetic widely used in retail and financial reporting. See the methodology and accuracy notes below for guidance on rounding and when a result represents a markdown versus a price increase."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator computes discount amount as the difference between original price and final price. The discount rate is the discount amount divided by the original price.",
      "For numerical stability and predictable rounding, use cents-level inputs (two decimal places) for currency. Follow your organization's accounting rounding rules when recording results for reporting or taxation purposes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Discount amount = original_price - final_price",
      "Discount rate (decimal) = (original_price - final_price) / original_price",
      "Discount rate (%) = Discount rate (decimal) x 100"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Original price 100.00, final price 75.00 → discount amount 25.00, discount rate 25%",
      "Example 2: Original price 49.99, final price 44.99 → discount amount 5.00, discount rate ≈10.002% (rounded per reporting rules)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What if final price is greater than the original price?",
        "answer": "If final price is bigger than the original price the formula returns a negative discount (interpreted as a markup). The same formulas apply; a negative percent indicates an increase rather than a reduction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the original price is zero?",
        "answer": "Division by zero is undefined. This tool requires a positive original (list) price. Enter an original price greater than zero to compute a discount rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for financial reports?",
        "answer": "Round according to your applicable accounting or regulatory rules. For display, percentages are commonly rounded to two decimal places; for legal or tax reporting, follow the standards or policies that govern your reporting jurisdiction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are results exact?",
        "answer": "Results reflect exact arithmetic on the provided inputs, subject to typical floating-point representation. Very large or very small inputs can be affected by numerical precision; follow the accuracy caveats and validation checks below."
