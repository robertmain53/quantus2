    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass value entered in kilograms (kg) to milligrams (mg) using the exact SI relationship between the units. It is intended for quick, deterministic unit conversions and for use alongside calibrated measurement equipment.",
      "Conversions are exact mathematically (1 kilogram equals 1,000,000 milligrams) but reported results should reflect the precision of the measurement instrument and any applicable regulatory or workplace requirements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the International System of Units (SI) prefixes and definitions. The conversion is a fixed scaling factor based on the SI prefix 'milli' (10^-3). Converting from a larger SI base unit to a smaller SI subunit multiplies by powers of ten.",
      "For display and downstream use, consider the accuracy and calibration of your weighing device. When documenting or labelling values for compliance, follow relevant standards for measurement uncertainty and rounding."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Exact relationship: 1 kilogram = 1,000,000 milligrams.",
      "Calculation step: multiply the value in kilograms by 1,000,000 to obtain milligrams.",
      "Practical note: apply appropriate rounding based on the instrument's significant figures or the number of decimal places required by your procedure or regulation."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.0025 kg → 0.0025 × 1,000,000 = 2,500 mg",
      "1 kg → 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 mg",
      "0 kg → 0 mg",
      "-0.5 kg (mathematical result) → -500,000 mg. Negative mass is not physically meaningful; negative values arise from calculations or signed corrections."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Multiply kilograms by 1,000,000 to get milligrams. Report results with precision that matches your measurement capability and documentation requirements.",
      "Follow standards for measurement uncertainty, device calibration, and numeric representation when using converted values for compliance, reporting, or safety."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from kilograms to milligrams?",
        "answer": "Exactly 1 kilogram equals 1,000,000 milligrams. The conversion is a fixed power-of-ten scale based on SI prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Round according to the precision of the original measurement or the requirement in your procedure. Do not add spurious precision beyond the measuring instrument's uncertainty. For numerical processing, consider IEEE 754 floating-point limits for very large or small values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative kilograms to milligrams?",
        "answer": "Mathematically yes (the sign is preserved), but negative mass is not physically meaningful. Negative values typically indicate corrections, offsets, or data-entry errors and should be verified."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits where conversion may lose accuracy?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact, but computer representation can introduce rounding when values are very large or when using limited-precision types. For critical applications, use appropriate numeric formats and validate against device calibration certificates."
      },
      {
        "question": "What measurement standards should I follow when reporting converted masses?",
        "answer": "Follow recognised standards for units and measurement practice, such as SI guidance and weighing device regulations. Also apply your industry or laboratory protocols for uncertainty, traceability, and calibration."
