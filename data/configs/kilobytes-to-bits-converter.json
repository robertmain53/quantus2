    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms kilobyte storage measurements to bits for network transfer analysis.",
      "Calculating download times requires converting storage (KB) to transfer rate (bits per second).",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 kilobyte equals exactly 8,000 bits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 KB = 8,000 bits. To convert kilobytes to bits, multiply by 8,000.",
      "Network calculations require expressing file sizes in bits to match bps transfer rates.",
      "Understanding KB to bits conversion enables accurate transfer time estimation.",
      "This converter provides precise data size conversion for network planning."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Small document: 10 KB = 80,000 bits.",
      "Example 2 – Web page: 100 KB = 800,000 bits.",
      "Example 3 – Song sample: 500 KB = 4,000,000 bits."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate download time?",
        "answer": "Time = File Size (bits) ÷ Speed (bps). Example: 800,000 bits ÷ 1 Mbps = 0.8 seconds."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many bits in a GB?",
        "answer": "1 GB = 1,000 MB = 1,000,000 KB = 8,000,000,000 bits = 8 Gb."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why express storage in bytes but transfer in bits?",
        "answer": "Bytes for storage (human scale). Bits for transfer rate (technical specification)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a fast download speed?",
        "answer": "50 Mbps acceptable. 100+ Mbps good. 500 Mbps+ excellent for modern use."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long to transfer 1 TB at 100 Mbps?",
        "answer": "1 TB = 8,000 Gb = 8,000 Mbps. Time = 8,000 ÷ 100 = 80 seconds ≈ 1.3 minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does compression affect transfer time?",
        "answer": "Yes. Compressed file smaller (fewer bits). Transfer faster but requires compression time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a realistic transfer speed?",
        "answer": "Advertised 100 Mbps usually yields 70-90 Mbps actual due to overhead."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I switch to fiber?",
        "answer": "If available and affordable: yes. Fiber faster, more reliable than cable/DSL."
