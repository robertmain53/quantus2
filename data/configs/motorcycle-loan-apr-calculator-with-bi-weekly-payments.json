      "This calculator compares monthly, bi-weekly (26 payments/year), and accelerated bi-weekly payment schedules for a motorcycle loan. Enter the vehicle price, down payment, fees included in the loan, APR, and term to see payment amounts and estimated totals.",
      "Results are illustrative. Use them to compare schedules and to verify lender disclosures. Always compare the lender’s Truth-in-Lending APR disclosure; small rounding and timing differences can change totals."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard amortizing-loan formulae applied per payment period: payment = principal * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)), where r is the periodic rate and n is number of periods.",
      "Bi-weekly schedules split the year into 26 payment periods. Accelerated bi-weekly commonly pays half of the monthly payment every two weeks; this tool computes the implied half-month payment and multiplies by 26 periods to approximate the accelerated schedule effect.",
      "Effective annual rate computations use compound interest formula: (1 + periodic_rate)^(periods_per_year) - 1 to show the impact of compounding frequency."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Principal = loan_amount - down_payment + fees.",
      "Monthly periodic rate = APR / 12. Number of monthly payments = term_years * 12. Monthly payment uses amortization formula.",
      "Bi-weekly periodic rate = APR / 26. Number of bi-weekly payments = term_years * 26. Bi-weekly payment uses the same amortization formula with periodic rate and periods.",
      "Accelerated bi-weekly payment (approximate) = monthly_payment / 2. Total and interest shown for accelerated schedule are approximate since exact interest savings depend on payment timing and lender posting rules."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does a bi-weekly schedule always save interest?",
        "answer": "Paying more frequently typically reduces outstanding principal sooner and can reduce interest, but the exact savings depend on whether payments are timed as true half-month payments, the lender’s posting rules, and whether the lender offers an accelerated plan that applies extra payments to principal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the calculator APR the same as the lender’s APR?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the APR you enter as the stated annual rate. It does not re-calculate lender disclosures (such as fees amortized into APR). Always rely on the lender’s Truth-in-Lending disclosure for the official APR."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the accelerated bi-weekly approximations?",
        "answer": "Accelerated bi-weekly results are approximate because some lenders implement accelerated plans differently (e.g., applying one extra monthly payment per year, or posting payments at different times). Use this as a planning estimate and confirm with your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I verify with my lender?",
        "answer": "Confirm payment posting rules, whether extra payments are applied to principal, whether there are prepayment penalties, and the lender’s method for quoting APR and compounding."
