    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct SI unit conversion from kilopascals (kPa) to megapascals (MPa). The relationship is fixed and exact within the arithmetic of real numbers: 1 kPa equals 0.001 MPa.",
      "The tool is intended for quick numeric conversion and documentation. For measurements used in engineering designs, calibration records, or regulatory reports, verify instrument calibration, range limits, and measurement uncertainty before reporting converted values."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) base Pascal (Pa) where 1 MPa = 1,000,000 Pa and 1 kPa = 1,000 Pa, yielding the precise ratio 1 kPa = 0.001 MPa.",
      "When converting measured pressures, treat the numerical conversion separately from measurement uncertainty. Calibration and traceability to national standards are recommended for measurements cited in technical or regulatory contexts; refer to NIST guidance and ISO/IEC 17025 for calibration and laboratory competence.",
      "For safety-critical applications, confirm sensor operating range and safety margins defined by applicable standards and regulations before applying converted values to design or compliance checks."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with the value in kilopascals (kPa).",
      "Step 2: Multiply the kPa value by 0.001 to get megapascals (MPa).",
      "Formula: MPa = kPa × 0.001",
      "Equivalently: MPa = kPa ÷ 1000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "101.325 kPa → 101.325 × 0.001 = 0.101325 MPa (standard atmospheric pressure at sea level).",
      "1000 kPa → 1000 × 0.001 = 1 MPa.",
      "2500 kPa → 2500 × 0.001 = 2.5 MPa.",
      "0 kPa → 0 MPa."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion factor 0.001 is exact for converting kPa to MPa. Any approximation arises only from numeric rounding when displaying results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report for engineering documents?",
        "answer": "Report decimals consistent with the measurement uncertainty and the significant figures of the instrument. Do not imply greater precision than the calibrated instrument provides. For example, if sensor uncertainty is ±0.1 kPa, convert and round so reported significant figures reflect that uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate instruments before converting?",
        "answer": "Calibration is not required to perform a numeric unit conversion, but it is required to ensure the accuracy of measured values used in safety, compliance, or design work. Follow traceable calibration procedures per ISO/IEC 17025 and national guidance such as NIST publications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert MPa back to kPa with the same tool?",
        "answer": "Yes. The inverse conversion is kPa = MPa × 1000. Use the reverse numeric operation for converting measurement values reported in MPa to kPa."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory limits or safety rules I should check when working with pressure values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Pressure equipment, vessel design, and workplace safety may be governed by regional and industry standards and regulations. Consult applicable OSHA guidance and the relevant engineering standards for minimum safety requirements and allowable working pressures."
