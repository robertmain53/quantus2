    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates data rates expressed in gigabits per second (Gbps) into kilobits per second (kbps) using SI (decimal) prefixes. It is intended for networking, reporting, and quick engineering checks.",
      "By default the tool follows the International System of Units (SI) convention where giga = 10^9 and kilo = 10^3. That means 1 Gbps equals 1,000,000 kbps under the decimal definition."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use SI (decimal) prefix definitions consistent with national metrology guidance: giga = 10^9 and kilo = 10^3. The conversion is therefore a fixed multiplier: 1 Gbps = (10^9 bits) / (10^3 bits) = 10^6 kbps.",
      "Networking and storage communities sometimes use binary prefixes (e.g., gibibit = 2^30 bits) or mix bits and bytes. When you need binary-prefixed conversions or conversions to bytes per second, use the appropriate unit (e.g., Gibibit/s or kB/s) and account for the 8 bits per byte factor."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) conversion used here: multiply the value in Gbps by 1,000,000 to obtain kbps.",
      "Formula (concise): kbps = Gbps × 10^6.",
      "To convert to kilobytes per second (kB/s) instead of kilobits per second, divide the resulting kbps by 8 (kB/s = kbps ÷ 8)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 Gbps → 1,000,000 kbps",
      "0.5 Gbps → 500,000 kbps",
      "10 Gbps → 10,000,000 kbps",
      "To get kilobytes per second: 1 Gbps → 1,000,000 kbps → 125,000 kB/s (divide by 8)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this converter use decimal (SI) or binary prefixes?",
        "answer": "This converter uses decimal SI prefixes by default (giga = 10^9, kilo = 10^3). Binary prefixes (gibi, kibi) follow powers of two (2^30, 2^10) and are distinct; use binary-prefixed units (Gib, Kib) when those are required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my measured throughput differ from the converted value?",
        "answer": "Measured throughput can be lower than nominal due to protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgements), encoding/serialization overhead, network contention, and measurement method. Instruments and software tools also report either bits or bytes and may round differently; always check units and measurement method."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert bits per second to bytes per second?",
        "answer": "Bits and bytes differ by a factor of 8. To convert kilobits per second to kilobytes per second divide by 8. Watch the capitalization: 'b' = bit, 'B' = byte."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which definition should I use for formal reporting or compliance?",
        "answer": "Follow the unit conventions specified by the regulating or reporting authority you are reporting to. For most technical and regulatory contexts, SI (decimal) prefixes are standard. Refer to national metrology and regulator guidance for formal requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "Round results to a precision appropriate for the use case. For network engineering two to three significant figures are often sufficient; for regulatory or lab-grade reporting follow the measurement uncertainty and rounding rules defined by your lab’s quality system or national metrology guidance."
