    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts area values from square feet (ft²) to hectares (ha) and vice versa using internationally accepted unit definitions. It is intended for quick conversions, planning, GIS checks, and preparing data for land records.",
      "The hectare (ha) is a metric unit equal to 10,000 square metres and is accepted for use with the International System of Units (SI). The square foot is derived from the international foot (1 ft = 0.3048 m) and therefore can be expressed exactly in square metres, enabling an exact conversion between ft² and ha.",
      "Use this tool for calculations and estimating area. For legally binding land measurements, cadastral surveys, or contractual tolerances, consult a licensed surveyor or the relevant local land registry."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We convert through the SI base unit (square metre). The international foot is defined exactly as 0.3048 metres, so 1 ft² = (0.3048 m)² = 0.09290304 m². One hectare is exactly 10,000 m².",
      "From those definitions you get an exact conversion factor between square feet and hectares. This approach follows measurement standards from national metrology institutes and the SI Bureau.",
      "Recommendations and practical notes reference authoritative sources for unit definitions, surveying practices, and GIS precision to help you apply conversions correctly in technical or legal contexts."

      "Conversion route: square feet → square metres → hectares.",
      "Key relationships: 1 ft = 0.3048 m (exact), 1 ft² = 0.09290304 m², 1 ha = 10,000 m².",
      "Formula (ft² to ha): hectares = square feet × 0.000009290304. Reverse (ha to ft²): square feet = hectares ÷ 0.000009290304."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from square feet to hectares?",
        "answer": "Using exact definitions, 1 square foot = 0.09290304 m² and 1 hectare = 10,000 m², so 1 ft² = 0.000009290304 ha. Multiply square feet by 0.000009290304 to get hectares."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the hectare an SI unit?",
        "answer": "The hectare is not a base SI unit but it is accepted for use with the International System of Units (SI). The SI brochure and national metrology institutes document this acceptance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use for land transactions or planning?",
        "answer": "Decimal precision depends on purpose and jurisdiction. For large-area planning two to four decimal places in hectares is common; cadastral or engineering surveys often require centimeter-level precision and will report more digits. Always follow local registry or survey standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for cadastral parcels, property deeds, or permitting?",
        "answer": "This tool provides accurate mathematical conversions, but legal or certified measurements require licensed surveyors, certified instruments, and adherence to local cadastral rules. Consult the local land registry or a licensed surveyor for legally binding figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does measurement instrument accuracy affect converted results?",
        "answer": "Instrument accuracy (e.g., consumer GPS, survey-grade GNSS, total station) determines the meaningful precision of any area measurement. Converting a value does not improve measurement error; report converted results with precision commensurate to the original measurement's uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why convert via square metres instead of using a single direct multiplier?",
        "answer": "Converting via square metres uses SI-consistent exact definitions (1 ft = 0.3048 m, 1 ha = 10,000 m²). That route ensures traceability to international standards and avoids ambiguity in unit definitions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does geodetic projection or map scale affect area conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. Flat-area conversions (ft² ↔ ha) assume the numeric area is already in consistent planar units. For geospatial work, ensure areas are computed in an appropriate projected coordinate system for the region to avoid distortion; then convert the numeric area between units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I check large-batch conversions for consistency?",
        "answer": "Use this exact conversion factor in automated processes and validate with spot checks. For critical datasets, perform independent checks using GIS software or reference calculators, and maintain provenance for input units and coordinate reference systems."
