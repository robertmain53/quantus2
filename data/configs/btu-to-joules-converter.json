This conversion bridges regional and global engineering practices.","This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 BTU equals approximately 1,055.06 Joules."],"methodology":["1 BTU = 1,055.06 J. To convert BTU to joules, multiply by 1,055.06. For example, 1 BTU = 1,055.06 J, 10 BTU = 10,550.6 J.","HVAC systems specify cooling capacity in BTU per hour (BTU/h), but engineering calculations often require joules per second (watts). Converting enables proper equipment selection.","Air conditioning and heating units across North America use BTU ratings. Converting to joules allows international comparison and standardization.","This converter provides precise energy conversions for HVAC, heating systems, and international engineering applications."],"examples":["Example 1 – Air conditioning: A 10,000 BTU/h AC unit delivers approximately 10,550.6 J/s (watts), useful for power consumption analysis.","Example 2 – Heating capacity: A furnace with 100,000 BTU/h output produces 105,506 J/s, essential for home heating design.","Example 3 – Energy efficiency: A boiler using 50,000 BTU converts to 52,753 J of thermal energy, needed for efficiency calculations."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from BTU to Joules?","answer":"1 BTU ≈ 1,055.06 J.
