      "This calculator estimates the monthly payment while a loan is on an interest-only schedule and the subsequent level payment if the loan is amortized after the interest-only period. Use it to compare payment scenarios and understand the interest cost of interest-only arrangements.",
      "The tool models standard monthly compounding and the common annuity formula for level amortizing payments. It allows choosing whether accrued interest is capitalized (added to principal) at the end of the interest-only period and adding optional extra monthly payments during amortization."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Interest-only payment is computed as principal times the periodic (monthly) interest rate. Periodic rate is calculated from the entered annual rate and compounding periods per year.",
      "If capitalization is selected, accrued interest from the interest-only period is added to the principal before computing the amortizing payment. The amortizing payment uses the standard annuity formula for level payments: P = r*B / (1-(1+r)^-n) where r is the periodic rate, B is the balance, and n is number of periods.",
      "The calculator intentionally models numeric calculations with typical double-precision patterns; documented standards for numeric integrity and quality management are cited below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Monthly rate = annual_rate / 100 / compounding_per_year",
      "Interest-only payment = principal * monthly_rate",
      "Interest accrued during IO = interest-only payment * (interest_only_period_years * 12)",
      "If capitalization = yes, balance for amortization = principal + interest accrued; otherwise balance = principal",
      "Amortizing payment = remaining_principal * monthly_rate / (1 - (1+monthly_rate)^(-amortization_months))"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $20,000 principal, 6% APR, 2-year interest-only, then amortize over remaining 8 years. Displays interest-only monthly amount for 2 years and the higher amortizing payment thereafter.",
      "Example 2: $50,000 principal, 5% APR, interest-only for full term (select pure interest-only method). Shows recurring interest-only payment and total interest paid if no amortization occurs."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include fees, insurance, or other borrower costs?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is the result exact for every lender and loan product?",
        "answer": "No. Lenders may use different day-count conventions, rounding rules, billing cycles, or define APR differently. Use results as an estimate and verify with your loan servicer or promissory note for contractual payment schedules."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does capitalization mean?",
        "answer": "Capitalization means adding unpaid accrued interest to the loan principal, increasing the balance that will be amortized. If interest is paid during the interest-only period, capitalization does not occur."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these numbers and what are the limitations?",
        "answer": "This calculator follows common numerical methods for loan math and aligns with quality and numeric integrity best practices. Results are estimates: rounding, lender rounding policies, transaction timing, and extra fees can produce differences. For critical decisions, confirm with official loan documents or your servicer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do numbers change when I change compounding periods?",
        "answer": "The periodic (monthly) interest rate is derived from the annual rate and compounding frequency. Different compounding assumptions change the effective periodic rate and therefore payments and interest totals."
