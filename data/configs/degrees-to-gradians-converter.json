      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms degrees to gradians (gons), used in surveying and specialized engineering.",
        "Gradians divide the circle into 400 equal parts (vs degrees' 360), enabling easier decimal calculations.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 90 degrees equals 100 gradians."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "100 grad = 90°. To convert degrees to gradians, multiply by 10/9 (or 1.11111...).",
        "Gradians (also called gons or grades) are natural for decimal calculations.",
        "Surveyors and engineers sometimes use gradians for angle measurements.",
        "This converter provides precise angle conversion for surveying work."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Right angle: 90° = 100 grad.",
        "Example 2 – Full circle: 360° = 400 grad.",
        "Example 3 – Common angle: 45° = 50 grad."

        {
          "question": "Why use gradians instead of degrees?",
          "answer": "Decimal-based system. 100 grad in right angle enables easier calculations and measurements."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where are gradians actually used?",
          "answer": "Surveying, construction, some European countries. Less common than degrees or radians."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the conversion formula?",
          "answer": "Gradians = Degrees × (10/9). Or Gradians = Degrees × 1.1111..."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is 1 gradian equal to 1 degree?",
          "answer": "No. 1 grad ≈ 0.9°. 100 grad = 90°, so grad is slightly smaller than degree."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many gradians in a circle?",
          "answer": "400 gradians in full circle (360°). Quarter circle = 100 grad."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do surveying instruments use gradians?",
          "answer": "Some do, especially in Europe. But degrees remain more common globally."

        {
          "question": "Can I use gradians in trigonometry?",
          "answer": "Yes, but uncommon. Most math uses degrees or radians. Trigonometric tables available for gradians."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why didn't gradians become standard?",
          "answer": "Historical momentum. Degrees established first. Radians proved more natural for math."
