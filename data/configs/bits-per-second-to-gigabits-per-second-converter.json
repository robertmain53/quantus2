      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms data transfer rates from bits per second to gigabits per second, enabling network speed comparison.",
        "Internet speeds span from kilobits to gigabits per second depending on connection type and quality.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 1 gigabit per second equals 1 billion bits per second."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps. To convert bps to Gbps, divide by 1,000,000,000.",
        "Network speeds have increased dramatically: dial-up (56 kbps) to fiber (1-10 Gbps).",
        "Understanding bps to Gbps conversion is essential for evaluating internet connection quality.",
        "This converter provides precise data rate conversion for network planning."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Ethernet: 1,000,000,000 bps = 1 Gbps.",
        "Example 2 – Fast connection: 500,000,000 bps = 0.5 Gbps.",
        "Example 3 – Fiber optic: 10,000,000,000 bps = 10 Gbps."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is data transfer rate measured in?",
          "answer": "Bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's a typical home internet speed?",
          "answer": "Modern broadband: 50-300 Mbps. Fiber: 500 Mbps to 1 Gbps. 5G: 100+ Mbps mobile."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do internet speeds vary?",
          "answer": "Distance from infrastructure, network congestion, equipment quality, and service tier affect actual speeds."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Gbps the same as GB/s?",
          "answer": "No. Gbps is gigabits per second. GB/s is gigabytes per second (8x faster). 1 GB/s = 8 Gbps."
        },
        {
          "question": "What download speed do I need?",
          "answer": "5 Mbps (streaming), 25 Mbps (multiple users), 100+ Mbps (4K video/gaming)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is 5G?",
          "answer": "5G typical: 50-200 Mbps. Peak: up to 1+ Gbps in ideal conditions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is gigabit Ethernet?",
          "answer": "Wired connection standard providing 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps data transfer."

        {
          "question": "How do I test my connection speed?",
          "answer": "Use online tools like Speedtest.net to measure your actual download and upload speeds."
