    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts data transfer rates expressed in bits per second (bps) into gigabits per second (Gbps) using the SI (decimal) definition of the prefix Giga = 10^9. It is intended for engineering, network planning, and measurement tasks where standard decimal prefixes are expected.",
      "By default the tool uses the decimal (SI) relationship: 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps. For contexts that require binary prefixes (Gibibit, GiB) the converter includes notes and alternative formulas showing the 2^30 relationship used by IEC/ISO standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion applies the International System of Units (SI) decimal prefix 'Giga' which equals 10^9. This is the convention used by networking standards, many vendors, and official metrology guidance.",
      "When users require a binary-prefix alternative, the IEC standard defines 'gibi' (Gi) where 1 Gibit = 2^30 bits ≈ 1,073,741,824 bits. We provide both forms so you can confirm results against measurement devices or documentation that use binary prefixes.",
      "Practical note for measurements: instrument reporting, firmware rounding, or packet-overhead can cause reported throughput to differ from theoretical conversions. For traceable calibration and test-method guidance consult NIST and FCC recommendations referenced below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) gigabits: Gbps = bps ÷ 1,000,000,000",
      "Binary (IEC) gibibits (alternative): Gibps = bps ÷ 1,073,741,824",
      "Bits to bytes: divide bps by 8 to get bytes per second; conversely multiply GB/s by 8 to get Gbps (decimal)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000,000,000 bps → 1 Gbps (decimal)",
      "10,000,000 bps → 0.01 Gbps",
      "1,073,741,824 bps → 1 Gibit/s (1 Gibps, binary definition ≈ 1.0737 Gbps decimal)",
      "125,000,000 bytes per second → 1 Gbps (125,000,000 B/s × 8 = 1,000,000,000 bps)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What's the exact relationship between bps and Gbps?",
        "answer": "Using SI (decimal) prefixes: 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps (10^9). For binary-prefix contexts, 1 gibibit per second (Gibps) = 2^30 bits = 1,073,741,824 bps."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use decimal Gbps vs binary Gibps?",
        "answer": "Use decimal Gbps (10^9) for networking specifications, service-level agreements, and most vendor documentation. Use binary Gibps (2^30) only when the documentation or measurement system explicitly references IEC binary prefixes (Gi)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert bits to bytes and relate GB/s to Gbps?",
        "answer": "There are 8 bits in a byte. To convert bps to bytes per second, divide by 8. To convert gigabytes per second (GB/s, decimal) to gigabits per second (Gbps), multiply GB/s by 8 (1 GB/s = 8 Gbps, decimal)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might my measured throughput not match the converted number?",
        "answer": "Real-world throughput differs due to protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgements), link-layer framing, device CPU limits, and measurement tool rounding. Also check whether the tool reports decimal or binary prefixes and whether it reports line-rate vs payload rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there authoritative references for these conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) documents SI prefixes and recommended usage; the IEC and ISO set binary-prefix standards. See the citation list for direct references."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report results for regulatory or procurement documents?",
        "answer": "Report the unit system you used (decimal vs binary) and include the conversion factor. For procurement and compliance, follow the specific regulatory or contract wording; many agencies and vendors expect SI/decimal prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do measurement instruments need calibration for data-rate tests?",
        "answer": "Yes. For repeatable, traceable measurements, use calibrated test equipment and documented test procedures. NIST and FCC provide guidance on test methodologies and traceability for communications measurements."
