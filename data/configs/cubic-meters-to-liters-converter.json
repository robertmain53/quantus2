    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a single value from cubic meters (m³) to liters (L) using the exact SI relationship. It is intended for quick calculations, validation checks, and documentation where a reliable unit conversion is required.",
      "The conversion is exact under the defined unit relationship used by the International System of Units (SI). For physical measurements, consider instrument accuracy, calibration status, and applicable standards before using converted values for compliance or safety-critical decisions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "A liter is defined as one cubic decimeter. One cubic meter equals one thousand liters. This converter applies that fixed mathematical relationship without approximation.",
      "For measurement workflows, follow applicable standards for instrument calibration and uncertainty reporting. Relevant standards and guidance include NIST material on SI units, the BIPM SI brochure, ISO standards on quantities and units, and laboratory competence standards such as ISO/IEC 17025. For workplace handling and safety when measuring or transferring volumes, consult OSHA guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 m³ = 1000 L.",
      "To convert: multiply the value in cubic meters by 1000. Example formula: liters = cubic_meters × 1000.",
      "No rounding is applied by default; display precision depends on the user interface. For reporting, round according to measurement uncertainty and relevant standards."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.5 m³ → 0.5 × 1000 = 500 L",
      "2.345 m³ → 2.345 × 1000 = 2345 L",
      "0 m³ → 0 × 1000 = 0 L"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter performs an exact unit conversion using the SI-defined relationship of 1 m³ = 1000 L.",
      "When applied to measured quantities, always consider instrument uncertainty, calibration status, and applicable standards before using converted results in regulatory or safety contexts."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship 1 cubic meter equals 1000 liters is exact by definition of the liter and cubic meter in the SI system."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I worry about precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "For pure unit conversion the math is exact. For reported results based on measurements, round according to the measurement uncertainty and the number of significant figures warranted by your instruments and standards such as ISO/IEC 17025."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does temperature or pressure affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "The unit conversion itself is independent of temperature and pressure. However, when converting measured volumes of compressible fluids or gases, real-world volume depends on temperature and pressure; use state-corrected methods (for example, standard conditions) and appropriate standards to adjust measured volumes before or after unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I document converted values for audits or reports?",
        "answer": "Record the original measured value, units, instrument identification and calibration status, the conversion performed (including the exact factor used), and the number of significant figures or rounding rule. Reference applicable standards used for measurement and reporting."
