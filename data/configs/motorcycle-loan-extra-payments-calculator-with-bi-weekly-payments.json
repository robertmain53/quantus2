    "introduction": [
      "This calculator models accelerated payoff strategies for motorcycle loans when you make bi‑weekly payments and/or add extra payments. It compares a standard amortization schedule to scenarios with recurring extra payments and one‑time lump sum reductions, returning time‑to‑payoff, total interest, and total paid.",
      "Use the fields to enter the loan amount, APR, term, and payment frequency. Default payment frequency is 26 (bi‑weekly). For recurring extra payments enter a fixed amount each period. For a single paydown, enter the lump sum and the period when it will be applied."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard amortization formulas. Periodic interest rate r is APR/100 divided by payments per year. The scheduled periodic payment is computed from the annuity formula. When recurring extra payments are added, we use a closed‑form logarithmic solution to estimate the reduced number of periods required to amortize the loan at the higher payment.",
      "For one‑time lump sums the calculator computes the outstanding balance immediately before the lump application, subtracts the lump amount, and then recomputes remaining periods using the same amortization relationships.",
      "This tool adheres to software quality and risk‑management best practices referenced by NIST and ISO for numerical accuracy and traceability. It is not a substitute for official loan disclosures; use outputs for planning only. For controls and algorithmic transparency see IEEE guidance and use secure handling per NIST cybersecurity recommendations. Workplace safety and physical handling of vehicles are outside the scope; see OSHA for safety standards."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate r = APR / 100 / payments_per_year",
      "Scheduled payment = principal * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)), where n = term_years * payments_per_year",
      "With recurring extra payment E: solve for new number of periods N' using N' = -ln(1 - principal * r / (scheduled_payment + E)) / ln(1 + r)",
      "For lump sum at period L: compute balance before lump, subtract lump, then solve remaining periods using the standard logarithmic solution with the scheduled payment"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why choose bi‑weekly instead of monthly?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly at 26 payments per year typically results in the equivalent of 13 monthly payments per year (because 26 half‑payments = 13 full payments), accelerating principal reduction and reducing interest over the life of the loan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the results exact?",
        "answer": "Results are produced using closed‑form amortization formulas and logarithmic solutions. They are precise within the mathematical model but do not replace lender statements. Actual payoff can differ due to rounding rules, payment posting dates, fees, or promotional interest treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What safety and compliance standards were consulted?",
        "answer": "Numerical accuracy, documentation, and secure handling recommendations referenced NIST and ISO standards for software quality and cybersecurity; algorithmic transparency aligns with IEEE guidance. This calculator does not provide legal, tax, or binding financial advice."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I interpret negative or non‑real results?",
      "answer": "If the periodic payment (scheduled payment plus extra) is lower than the interest portion for a period (for example, payment is less than or equal to principal multiplied by r), the model cannot amortize the loan and will return non‑real or infinite payoff times. Increase payment or consult your lender."
