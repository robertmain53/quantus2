    "introduction": [
      "This calculator compares a standard monthly mortgage payment schedule to a bi‑weekly schedule that uses 26 payments per year (every two weeks). It shows estimated periodic payments, total interest paid under each schedule, and estimated interest savings when using a true bi‑weekly amortization with 26 payments per year.",
      "Use this tool for planning and comparison only. It assumes a fixed nominal annual interest rate compounded at the payment frequency and does not include taxes, insurance, fees, escrow, changing rates, or lender-specific rounding/processing rules."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Periodic payment formulas follow the standard amortizing loan formula: payment = r * P / (1 - (1 + r)^-N), where r is the periodic interest rate and N is the total number of payments. Monthly calculations use 12 periods per year; bi‑weekly calculations use 26 periods per year.",
      "Outputs are numerical estimates derived from the user inputs. Where the annual interest rate is zero, the payment reduces to principal divided by the total number of payments. This calculator does not perform lender-specific adjustments, nor does it substitute for a lender payoff quote."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1) Convert annual_rate_percent to a periodic rate: monthly r = annual_rate_percent/100/12; bi‑weekly r = annual_rate_percent/100/26.",
      "2) Compute total number of payments: monthly N = term_years * 12; bi‑weekly N = term_years * 26.",
      "3) Compute periodic payment using payment = (r * principal) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-N)).",
      "4) Total interest = (periodic payment * N) - principal. Interest saved = total_interest_monthly - total_interest_biweekly."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $300,000 principal, 4.0% APR, 30 years. Monthly payment and bi‑weekly payment are computed using the formulas above; bi‑weekly schedule typically reduces total interest because it results in more frequent compounding periods and effectively makes an extra monthly payment each year (26 half‑payments vs 12 full payments).",
      "Example 2: Zero interest rate: a $100,000 principal over 10 years yields payments of $833.33 monthly or $384.62 bi‑weekly (if using exact division by number of payments)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Bi‑weekly amortization with 26 payments per year commonly reduces total interest versus 12 monthly payments because it increases payment frequency and results in effectively extra payments per year.",
      "Actual lender implementations vary. Some services accept two half‑monthly payments but treat them as a single monthly payment (24 periods per year), which does not produce the same savings as a true 26‑payment bi‑weekly schedule."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between bi‑weekly (26) and semi‑monthly (24) payments?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly means every two weeks, yielding 26 payments per year. Semi‑monthly means twice per month on fixed dates, yielding 24 payments per year. A true 26‑payment bi‑weekly plan typically reduces interest more than a 24‑payment plan because it results in an extra full monthly payment over the year."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include taxes, insurance, or escrow?",
        "answer": "No. This tool calculates principal and interest only. Add taxes, insurance, HOA fees, and other charges separately to estimate total monthly housing cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are results exact for my loan payoff?",
        "answer": "No. Results are estimates based on mathematical amortization. Lender rounding, payment application order (interest vs principal), fees, prepayment penalties, and differing compounding/statement rules will affect your actual payoff. Always request a payoff quote from your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "What assumptions could invalidate these estimates?",
        "answer": "Assumptions include: fixed nominal rate for the full term, no additional principal prepayments except as modeled, interest calculated at the specified periodic frequency, and no lender rounding or fees. Adjustable‑rate mortgages, escrow advances, and payment holidays will alter real results."
