1. This is a converter because it converts one unit (Euros) to another unit (Swiss Francs) using a fixed, single-step relationship (exchange rate lookup applied to one input amount).  
2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".  
3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].  
4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.  
5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no meta keys, no UI/layout/styling fields, etc.).  
6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
