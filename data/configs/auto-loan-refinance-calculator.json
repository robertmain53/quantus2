    "introduction": [
      "This calculator compares your existing auto loan to a proposed refinance and supports bi‑weekly and other payment frequencies. It estimates periodic payments, total interest cost, break‑even time and net savings after fees.",
      "Results are estimates intended to help decision making. The model uses standard amortization mathematics and assumes a fixed APR, fixed payment schedule, and fees as entered. Real lender offers may include different terms, rounding rules, or prepayment penalties."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Periodic payment is computed using the standard amortization formula: payment = r * P / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where r is the periodic interest rate and n is the number of payments.",
      "To compare schedules we convert APR to a periodic rate based on the selected payment frequency (12 = monthly, 26 = bi‑weekly, 52 = weekly) and compute total interest as (payment * number_of_payments) - principal. Financing of fees increases principal accordingly.",
      "Design and quality considerations reference industry standards for numerical methods and software quality. Security and data handling recommendations follow NIST guidance and general ISO quality principles; consult a lender for exact contractual numbers."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert APR to periodic rate: periodic_rate = APR / 100 / payments_per_year.",
      "Step 2: Compute number of payments: n = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Step 3: Compute periodic payment using the amortization formula.",
      "Step 4: Total interest = (periodic_payment * n) - principal (principal includes financed fees if any).",
      "Step 5: Interest saved = total_interest_current - total_interest_refinance. Net savings subtracts any financed fees you will not repay up front.",
      "Step 6: Break‑even in payments = financed_fees / (current_periodic_payment - refinance_periodic_payment). Converted to years by dividing by refinance payments per year."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $15,000 remaining at 6.0% APR, 3 years left, monthly payments vs refinance to 4.0% APR with bi‑weekly payments and $300 financed fees. The tool will show the new periodic payment, estimated interest saved, and years to recover fees.",
      "Example: Paying a small extra amount each period reduces total interest and can shorten the break‑even time when refinancing fees are present."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does switching to bi‑weekly always save money?",
        "answer": "Not always. Bi‑weekly schedules can reduce interest by increasing effective payment frequency, but actual savings depend on APR, whether fees are financed, payment rounding rules, and whether your lender applies payments immediately to principal. Use the calculator inputs to model your precise scenario and verify with your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these numbers exact for legal disclosure?",
        "answer": "No. These are estimates for planning purposes only. Lender disclosures (including APR, payment rounding, timing, and fees) determine legally binding amounts. For loan closing figures, rely on the lender's Good Faith Estimate or final disclosure."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the calculations and what are the limits?",
        "answer": "Calculations use standard amortization formulas and double‑precision arithmetic assumptions. They do not model variable interest rates, prepayment penalties, escrow, or irregular extra payments beyond the single extra payment field. Rounding and lender-specific application of payments may change results. See the accuracy caveats and standards references below."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is my data handled?",
        "answer": "This tool performs calculations locally in your browser; do not enter sensitive personal data beyond loan numeric fields. For production deployment, follow NIST SP 800‑63 (digital identity) and NIST cybersecurity guidance for handling, transmitting, and storing financial data."
