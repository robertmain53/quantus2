1. This is an advanced_calc because EBIT can be computed by multiple, valid methods (directly from income-statement line items or by back-calculating from net income using add-backs) and the tool must support conditional variables and alternative workflows.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or unexpected form fields for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
