    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a single numeric power value between kilowatts and gigawatts using the exact SI relationship. It is intended for quick engineering, reporting, and educational use when a single scalar conversion is required.",
      "The converter follows the fixed mathematical ratio between units and provides guidance on rounding, significant figures, and regulatory-relevant considerations to help you report results appropriately in technical or compliance contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is a fixed base-10 scaling based on SI definitions. The relationship used is exact and independent of measurement method: 1 gigawatt equals one million kilowatts.",
      "For computational accuracy the converter uses standard floating-point arithmetic for intermediate calculations. For final reporting, choose rounding and significant figures that reflect the measurement device tolerance and applicable standards.",
      "When using converted values in regulated documents or safety calculations, follow measurement and reporting conventions from national and international standards bodies to ensure compliance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition: 1 GW = 1,000,000 kW.",
      "To convert from kilowatts to gigawatts: GW = kW × 1e-6.",
      "To convert from gigawatts to kilowatts: kW = GW × 1e6.",
      "Round results according to the measurement uncertainty and significant-figure rules; for numeric computation IEEE 754 double precision is recommended and appropriate for typical engineering use."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 500000 kW to GW: 500000 × 1e-6 = 0.5 GW.",
      "Convert 12345 kW to GW: 12345 × 1e-6 = 0.012345 GW. Round as required by reporting tolerance.",
      "Convert 200 GW to kW: 200 × 1e6 = 200000000 kW."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter applies the exact SI scale factor between kilowatts and gigawatts. Use the simple multiplication factors shown and apply rounding that reflects measurement uncertainty.",
      "For energy quantities expressed in kilowatt-hours or gigawatt-hours use an energy converter instead; this tool is for instantaneous power units only."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical scaling between kilowatts and gigawatts is exact: 1 GW equals 1,000,000 kW. Any approximation arises only from numeric rounding when formatting results for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I convert kilowatt-hours to gigawatt-hours with this tool?",
        "answer": "No. Kilowatt-hour and gigawatt-hour are energy units and require the same numeric scale factor but represent energy, not instantaneous power. Use an energy converter labeled for kilowatt-hour to gigawatt-hour to avoid context errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match decimal places to the measurement uncertainty and the audience. For instrumentation-level data, follow significant-figure conventions recommended by national metrology guidelines. For high-level reporting, 2 or 3 significant digits are common unless standards require otherwise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or regulatory considerations when converting power units?",
        "answer": "Unit conversion itself does not change hazard. When conversions feed safety calculations or permit documents, apply relevant electrical safety standards and workplace regulations to the underlying measurement and to any protective measures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can floating-point rounding introduce errors for very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Floating-point arithmetic can introduce minimal rounding error at extreme magnitudes. For typical engineering ranges this is negligible. If you require guaranteed integer-scale exactness for very large integers, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or integer scaling before display."
