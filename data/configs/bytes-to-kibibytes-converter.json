    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a quantity in bytes into kibibytes (KiB) using the IEC/IEEE binary-prefix definition: 1 KiB = 2^10 = 1024 bytes. Use KiB when you need unambiguous binary multiples in technical, engineering, or procurement contexts.",
      "The converter is intended for software engineers, system administrators, analysts, and technical writers who require precise, standards-aligned conversions and clear guidance on differences between binary and decimal storage units."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the IEC/IEEE binary-prefix definition: kibibyte (KiB) is a binary multiple equal to 2^10 bytes. The conversion is a fixed ratio and is implemented as an exact integer division or floating-point division depending on the requested precision.",
      "For display and downstream calculations we recommend choosing precision appropriate to the context: use integer KiB when working with raw byte counts (to avoid fractional KiB), and fractional KiB (with specified decimal places) when reporting averages, throughput, or storage utilization metrics."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1 KiB = 2^10 bytes = 1024 bytes.",
      "To convert bytes to KiB: KiB = bytes ÷ 1024.",
      "To convert KiB to bytes: bytes = KiB × 1024."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2048 bytes → 2048 ÷ 1024 = 2 KiB",
      "1536 bytes → 1536 ÷ 1024 = 1.5 KiB",
      "1,048,576 bytes → 1,048,576 ÷ 1024 = 1024 KiB = 1 MiB"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between KB and KiB?",
        "answer": "KiB (kibibyte) is a binary prefix defined by IEC/IEEE equal to 1024 bytes (2^10). KB (kilobyte) is commonly used in two ways: historically as 1024 bytes in computing, and per SI as 1000 bytes in decimal usage. For unambiguous, standards-compliant communication use KiB for 1024-based counts and kB for 1000-based counts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do hard drive manufacturers report different sizes than my OS?",
        "answer": "Some manufacturers use decimal prefixes (kB = 1000 bytes, MB = 10^6 bytes) for marketing, while many operating systems and technical contexts report binary-based sizes (KiB = 1024 bytes, MiB = 1024^2 bytes). This leads to apparent discrepancies; converting consistently with the chosen prefix set resolves the difference."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "For raw storage accounting use integer bytes or integer KiB to avoid losing small amounts. For reporting (throughput, averages) choose a fixed number of decimal places (typically 1–3) and document the rounding rule. When exact totals are needed, keep values in bytes and convert only for presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can conversions overflow or lose accuracy?",
        "answer": "If you store counts in fixed-size integer types, extremely large byte counts can overflow. Use appropriate integer width (e.g., 64-bit) or arbitrary-precision arithmetic for very large values. For floating-point conversions, be mindful of binary floating rounding; keep canonical counts in integer bytes when exactness matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use KiB in documentation or procurement?",
        "answer": "Use KiB (and other IEC binary prefixes like MiB, GiB) whenever clarity about binary multiples is required—technical specifications, contract language, firmware, and low-level system documentation. For consumer-facing marketing where decimal units are intended, use kB/MB with explicit definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter handle bits or other units?",
        "answer": "This converter specifically converts bytes to kibibytes. To convert bits to kibibytes first convert bits to bytes (1 byte = 8 bits), then bytes to KiB using division by 1024. Use dedicated converters for other unit families to avoid mistakes."
