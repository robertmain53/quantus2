    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts frequency values from megahertz (MHz) to hertz (Hz). The relationship is fixed by the International System of Units (SI): the prefix mega denotes 10^6, so 1 MHz equals 1,000,000 Hz.",
      "Use the converter for quick unit transformations for calculations, documentation, lab measurements, RF planning, or reporting. Results are suitable for display, scientific notation, or further computation in engineering workflows.",
      "For measurement-grade work, pay attention to instrument accuracy, sample rates, and uncertainty reporting. Authoritative references such as NIST and BIPM detail SI definitions and prefix usage; regulatory bodies like the FCC provide frequency allocation and emission guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the SI prefix mapping: 'mega' = 10^6. Conversion is a fixed multiplication — no approximation or context-dependent factors are required.",
      "Internally the calculation multiplies the input value in MHz by 1,000,000 (10^6) to yield Hz. For large or small values the result can be displayed in full integer form or as scientific notation depending on user preference in the UI.",
      "When reporting converted values for labs or compliance, include the number of significant figures and an uncertainty estimate that reflects measurement instrument limits (see FAQs for calibration and uncertainty guidance)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: Hz = MHz × 10^6",
      "Example: 2.5 MHz → 2.5 × 10^6 = 2,500,000 Hz",
      "For scientific notation: 2.5 MHz = 2.5 × 10^6 Hz; for integer display, show 2500000 Hz with appropriate separators for readability."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between MHz and Hz?",
        "answer": "1 megahertz (1 MHz) equals 1,000,000 hertz (1,000,000 Hz). This follows the SI prefix 'mega' which denotes 10^6 as defined by international metrology standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round the result or use scientific notation?",
        "answer": "Round according to the required number of significant figures for your application. Use scientific notation for very large or very small numbers to preserve clarity (for example, 3.2 MHz = 3.2 × 10^6 Hz). For lab reports include uncertainty and significant figures consistent with your measurement instrument."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do instrument limits affect converted frequency values?",
        "answer": "The converter performs a mathematical transform only. Measurement uncertainty comes from your instrument (frequency counter, spectrum analyzer, oscilloscope). Check the device specification for frequency accuracy, resolution, and sample rate, and propagate those uncertainties when reporting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert fractional MHz (e.g., 0.00012 MHz)?",
        "answer": "Yes. Fractional megahertz values convert identically by multiplying by 10^6. Example: 0.00012 MHz × 10^6 = 120 Hz. Use scientific notation for very small results if that improves readability."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use kHz or GHz instead of Hz for display?",
        "answer": "Choose the unit that keeps numeric values within a practical range for human reading. Typical engineering practice: use Hz for low-frequency signals where integer counts are convenient, kHz or MHz for medium-range RF, GHz for microwave-range frequencies. Maintain clarity by labeling units and using SI prefixes consistently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety considerations related to frequency values?",
        "answer": "Frequencies themselves are unit measures; regulatory concerns arise in how equipment transmits or occupies spectrum. Consult regulatory authorities for allocations and emission limits (for example national telecommunications agencies). For exposure or safety standards, consult relevant government guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references on SI prefixes and unit definitions?",
        "answer": "Authoritative sources include national metrology institutes and the international bodies that maintain the SI. References from organizations such as NIST and BIPM provide official definitions of the hertz and SI prefixes."
