    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms MHz to raw Hz for detailed frequency analysis.",
      "Engineering calculations often require Hz while radio specs use MHz.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 megahertz equals 1 million hertz."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz. To convert MHz to Hz, multiply by 1,000,000.",
      "Expressing frequencies in Hz reveals the true oscillation rate.",
      "Understanding frequency conversion is essential for signal processing.",
      "This converter provides precise frequency conversion for engineering."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – FM station: 88.5 MHz = 88,500,000 Hz.",
      "Example 2 – Cell tower: 900 MHz = 900,000,000 Hz.",
      "Example 3 – WiFi band: 2,400 MHz = 2,400,000,000 Hz."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why convert MHz to Hz?",
        "answer": "Engineering calculations require base Hz unit. MHz is convenient shorthand."
      },
      {
        "question": "What frequency ranges exist?",
        "answer": "AM: 535-1605 kHz. FM: 88-108 MHz. Cellular: 700-2100 MHz. WiFi: 2400 and 5000 MHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is GHz?",
        "answer": "1 GHz = 1,000 MHz = 1 billion cycles per second. Very fast oscillation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the fastest radio frequency?",
        "answer": "Terahertz: 1,000 GHz. Used in experimental imaging and sensing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does frequency affect signal range?",
        "answer": "Yes. Lower frequencies penetrate farther. Higher frequencies have shorter range."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's interference?",
        "answer": "When two signals occupy same frequency, they interfere and degrade reception."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate wavelength?",
        "answer": "Wavelength = Speed of light / Frequency. Radio ~3m at 100 MHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why allocate frequency bands?",
        "answer": "Prevent interference. Each application gets exclusive frequency range."
