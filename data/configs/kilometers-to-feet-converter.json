    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a distance value in kilometers (km) to feet (ft) using the standard international definition of the foot. It is intended for engineering, construction, travel, and general-purpose unit conversion where values are reported to a chosen precision.",
      "Results are produced deterministically from the internationally accepted relationship between the metre and the foot and are suitable for reporting, design checks, and quick calculations. See the methodology and accuracy notes below for details on which definition of the foot is used and how rounding is handled."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the international foot defined as exactly 0.3048 metres and the SI definition of the metre. The conversion factor is derived from these definitions: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres and 1 foot = 0.3048 metres.",
      "This implementation applies the exact relationship to compute a high-precision numeric result and then formats the output according to typical display precision. Users should consider required significant figures for engineering or regulatory reporting and consult national metrology guidance for traceability requirements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Conversion factor: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres; 1 foot = 0.3048 metres (international foot). Therefore 1 kilometre = 1000 / 0.3048 = 3280.839895013123... feet.",
      "Formula used by the calculator: feet = kilometres × 3280.839895013123.",
      "Display and rounding: the stored calculation uses full double precision arithmetic where available; displayed results are rounded to a sensible number of decimal places (commonly two) but users should retain extra precision when required for engineering calculations."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1.5 km → 1.5 × 3280.839895013123 = 4921.259842519684 → displayed as 4921.26 ft (rounded to two decimals).",
      "Example 2: 5.2 km → 5.2 × 3280.839895013123 = 17060.36745406824 → displayed as 17060.37 ft.",
      "Example 3: 0 km → 0 ft."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The converter uses exact definitions for the metre and the international foot (1 ft = 0.3048 m exactly). The numeric conversion factor 3280.839895013123... is derived from those definitions. In practice displayed numbers are rounded; internal computation preserves higher precision where the platform permits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which definition of the foot does this tool use?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the international foot (1 ft = 0.3048 m exactly). For specialized surveying work, the US survey foot historically differs slightly; consult national measurement authorities if the US survey foot is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much rounding error should I expect?",
        "answer": "Rounding error depends on display precision and the computing environment. For typical values and two-decimal display, rounding error is negligible for everyday use. For high-precision engineering or scientific work, keep additional significant figures and document the rounding applied. Traceability to SI units is recommended for regulated work."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there practical limits to the values I can convert?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship is valid for any real number. Practical limits are set by the client application and numeric precision (floating-point range). Extremely large magnitudes may overflow or lose precision in typical double-precision arithmetic; split calculations or use arbitrary-precision libraries if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do regulatory or calibration standards apply to unit conversions?",
        "answer": "Unit conversion itself is a mathematical operation, but measurement and reporting often require traceability, calibration, and adherence to standards such as those from national metrology institutes and international standards organizations. Refer to the cited standards and your local regulations for reporting requirements."
