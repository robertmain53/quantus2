    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a distance value expressed in kilometres into feet using the exact conversion derived from international definitions of the metre and the foot. The conversion is a fixed multiplicative relationship and is suitable for engineering, mapping, and everyday use where unit conversion is required.",
      "Results are presented as a numeric value; rounding and displayed precision can affect how the result is interpreted. Where regulatory or metrological traceability is required, follow national metrology guidance and laboratory calibration procedures described by standards bodies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion derives from the international definition of the metre together with the defined relationship between the metre and the foot. One kilometre equals 1 000 metres. One foot is defined as exactly 0.3048 metres (by international agreement). Therefore the conversion factor is exact in mathematical terms.",
      "This tool applies the fixed multiplicative factor (kilometres × 3280.839895013123) to obtain feet. The converter performs the arithmetic using typical IEEE-754 double precision; displayed precision is rounded for readability. For legal, safety-critical, or calibration workflows, use traceable measurement procedures and reference standards from national metrology institutes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilometres to metres: metres = kilometres × 1000",
      "Step 2: Convert metres to feet using the exact definition of the foot: feet = metres ÷ 0.3048",
      "Combined formula: feet = kilometres × 1000 ÷ 0.3048 which simplifies to feet = kilometres × 3280.839895013123"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 km → 3280.839895013123 ft (display typically rounded to 3280.8399 ft)",
      "0.5 km → 1640.4199475065615 ft (display typically rounded to 1640.4199 ft)",
      "-2 km → -6561.679790026246 ft (negative values are mathematically supported and represent direction if applicable)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the kilometre-to-feet factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The factor used here is exact as a mathematical consequence of the defined value of the foot (0.3048 m exactly) and the definition of the kilometre (1000 m). Floating-point representation in software introduces tiny binary rounding errors; those are not errors in the conversion factor but in numeric representation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust for measurements?",
        "answer": "Trust depends on the precision of the original measurement instrument. For everyday use, four to six significant digits are typically sufficient. For calibration, metrology, or regulated reporting, follow the significant-figure, uncertainty, and calibration rules in guidance from national metrology institutes and relevant standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this handle very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship holds for any finite real number. Practical limits arise from the numeric range of the execution environment (IEEE-754 double precision) and display formatting. Extremely large values may lose integer precision and may be displayed in scientific notation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I calibrate anything for unit conversion?",
        "answer": "Unit conversion itself does not require calibration, but the measurement instruments producing the original kilometre value should be calibrated and traceable to national standards when used for official, safety-critical, or regulatory tasks. Calibration and traceability practices are described by standards bodies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative standards for units and traceability?",
        "answer": "Authoritative sources include national metrology institutes and international standards organizations. See the citations for primary resources on unit definitions, SI guidance, and measurement traceability."
