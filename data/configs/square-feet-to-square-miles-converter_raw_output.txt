1. This is a converter because it converts between two length-area units with a fixed mathematical relationship (one input → one output: square feet ↔ square meters).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), and no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, or other extra fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
