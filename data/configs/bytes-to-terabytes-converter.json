    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a quantity expressed in bytes (B) to terabytes (TB) using the International System of Units (SI) decimal standard, where 1 TB = 10^12 bytes. It is designed for quick, accurate conversions that match storage-industry decimal reporting and many documentation contexts.",
      "Many computing contexts also use binary-based units (tebibyte, TiB) defined as powers of two (1 TiB = 2^40 bytes ≈ 1.0995 × 10^12 bytes). This page explains the difference and when to use decimal TB versus binary TiB so you can interpret results correctly.",
      "The guidance and formulas below reference established standards and technical documentation from recognized standards bodies and national labs to ensure precision and traceability."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "By default this converter uses the SI decimal mapping: 1 terabyte (TB) = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes (10^12). The conversion simply divides the input byte count by 10^12 to return TB.",
      "When binary/technical contexts require base-2 quantities (common in operating-system memory reporting and some software), use the tebibyte (TiB) mapping where 1 TiB = 2^40 bytes = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. The page documents both so you can verify which standard applies to your use case.",
      "Rounding and display precision depend on your UI or export needs; for audit, compliance, or reporting, retain several decimal places or use integer byte counts to avoid cumulative rounding error."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal terabyte (TB) — used here: TB = bytes ÷ 1,000,000,000,000 (i.e., TB = bytes ÷ 10^12). Example: 2,500,000,000,000 B ÷ 10^12 = 2.5 TB.",
      "Binary tebibyte (TiB) — alternative commonly seen in system tools: TiB = bytes ÷ 1,099,511,627,776 (i.e., bytes ÷ 2^40). Example: 2,500,000,000,000 B ÷ 2^40 ≈ 2.2737 TiB.",
      "Programmatic note: when converting very large integers, use integer-safe types or arbitrary-precision libraries to avoid floating-point rounding (for example, BigInt in JavaScript, arbitrary-precision types in Python/Java)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1,000,000,000,000 bytes → 1.0 TB (decimal): 1,000,000,000,000 ÷ 10^12 = 1 TB.",
      "Convert 1,099,511,627,776 bytes → 1.0 TiB (binary): 1,099,511,627,776 ÷ 2^40 = 1 TiB (≈1.0995 TB decimal).",
      "Convert 500,000,000,000 bytes → 0.5 TB (decimal) or ≈0.455 TiB (binary)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which definition of terabyte (TB) does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the SI decimal definition: 1 TB = 10^12 bytes. The page also explains the binary alternative (tebibyte, TiB = 2^40 bytes) for contexts that require base-2 reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some systems report different sizes (e.g., a 1 TB drive shows as ~0.91 TB)?",
        "answer": "Drive manufacturers usually advertise decimal TB (10^12 bytes). Operating systems or utilities may report sizes using binary-based units (GiB/TiB) or label base-2 values using SI names historically. The mismatch comes from decimal vs binary definitions; for absolute verification compare byte counts."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use TiB instead of TB?",
        "answer": "Use TiB when working with low-level memory, OS internals, or software that explicitly uses binary powers (e.g., 2^10, 2^20, 2^30). Use TB for storage marketing, specifications that cite decimal capacities, and SI-compliant reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I keep for reporting?",
        "answer": "For engineering or audit contexts keep at least three significant digits (e.g., 1.10 TB) or report the exact byte count alongside the converted value. For summary displays 2–3 decimal places are common, but preserve raw bytes for precise calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there practical limits or precision concerns?",
        "answer": "Yes—languages and environments have limits on integer and floating-point precision. For very large byte counts, use integer-safe types (BigInt or arbitrary-precision libraries) to avoid rounding errors. When exporting to CSV or JSON, include both the integer byte value and the converted TB value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do industry standards and regulators treat these units?",
        "answer": "Standards bodies provide formal guidance: SI prefixes (kilo, mega, tera) are decimal (powers of ten), while IEC defined binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi) for powers of two. For compliance and procurement, follow the standard specified by the relevant authority or contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I convert programmatically and reliably?",
        "answer": "Divide the integer byte count by 1,000,000,000,000 for TB (decimal) or by 1,099,511,627,776 for TiB (binary). Use integer-safe or arbitrary-precision types, then format the result to the required number of decimal places for display."
      }
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter returns terabytes using the SI decimal definition (1 TB = 10^12 bytes). If you need binary-based results, convert to tebibytes (TiB = 2^40 bytes) and note the distinction in documentation.",
      "For reproducible reports and audits include the original byte count, the conversion definition used (decimal TB or binary TiB), and the number of decimal places or rounding rules applied."
