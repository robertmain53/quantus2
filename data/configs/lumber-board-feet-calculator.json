    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes board feet and total volume from user-supplied lumber dimensions: thickness (inches), width (inches), length (feet), and piece count. It is intended for quick estimating, purchasing checks, cutting lists, and inventory reconciliation.",
      "Results reflect measured (actual) dimensions. If you work with nominal lumber sizes (for example '2x4' nominal = 1.5\" × 3.5\" actual), enter the actual finished dimensions to get accurate board-foot values. See methodology for guidance on measurement accuracy, waste allowance, and regulatory references."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Board feet are an industry volume unit for lumber. The standard calculation uses thickness in inches, width in inches, and length in feet. Board feet per piece = (thickness_in × width_in × length_ft) ÷ 12. Total board feet = board feet per piece × pieces.",
      "Use calibrated measuring tools (steel tape or calipers) and measure across the widest face for width and the thickest point for thickness. When working with nominal lumber sizes, convert to actual dimensions (nominal → dressed sizes) before calculating. Allow for saw kerf, planing, and shrinkage when estimating required purchase quantities.",
      "For professional and safety standards, consult federal and laboratory references for units and measurement practice. See citations for NIST unit guidance and the USDA Forest Products Laboratory for timber measurement and nominal-to-actual sizing guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Board feet per piece = (thickness in inches × width in inches × length in feet) ÷ 12.",
      "Total board feet = Board feet per piece × Number of pieces.",
      "Total cubic feet = (thickness in inches × width in inches × length in feet) ÷ 144 × Number of pieces."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 — Single 2x6 @ 8 ft (use actual size): actual thickness 1.5 in, width 5.5 in, length 8 ft. Board feet per piece = (1.5 × 5.5 × 8) ÷ 12 = 5.5 BDFT. Ten pieces = 55 BDFT; total cubic feet ≈ 4.583 ft³.",
      "Example 2 — 50 boards of 3/4\" × 10\" × 12 ft: per piece BDFT = (0.75 × 10 × 12) ÷ 12 = 7.5 BDFT. Total = 7.5 × 50 = 375 BDFT."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a board foot?",
        "answer": "A board foot is a volume unit equal to 1 inch × 12 inches × 12 inches (equivalently 12 board inches), commonly used in the lumber trade to quantify dimensional lumber."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I enter nominal or actual dimensions?",
        "answer": "Enter actual (measured) dimensions for accurate results. Nominal sizes (e.g., '2x4') refer to rough or pre-dressed dimensions; finished sizes are smaller (a finished 2x4 is typically 1.5\" × 3.5\"). Use actual sizes to calculate board feet precisely."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results?",
        "answer": "Round board-foot results consistent with your procurement practice. For quick estimates round to two decimal places. For billing or inventory, follow the rounding rules used by your supplier or job specifications (some operations round to the nearest 1/8 or 1/10 BDFT)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I account for waste, kerf, and defects?",
        "answer": "Include a waste allowance based on cutting pattern and saw type. Typical allowances range from 5% to 15% depending on species, joinery, and yield. Account for saw kerf (blade width) when planning cuts and deduct expected defect percentages when reconciling usable board feet."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert board feet to cubic meters or other units?",
        "answer": "Yes. Board feet can be converted to cubic feet (1 BDFT = 1/12 ft³) and then to cubic meters using standard unit conversion factors. For regulatory or lab-grade conversions, consult NIST unit guidance for exact factors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate will this calculator be compared to a scale or invoices?",
        "answer": "Accuracy depends on the precision of your measurements and whether you used nominal or actual dimensions. This tool uses mathematical definitions; differences from scale/invoice values arise from rounding, nominal sizing, moisture content, and vendor-specific measurement conventions. When accuracy matters for trade or compliance, verify with calibrated instruments and reference standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does moisture content affect board feet?",
        "answer": "Board-foot calculations are geometric and do not change with moisture content. However, moisture affects weight and may change dimensions slightly due to shrinkage or swelling; allow for this when moving from green to dried stock."
