    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a quantity in bytes to gigabytes using the SI (decimal) definition where 1 gigabyte (GB) = 10^9 bytes. It is appropriate for cases where disk capacity, data transfer, or storage service billing use decimal prefixes.",
      "Modern practice distinguishes decimal gigabytes (GB = 10^9 bytes) from binary gibibytes (GiB = 2^30 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes). This tool defaults to the decimal GB convention and explains the binary alternative so you can pick the right interpretation for your workflow."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses a fixed mathematical ratio between bytes and decimal gigabytes: divide the byte count by 1,000,000,000 (10^9). This follows SI prefix conventions used in engineering and by most storage manufacturers' published capacities.",
      "When comparing to operating system or utility reports, be aware some software reports sizes in binary gibibytes (GiB). For accuracy-sensitive work—capacity planning, procurement, or billing—confirm whether the counter uses decimal (10^9) or binary (2^30) scaling.",
      "For authoritative definitions of SI prefixes and binary-prefix standards consult national metrology guidance and international standards bodies listed in the citations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal gigabyte (GB) calculation used here: GB = bytes ÷ 1,000,000,000 (10^9).",
      "Binary gibibyte (GiB) alternative (for comparison): GiB = bytes ÷ 1,073,741,824 (2^30).",
      "Rounding and display: the raw quotient is returned; user interfaces commonly format results to a chosen number of decimal places for readability. For engineering accuracy, preserve at least 6 significant figures before any downstream rounding."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000,000,000 bytes → 1.0 GB (decimal)",
      "5,000,000,000 bytes → 5.0 GB (decimal)",
      "1,073,741,824 bytes → 1.073741824 GB (decimal) ≈ 1 GiB (binary)",
      "500,000,000 bytes → 0.5 GB (decimal)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does this tool use 1,000,000,000 bytes per GB instead of 1,073,741,824?",
        "answer": "This tool defaults to the SI decimal definition where 1 GB = 10^9 bytes because that is the convention used by most storage manufacturers and many industry billing practices. The binary value (2^30) is a different unit called a gibibyte (GiB). We provide the binary formula in the methodology so you can convert to GiB when needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I compare values reported by my operating system to manufacturer specifications?",
        "answer": "Manufacturers typically quote decimal GB (10^9). Many operating systems historically display binary-based sizes (GiB) without labeling, which makes drives appear smaller. To compare, convert both values to the same base: either convert manufacturer decimal GB to bytes, or convert OS GiB to bytes using the appropriate divisor, then compare bytes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding or precision should I use for capacity planning?",
        "answer": "Preserve a minimum of 6 significant digits for engineering calculations to avoid cumulative rounding error. For reporting to stakeholders, round to 2–3 decimal places (e.g., 1.07 GB) and always indicate whether figures use decimal (GB) or binary (GiB) units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this tool handle very large byte values (terabytes, petabytes)?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion is a simple division by 10^9, so you can input very large integers up to platform numeric limits. For extremely large values, consider using scientific notation or specialized big-number tools to avoid floating-point precision loss."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there an industry standard or government guidance on which definition to use?",
        "answer": "Standards bodies have formalized binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi) and SI provides decimal prefixes. For official definitions and clarifications consult national metrology agencies and the international electrotechnical standards referenced in the citations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from gigabytes to bytes?",
        "answer": "To convert decimal GB back to bytes multiply by 1,000,000,000 (10^9). For binary GiB multiply by 1,073,741,824 (2^30)."
