Uses SI (decimal) prefixes consistent with NIST and common telecom practice; includes guidance on binary prefixes, measurement limits, and best practices for accurate throughput reporting."

    "introduction": [
      "Convert kilobits per second (kbps) to megabits per second (Mbps) using the SI (decimal) relationship commonly used in networking and broadband service metrics.",
      "This tool uses the standard decimal prefixes where kilo = 1,000 and mega = 1,000,000. That means 1 Mbps = 1,000 kbps in decimal terms. If you need binary-based units (kibibit/mebibit), see the methodology and citations for guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Network transfer rates are typically reported using SI (decimal) prefixes: kilo = 10^3 and mega = 10^6. The converter applies that fixed ratio: 1 megabit per second = 1,000 kilobits per second.",
      "When precise engineering or storage calculations require binary prefixes, the IEC/NIST conventions distinguish kibibit (Kib, 2^10 bits) and mebibit (Mib, 2^20 bits). This converter uses decimal-based units by default because telecommunications and broadband advertising commonly use SI prefixes.",
      "Measured throughput on a real network can differ from nominal link rates due to protocol overhead (Ethernet, IP, TCP), encryption, retransmits, and measurement tool resolution. For accurate measurement, use well-calibrated test tools, wired connections, and repeat tests at different times."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic decimal formula: Mbps = Kbps ÷ 1,000.",
      "Example arithmetic: 5,000 kbps → 5,000 ÷ 1,000 = 5 Mbps.",
      "If you need binary units: Mib/s = Kib/s ÷ 1,024. Do not mix decimal and binary prefixes without converting explicitly.",
      "To convert to megabytes per second (MB/s, decimal): MB/s = (Kbps ÷ 8) ÷ 1,000 = Kbps ÷ 8,000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 2500 kbps → 2500 ÷ 1000 = 2.5 Mbps.",
      "Convert 8000 kbps to MB/s → 8000 ÷ 8,000 = 1.0 MB/s (decimal megabytes per second)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do you divide by 1,000 instead of 1,024?",
        "answer": "Telecommunications and broadband speed advertising generally use SI (decimal) prefixes where kilo = 1,000. Binary prefixes (kibi = 1,024) are used for memory and some storage contexts. For network data rates, use 1,000 unless you explicitly require kibibit/mebibit conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert kbps to kilobytes per second (KB/s) or megabytes per second (MB/s)?",
        "answer": "First convert bits to bytes by dividing by 8, then apply the decimal scale. Example: KB/s (decimal) = Kbps ÷ 8; MB/s (decimal) = Kbps ÷ 8,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will this conversion reflect actual download speed I see in my browser or speed test?",
        "answer": "No. This converter provides a mathematical unit conversion. Actual observed download speed is affected by protocol overhead, congestion, server capacity, and client factors. Use calibrated speed-test tools and multiple measurements for realistic throughput estimates."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about overhead from headers and transport protocols?",
        "answer": "Protocol overhead (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, TLS) reduces payload throughput relative to raw link rate. When estimating usable payload throughput, subtract expected protocol overhead or measure end-to-end payload rate directly with test tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards references for using SI prefixes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Standards bodies and measurement programs (for example, NIST guidance on prefixes and federal broadband measurement programs) use SI prefixes for communication rates. See the citation section for links to NIST and government measurement guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is this converter and how should I report values?",
        "answer": "The converter uses an exact mathematical ratio (1 Mbps = 1,000 kbps). For reporting, round to a sensible number of significant digits based on measurement precision and instrument limitations—typically two or three significant figures for consumer-speed reporting, more for engineering use."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use kibibits (Kib) or mebibits (Mib)?",
        "answer": "Use binary-prefixed units (kibibit, mebibit) when working with systems or specifications that explicitly use powers of two—commonly memory and some low-level storage contexts. For networking and ISP speeds, use decimal (kbps/Mbps) unless the specification states otherwise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Any practical tips for accurate network throughput measurement?",
        "answer": "Use a wired connection, minimize background traffic, run multiple tests at different times, use server and client with sufficient capacity, and use well-known measurement tools that report payload rates and overhead separately."
