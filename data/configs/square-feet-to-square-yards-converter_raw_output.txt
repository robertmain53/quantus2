1. This is a converter because converting square feet to square meters is a fixed mathematical relationship between two units, requires one input and produces one output.

2. I will use component_type: 'converter' with logic.type: 'conversion'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, calculator, form for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
