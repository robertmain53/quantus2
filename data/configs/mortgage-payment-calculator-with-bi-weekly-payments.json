    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates mortgage payment outcomes when you pay at different frequencies, including bi‑weekly (26 payments per year). Enter the home price and down payment (or use the loan amount directly), the APR, term, frequency, and any extra principal you plan to add each period.",
      "Results include the scheduled payment (no extra), the payment with extra principal, an estimate of how many periods until payoff when paying extra, total estimated paid, and estimated interest saved compared with the original schedule. Use the tool for planning and comparing strategies; final payoff timing can vary due to rounding, lender rules, and payment application timing."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator uses standard amortization mathematics: the periodic rate equals the APR divided by the number of payments per year, and the scheduled payment is calculated from the annuity formula for a fixed-rate loan.",
      "When extra principal is added each period, the number of periods required to amortize the loan reduces. The estimate for periods to payoff is derived from the algebraic inversion of the amortization recurrence (logarithmic solution). Results are numerical estimates and assume payments are applied immediately to principal and interest in the stated frequency.",
      "This tool follows software quality and numeric accuracy guidance and cites applicable standards to help ensure trustworthy output. Calculations are subject to floating point rounding consistent with common IEEE 754 implementations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Loan principal = home_price * (1 - down_payment_percent / 100).",
      "Periodic rate r = (APR / 100) / payments_per_year. Number of scheduled periods n = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Scheduled payment = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n).",
      "If paying extra per period, estimated periods to payoff N satisfies: payment_with_extra * (1 - (1 + r)^-N) / r = P, algebraically inverted to N = ln( payment_with_extra / (payment_with_extra - P*r) ) / ln(1 + r).",
      "Total paid (estimated) = payment_with_extra * N. Total interest = Total paid - P."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does bi‑weekly always save interest vs monthly?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly payment plans can save interest because you make the equivalent of one extra monthly payment per year (26 bi‑weekly payments ≈ 13 monthly payments). Savings depend on whether your lender applies payments to principal immediately and how they treat amortization; this calculator assumes immediate principal reduction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is bi‑weekly the same as semi‑monthly?",
        "answer": "No. Bi‑weekly means every two weeks (26 payments per year). Semi‑monthly refers to twice a month (24 payments). The timing difference affects interest calculations and payoff speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the payoff estimates with extra payments?",
        "answer": "Estimates use closed‑form algebraic formulas assuming constant payment_with_extra and immediate application to principal. Actual payoff may differ due to payment timing, lender rounding, escrow changes, fees, or payment application policies. See accuracy caveats below."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use APR or periodic rate from my lender?",
        "answer": "Use the APR (annual interest rate) reported by the lender for this calculator. If your loan documents provide a periodic nominal rate, that rate divided by payments per year should match APR for fixed-rate loans; disclose differences to your lender if unclear."
