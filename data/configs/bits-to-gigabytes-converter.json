    "introduction": [
      "Use this converter to translate a value in bits (b) to gigabytes (GB). It follows the standard SI decimal convention used by storage vendors and many network planning tools.",
      "For contexts that require binary prefixes (GiB), see the methodology notes to understand how the underlying bit-to-byte relationship combines with prefix choices."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base relationship: 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal (SI) prefixes use powers of 10, so 1 gigabyte (GB) = 1,000,000,000 bytes.",
      "Conversion path (decimal): bits → bytes (÷8) → gigabytes (÷1,000,000,000). Combined: GB = bits ÷ (8 × 10^9).",
      "Binary context: if you need gibibytes (GiB), use 1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes. The bit-to-byte step remains ÷8; replace the divisor with 1,073,741,824 for GiB."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula (decimal GB): gigabytes = bits ÷ (8 × 1,000,000,000).",
      "Binary comparison: gibibytes = bits ÷ (8 × 1,073,741,824).",
      "For reporting, round to a sensible number of decimals; keep full precision internally for audits or billing."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "8,000,000,000 bits → 8,000,000,000 ÷ (8 × 1,000,000,000) = 1 GB.",
      "40,000,000,000 bits → 5 GB (decimal).",
      "8,589,934,592 bits → 1 GiB (binary reference) because 8,589,934,592 ÷ (8 × 1,073,741,824) = 1."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which convention does this tool use by default?",
        "answer": "The default is decimal SI prefixes: 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes. Use the binary notes if you need GiB."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some systems show smaller values in GB than I expect?",
        "answer": "Many operating systems use binary units (GiB) but label them as GB, leading to smaller displayed numbers. The underlying byte count is the same; the difference is the divisor (1,000,000,000 vs 1,073,741,824)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round for reports?",
        "answer": "Keep full precision for calculations. Round to the number of decimal places required by your audience or specification—common practice is 2–3 decimals for summaries and more for engineering or billing."
