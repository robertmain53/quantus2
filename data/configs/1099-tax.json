    "introduction": [
      "This calculator provides an estimate of federal self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare), an approximate federal income tax, an estimated state tax, total estimated tax due after withholdings and prior estimated payments, and suggested quarterly payment amounts.",
      "Estimates are intended for planning and budgeting. They do not replace official tax preparation or filing and should be used alongside IRS guidance and a qualified tax professional when necessary."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Self-employment tax is calculated from net business earnings after allowable business expenses. The tool uses the employer-equivalent adjustment (92.35% of net earnings) to determine the Social Security and Medicare components, and applies a Social Security wage base cap to the Social Security portion.",
      "Federal income tax is approximated using a conservative effective-rate approach in detailed mode to keep calculations transparent and fast. For precise bracket-by-bracket liability, consult IRS tax tables or tax preparation software.",
      "Data handling and quality follow recognized engineering and security practices. This product references general standards for data integrity and security (NIST, ISO, IEEE) and adheres to general workplace safety documentation practices (OSHA) for internal operational procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Net earnings = max(0, gross income + other income - business expenses - retirement contributions - health insurance premiums).",
      "Self-employment taxable earnings = 92.35% × Net earnings.",
      "Self-employment tax = (min(self-employment taxable earnings, Social Security wage base) × 12.4%) + (self-employment taxable earnings × 2.9%).",
      "Federal taxable income (approx) = max(0, Net earnings - (half of self-employment tax) - standard deduction).",
      "Total estimated tax due = self-employment tax + federal income tax estimate + state tax estimate - withholdings - prior estimated payments."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this the exact tax I will owe?",
        "answer": "No. This is an estimate for planning. It uses standard formulas for self-employment tax and a simplified federal income tax approximation. Final liability can differ due to credits, itemized deductions, tax credits, AMT, Additional Medicare Tax, exact bracket calculations, and state-specific rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for the Social Security cap and Additional Medicare Tax?",
        "answer": "The calculator applies a Social Security wage base cap for the Social Security portion. It does not automatically calculate Additional Medicare Tax thresholds by filing status; consult IRS guidance or a tax advisor for high-income situations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on the quarterly payment suggestions to avoid penalties?",
        "answer": "Quarterly suggestions are a guideline. Avoiding underpayment penalties depends on meeting safe-harbor rules and paying sufficient amounts during the year. Use IRS resources or a tax professional for compliant payment planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the federal income tax estimate?",
        "answer": "The federal income tax estimate is intentionally conservative and simplified to keep the tool fast and transparent. For exact bracket-level calculations, use IRS tax tables or full tax-preparation software."
