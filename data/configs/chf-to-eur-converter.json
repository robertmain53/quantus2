    "introduction": [
      "Convert Swiss francs (CHF) to euros (EUR) with an instantly calculated, timestamped result. This tool returns an indicative currency amount based on up-to-the-minute reference rates and standard numeric rounding suitable for display and planning.",
      "Results are intended for information and planning only; final amounts for transfers, card payments, or FX trades may differ because providers apply spreads, commissions, and execution timing. For official reference rates, consult national central banks and official publications."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We obtain a market reference rate (EUR per CHF) from aggregated, authoritative rate sources and liquidity feeds. The displayed conversion multiplies the user-entered CHF amount by that reference rate and applies conservative numeric rounding to two decimal places for currency display.",
      "Reference and publication practices follow standard financial-data procedures: source attribution and timestamping, clear separation of indicative rate versus executable quote, and numeric rounding consistent with ISO 4217 currency conventions and general metrology guidance (see ISO and NIST references in citations).",
      "For regulatory and audit traceability, each displayed result includes a timestamp and the source feed identifier so users can compare with central-bank published reference rates (for example, the European Central Bank) or the issuing bank's live quote."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Lookup: Retrieve current reference exchange rate for CHF → EUR from aggregated market feeds and central-bank publications.",
      "Multiply: Convert amount in CHF to EUR by multiplying CHF amount × reference rate (EUR per CHF).",
      "Round: Apply currency rounding to two decimal places (minor unit) following ISO 4217 conventions unless user selection or regulatory context requires alternate precision.",
      "Timestamp & source: Attach the rate timestamp and source identifier so the user can verify age and provenance of the rate."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What rate does this converter use?",
        "answer": "The converter uses an aggregated market reference rate obtained from authoritative financial feeds and central-bank publications. The tool displays the source identifier and timestamp for each result so you can verify origin and freshness."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is the converter result different from my bank or payment provider?",
        "answer": "Banks and payment providers typically show an executable quote that includes their spread, commissions, or a different execution timestamp. This tool provides an indicative reference conversion; final executed amounts will reflect provider markup, execution timing, and any fees."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often are rates updated?",
        "answer": "Rates are refreshed continuously from market feeds and periodically reconciled with central-bank reference publications. Each displayed conversion includes the rate timestamp indicating the exact moment the rate was observed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter include fees or limits?",
        "answer": "No. The displayed amount is a pure currency conversion (CHF × rate → EUR). It does not include transfer fees, card fees, payment network charges, or counterparty limits. For payments or trades, consult your provider for total cost and limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the calculation and why two decimals?",
        "answer": "Currency display defaults to two decimals (minor unit) per ISO 4217 for euro and Swiss franc common usage. Backend calculations may use higher precision and round only for display. For settlement or accounting, preserve full precision until final rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool a regulated payment or FX service?",
        "answer": "No. This converter is an informational tool. It does not execute payments or FX trades. For regulated transfer or trading services, use a licensed provider and review their compliance, KYC/AML, and consumer protections."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I verify official reference rates?",
        "answer": "Consult central-bank publications such as the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank for official daily reference rates and methodologies. Links are provided in the citations section."
