    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a speed in kilometres per hour (km/h) into a dimensionless fraction of the speed of light (c). The speed of light in vacuum is used as the reference so results indicate how many times the given speed fits into that defined constant.",
      "The calculation relies on the SI definition of the speed of light and simple unit conversion (hours to seconds). Results are suitable for engineering, educational, and reporting purposes; see the accuracy and standards section for regulatory and metrology context."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool uses the exact SI-defined value of the speed of light in vacuum: c = 299,792,458 metres per second. Converting metres per second to kilometres per hour yields an exact reference speed in km/h because SI defines c exactly.",
      "Conversion proceeds by first converting the input from km/h to km/s (divide by 3600), then dividing that result by the value of c expressed in km/s. This produces a unitless fraction (for example, 1.0 indicates exactly the speed of light).",
      "Accuracy and provenance follow recommended metrology practice. Where relevant, the calculator cites the NIST CODATA value and the SI definition; users should consult applicable ISO or IEEE standards for formal reporting requirements in regulated workflows."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Use SI-defined speed of light: c = 299,792,458 m/s = 299,792.458 km/s.",
      "Step 2: Convert input speed from km/h to km/s: v_km_s = v_km_h / 3600.",
      "Step 3: Compute fraction of c: v_c = v_km_s / 299,792.458.",
      "Compact formula: v_c = (v_km_h / 3600) / 299792.458 = v_km_h / 1,079,252,848.8.",
      "Interpretation: v_c is dimensionless. Values much less than 1 are non-relativistic; for velocities approaching c, relativistic velocity addition and Lorentz transformations are required for physical predictions beyond unit conversion."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100 km/h → v_c = 100 / 1,079,252,848.8 ≈ 9.2660154e-8 (0.000000092660154 c).",
      "Example 2: 1,000 km/h → v_c = 1,000 / 1,079,252,848.8 ≈ 9.2660154e-7 (0.00000092660154 c).",
      "Reference: 1 c = 1,079,252,848.8 km/h (exact given SI definition of c)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship using the SI-defined speed of light and straightforward unit changes (hours ↔ seconds).",
      "Results are exact given the defined value of c; caveats apply when interpreting fractions of c in relativistic contexts or non-vacuum media."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the speed of light value used here exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The speed of light in vacuum is defined by the SI system as exactly 299,792,458 m/s. Therefore the derived value 1,079,252,848.8 km/h is exact for conversions that use the SI definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for relativistic effects?",
        "answer": "No. This is a unit conversion that expresses a classical speed as a fraction of c. For high-velocity physics (close to c) you must use special-relativity formulas such as relativistic velocity addition and Lorentz transformations; this converter does not perform those calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the conversion change if the speed is measured in a medium (air, water)?",
        "answer": "This converter compares speeds to the speed of light in vacuum. Light travels slower in materials; if you need a fraction relative to the light speed in a medium, use the medium-specific light speed and appropriate refractive index, not the vacuum value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report results to meet standards or regulatory requirements?",
        "answer": "Report the numeric value with units and the reference used (SI-defined c). For formal reporting consult the relevant ISO/IEEE documentation and follow local regulatory guidance; document rounding, uncertainty (if any), and the exact reference constants used."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision is appropriate when displaying the fraction of c?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For everyday speeds many decimal places are insignificant; in scientific contexts use significant figures consistent with measurement uncertainty and standards such as those recommended by NIST and ISO."
