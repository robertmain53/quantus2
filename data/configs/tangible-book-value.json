    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates a company's tangible book value (TBV) and related per-share and market ratios from basic balance-sheet inputs. TBV strips goodwill and other identified intangible assets from equity to provide a conservative measure of net tangible worth.",
      "Use the tool to compare asset-backed valuation across peers, to sanity-check market multiples, or as an input to deeper asset-based valuation models. Results depend on the accuracy and accounting treatment of inputs provided; read the methodology and FAQs for important limitations and handling guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Tangible book value (total) is computed as shareholders' equity minus goodwill, other identifiable intangible assets, preferred equity, and noncontrolling interests. This follows standard asset-based reconciliation practices used in financial analysis and valuation.",
      "Per-share TBV divides the adjusted tangible equity by diluted shares outstanding when available. Price-to-TBV divides the observed market price by TBV per share to give a market multiple.",
      "This tool is a calculation aid only. For regulatory reporting, financial statement preparation, audit, or legal purposes, follow applicable accounting standards (FASB ASC, IFRS) and consult qualified professionals.",
      "Data handling and tool design adhere to best-practice guidance for accuracy, validation, and secure processing. Relevant standards include NIST cybersecurity guidance for data protection, ISO quality and information management standards for process reliability, and IEEE recommendations for numerical precision and software engineering controls."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Tangible Book Value = Total Shareholders' Equity - Goodwill - Other Intangible Assets - Preferred Equity - Noncontrolling Interest",
      "Tangible Book Value per Share = Tangible Book Value / Shares Outstanding",
      "Price to TBV (P/TBV) = Market Price per Share / Tangible Book Value per Share",
      "Tangible Equity Ratio = Tangible Book Value / Total Assets"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which inputs are required and what if I don't have diluted shares?",
        "answer": "Required numeric inputs are total shareholders' equity and shares outstanding. If diluted shares are not available, use basic shares outstanding but note this can overstate TBV per share. Where possible use diluted shares to reflect convertible securities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are intangible assets treated?",
        "answer": "The calculator subtracts goodwill and other identified intangible assets as entered. Do not include amortizable or separately recognized intangible assets unless they are reported on the balance sheet as intangible assets. Follow your accounting policy (GAAP or IFRS) when identifying intangibles."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can TBV be negative and what does that mean?",
        "answer": "Yes. A negative TBV indicates liabilities and intangible deductions exceed shareholders' equity, which can signal insolvency risk or heavy intangible capitalization. Interpret negative values carefully and consult financial statements for underlying causes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results and what are their limits?",
        "answer": "Results are as accurate as the inputs and the accounting treatment behind them. This calculator applies straightforward arithmetic and is not a substitute for audited statements or professional valuation. Rounding, timing differences, off-balance-sheet items, and accounting estimates (impairments, reserves) can materially change outcomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security and quality standards support this tool?",
        "answer": "Design, data handling, and validation recommendations align with NIST cybersecurity guidance, ISO quality and information management principles, and IEEE numerical-precision practices. These references are for best-practice alignment; implementation must follow your organization's compliance and governance policies."
