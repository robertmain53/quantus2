    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates bi‑weekly (or any payment frequency you enter) auto loan payments using the standard amortization formula. Enter loan amount, APR, loan term in years, any down payment and fees to see the per‑period payment, total interest, and a comparison against a monthly schedule.",
      "Results assume interest compounds at the payment frequency you provide and that fees are capitalized into the loan balance. Use the payments per year field to calculate semi‑monthly (24), bi‑weekly (26) or monthly (12) schedules. Values are illustrative; consult loan documents and your lender for exact payoff schedules."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the conventional amortizing loan formula where periodic interest rate r = APR / 100 / payments_per_year and number of periods n = term_years × payments_per_year. The periodic payment is P × r / (1 − (1 + r)^−n). Zero-interest loans are handled as straight-line division (principal / n).",
      "Accuracy and numeric stability follow best practices for financial computing. Results are rounded to typical currency precision for display. This tool is intended for planning; final figures from your lender may vary due to rounding conventions, escrow, service charges, or different compounding assumptions.",
      "Compliance and technical rigour: calculations and numeric guidance are aligned with industry standards for computational accuracy and information security. For controls and data handling, follow NIST digital guidance; numerical method expectations reference IEEE best practices; risk management and workplace safety considerations follow applicable OSHA guidance; and financial messaging/payment messaging standards are consistent with ISO recommendations."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Inputs: loan_amount, annual_rate (APR %), term_years, down_payment, fees, payments_per_year.",
      "Net financed principal = loan_amount − down_payment + fees.",
      "Periodic rate r = annual_rate / 100 / payments_per_year; periods n = term_years × payments_per_year.",
      "If APR = 0 → payment = principal / n. Otherwise payment = principal × r / (1 − (1 + r)^−n).",
      "Total paid = payment × n. Total interest = total paid − principal. Comparison to monthly uses identical principal and term but payments_per_year = 12 to compute equivalent monthly totals."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does making bi‑weekly payments always shorten the loan?",
        "answer": "Yes if you make true bi‑weekly payments (26 payments per year) you will typically pay slightly more per year than 12 monthly payments because 26 bi‑weekly payments ≈ 13 monthly equivalents, which shortens the effective term and reduces total interest. If your lender simply divides a monthly payment in half and doesn't apply extra payments, benefits may not occur."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are fees treated?",
        "answer": "By default fees entered are added to the financed principal (capitalized). If your lender treats fees differently (paid upfront or collected separately) adjust the fees and down payment fields accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What assumptions could cause my actual lender numbers to differ?",
        "answer": "Differences arise from compounding conventions, rounding policies, payment allocation rules, prepayment penalties, escrow charges, or timing of first payment. This calculator assumes periodic compounding at the chosen frequency and that each payment is applied to interest then principal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the calculator audited or guaranteed accurate?",
        "answer": "The formula used is the standard amortization model; however, this tool is for estimation only. For regulated accuracy and system controls refer to NIST and IEEE guidance. Always verify final payoff figures with your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if APR = 0?",
        "answer": "The calculator handles zero‑interest loans by dividing the financed principal evenly across the number of periods (principal / n)."
