            "Use this quarter-mile time estimator to translate vehicle weight, wheel horsepower, and trap speed into an estimated quarter-mile elapsed time (ET) and finish-line speed on a 1,320-foot drag strip.",
            "The underlying equations are empirical fits to real drag racing data, originally popularized by engineer Roger Huntington and refined by decades of racers and tuners.",
            "All calculations assume a standing start over a standard quarter mile with good traction and a mechanically healthy vehicle. Real-world results vary with gearing, aerodynamics, surface prep, weather, and driver skill."

        "methodology": [
            "This estimator uses classic drag racing correlations linking ET and trap speed to the ratio between vehicle weight and wheel horsepower.",
            "For the weight and horsepower method, the calculator uses a Huntington-style fit: ET = 5.825 × (weight / horsepower)^(1/3).",
            "The trap-speed method uses hp ≈ weight × (trap speed / 234)^3 to infer wheel horsepower from terminal speed.",
            "Both methods assume straight-line acceleration, efficient power delivery, and clean shifts without excessive wheelspin.",
            "The formulas are calibrated on typical drag strip conditions and should be considered approximations with expected variance."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "Example 1: A 3,600 lb car with 400 wheel horsepower yields an estimated 12.6-second quarter mile.",
            "Example 2: A 2,600 lb lightweight build with 300 wheel horsepower runs a similar ET due to better power-to-weight ratio.",
            "Example 3: A 3,400 lb car trapping 118 mph produces an inferred wheel horsepower used to estimate ET."
        ],
        "summary": [
            "This estimator provides transparent, physics-informed predictions tailored for tuners, engineers, and performance enthusiasts.",
            "Real drag performance depends heavily on traction, weather, and driver technique, so results should be used for planning and comparison rather than certification."
