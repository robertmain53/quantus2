    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single pressure value expressed in kilopascals (kPa) into torr. The relationship is a fixed mathematical ratio derived from the definition of standard atmosphere (1 atm = 101.325 kPa = 760 torr). Use this tool for quick unit translation, reporting, and data entry.",
      "When using converted values for instrumentation setpoints, vacuum specifications, calibrations, or regulatory records, consider measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration status, and the number of significant figures required by your procedure or applicable standard."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the internationally accepted definition that 1 atmosphere equals 101.325 kilopascals and equals 760 torr. From that definition the exact conversion factor for kilopascal to torr is computed as 760 divided by 101.325.",
      "Results shown by this converter are numerical conversions only; they do not account for the measurement uncertainty of the instrument that produced the original kPa value. For compliance or metrology work follow guidance from NIST, ISO, and other applicable standards on calibration intervals and uncertainty reporting."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Conversion factor: 1 kPa = 760 / 101.325 ≈ 7.50061683 torr.",
      "To convert kPa to torr: torr = kPa × 760 / 101.325 (or torr ≈ kPa × 7.50061683).",
      "To convert back: kPa = torr × 101.325 / 760 (or kPa ≈ torr × 0.133322368)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1 kPa → 1 × 7.50061683 ≈ 7.5006 torr",
      "Convert 101.325 kPa → 101.325 × 7.50061683 ≈ 760.000 torr (standard atmosphere)",
      "Convert 0.5 kPa → 0.5 × 7.50061683 ≈ 3.7503 torr"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the torr the same as mmHg?",
        "answer": "The torr is defined as exactly 1/760 of a standard atmosphere. Millimeters of mercury (mmHg) historically depended on mercury density and gravity; in many practical contexts torr and mmHg are treated as equivalent to within typical measurement uncertainty, but for high-precision work use the defined torr or convert using documented standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep?",
        "answer": "Keep as many significant figures as justified by your measurement uncertainty and the requirements of your procedure or standard. For display, three to six significant figures is common; for calibration certificates follow the uncertainty and reporting rules in ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for instrument calibration or uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a purely mathematical unit conversion. It does not include instrument error, calibration uncertainty, or environmental corrections. For traceable results apply the instrument's calibration data and uncertainty budget as described in ISO and NIST metrology guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use torr instead of kPa?",
        "answer": "Use torr where vacuum technology, gas-phase research, or legacy specifications require it. Use kPa for SI-compliant reporting and when working with engineering systems that use SI units. Convert as needed for documentation or equipment interfaces."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "The relationship 760 torr = 101.325 kPa is the defining basis used here. The derived factor 7.50061683 is a numerical representation used for conversion; treat displayed digits according to required reporting precision and uncertainty."
