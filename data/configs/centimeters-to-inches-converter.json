    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single length value from centimetres (cm) to inches (in) using the internationally agreed fixed relationship between the two units. It is designed for everyday measurements, engineering quick-checks, and document preparation where unit clarity and traceability are required.",
      "The tool assumes numeric input representing a length in centimetres and returns the equivalent length in inches. For trustworthy results in professional contexts, follow the guidance on precision, calibration, and measurement uncertainty provided below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the exact definition agreed by international standards bodies: 1 inch is defined as exactly 2.54 centimetres. This is a fixed mathematical relationship, so the conversion is deterministic and not subject to empirical estimation.",
      "Displayed results are numeric conversions only. Where measurement accuracy matters (engineering, manufacturing, health and safety), users should consider the uncertainty of the measuring instrument, round results to an appropriate number of significant figures, and document the measurement method and calibration status of instruments."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: inches = centimetres ÷ 2.54",
      "Equivalently: inches = centimetres × 0.3937007874015748 (exact reciprocal of 2.54).",
      "Rounding guidance: apply rounding to the number of significant digits appropriate for the original measurement instrument. For display purposes a default of 2–4 decimal places is typical for everyday use; specify more decimals only when justified by instrument resolution and calibration."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2.54 cm → 1 in (exact by definition).",
      "10 cm → 3.937007874015748 in (unrounded); commonly shown as 3.9370 in when rounded to four decimal places.",
      "100 cm → 39.37007874015748 in (commonly shown as 39.37 in for everyday applications)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Conversion is exact: 1 in = 2.54 cm. Use the simple formula cm ÷ 2.54 to convert to inches.",
      "When precision matters, combine this conversion with instrument uncertainty, calibration records, and appropriate rounding to significant figures."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor approximate or exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor is exact: 1 inch equals exactly 2.54 centimetres by international agreement. Any deviation in practice stems from measurement error, not the mathematical conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose decimals based on the resolution and calibration of your measuring tool. For casual use 2 decimal places are often sufficient; for engineering or scientific work use as many digits as justified by instrument uncertainty and required tolerances."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs the mathematical unit conversion only. If you need to report measurement uncertainty, combine the numerical conversion with the instrument's calibration certificate or uncertainty estimate before final rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative or very large values?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship applies to any real number of centimetres, including negative values (used in coordinate systems) and very large magnitudes. Be mindful of numeric limits in your application environment if values exceed typical floating-point ranges."
      },
      {
        "question": "What abbreviations are accepted?",
        "answer": "Common abbreviations are 'cm' for centimetres and 'in' for inches. When in doubt in formal documents, include both unit name and abbreviation (for example: 10 cm (3.94 in))."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate measuring instruments?",
        "answer": "Yes. For accurate length measurement you should follow calibration best practices and relevant standards for your industry. Calibration ensures that the numeric value you convert reflects the true physical dimension within documented uncertainty."
