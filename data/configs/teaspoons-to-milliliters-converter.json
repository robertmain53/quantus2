    "introduction": [
      "Use this converter to turn teaspoons (tsp) into precise milliliter (mL) values when you adapt recipes, check nutrition labels, or double-check liquid doses. It is built around the standard definition used in modern food labeling and metric kitchen practice, so that 1 teaspoon is treated as 5 milliliters.",
      "Regulators and metrology institutes encourage using milliliters instead of household spoons when accuracy matters. By anchoring the conversion to these standards, this tool helps you move confidently between traditional kitchen measures and SI units without doing the math in your head.",
      "Whether you are scaling a family recipe, following a dietitian's plan, or preparing an oral solution that lists doses in mL, this teaspoon-to-milliliter converter gives you a quick, consistent answer grounded in government and university guidance, not guesswork."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "For nutrition labeling and most kitchen applications, a teaspoon is defined as exactly 5 milliliters. This value appears in U.S. regulations on food labeling and is reinforced by federal guidance on metric equivalents of common household measures, which also sets 1 tablespoon at 15 mL and 1 cup at 240 mL.",
      "The converter therefore applies a simple linear relationship: milliliters = teaspoons × 5. If you ever need to reverse the process, you can use the inverse relationship, teaspoons = milliliters ÷ 5. These formulas are consistent with kitchen conversion tables published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and by multiple university extension services.",
      "You may see slightly different values in scientific handbooks, because a traditional U.S. teaspoon based on fluid-ounce definitions is about 4.93 mL, while the metric and many international standards round to 5 mL. For home cooking, nutrition labeling, and most dietetic work, the 5 mL definition is preferred because it aligns with SI rounding practice and keeps serving sizes easy to interpret.",
      "National metrology institutes such as NIST publish guidance on using SI units in everyday contexts, including household weights and measures and metric kitchen equivalents. This converter follows those recommendations: it keeps everything in liters and milliliters on the metric side, and it treats teaspoons as approximate household measures linked back to an SI volume.",
      "For clinical or laboratory applications, best practice is to measure directly in milliliters using calibrated syringes, cylinders, or pipettes. Research on medication errors shows that relying on spoon descriptions can increase dosing mistakes compared with mL-only instructions, especially when people reach for non-standard household spoons. In those situations, this converter is most useful as a cross-check, not as a substitute for proper measuring equipment."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "If a recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of vanilla and you want to measure it in metric, multiply 3 × 5 = 15 mL.",
      "A diet plan might limit you to 10 mL of oil per meal. To express that in teaspoons, divide 10 mL by 5 mL per teaspoon and get 2 teaspoons.",
      "If a cooking video mentions adding 0.5 teaspoon of salt, that corresponds to about 2.5 mL in a metric recipe.",
      "A standard U.S. nutrition label that lists a serving size of 2 teaspoons of syrup is using 10 mL as the underlying metric volume."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter uses the regulatory definition 1 teaspoon = 5 milliliters, as adopted in food labeling and metricized kitchen guidance. That choice keeps the math simple, matches most measuring spoons sold today, and aligns teaspoon quantities with the SI unit system.",
      "For everyday cooking and nutrition tracking, the rounding from roughly 4.93 mL to 5 mL per teaspoon is much smaller than the variation introduced by how tightly you pack ingredients into a spoon. When accuracy is critical, you should measure directly in milliliters with calibrated equipment and use this tool only to interpret or translate between teaspoon-based and mL-based instructions."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many milliliters are in 1 teaspoon?",
        "answer": "For kitchen and nutrition labeling purposes, 1 teaspoon is taken as exactly 5 milliliters (mL). This is the value used by food labeling regulations and by many metric kitchen resources, which also define 1 tablespoon as 15 mL and 1 cup as 240 mL."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some references say a teaspoon is about 4.93 mL instead of 5 mL?",
        "answer": "The 4.93 mL value comes from defining a teaspoon as one third of a U.S. tablespoon based on traditional fluid-ounce relationships. When kitchens and regulators converted to metric, they rounded this to a clean 5 mL to simplify labels and recipes. The difference is about 1 to 2 percent, which is negligible for typical home cooking."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter accurate enough for baking and pastry recipes?",
        "answer": "Yes, using 1 teaspoon = 5 mL is more than accurate enough for cakes, breads, and desserts. In practice, variation from how you level the spoon or pack ingredients is usually larger than the 4.93 versus 5 mL difference. For especially sensitive recipes, focus on using consistent level measuring spoons and weighing dry ingredients when you can."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a metric teaspoon the same as a U.S. teaspoon?",
        "answer": "A metric teaspoon is defined as 5 mL, and modern U.S. measuring spoons used in cooking and on nutrition labels are effectively the same size. Historical U.S. volume definitions give a slightly smaller theoretical teaspoon of about 4.93 mL, but in practice most consumer kitchen sets are built around the 5 mL metric standard."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this teaspoon to milliliter conversion for medicines or pediatric doses?",
        "answer": "You can use the 1 teaspoon = 5 mL relationship to understand dosing instructions, but health agencies and medical researchers strongly recommend dosing liquid medicines directly in milliliters using calibrated syringes or cups. Studies show that spoon-based instructions are associated with more dosing errors than clear mL-only directions, so always follow your clinician's advice and use proper dosing tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many teaspoons are in common metric volumes like 10 mL or 15 mL?",
        "answer": "You can estimate the number of teaspoons by dividing the milliliters by 5. For example, 10 mL is 2 teaspoons, 15 mL is 3 teaspoons (about 1 tablespoon), and 2.5 mL is half a teaspoon. The converter automates this calculation for any value you enter."
