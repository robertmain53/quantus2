    "introduction": [
      "This Tiling Cost Calculator estimates how many tiles you need and the likely project cost for a rectangular room by combining area math with common cost inputs: tile price, labor, underlayment and removal. It applies an industry-standard waste allowance so you can purchase the correct quantity and avoid repeat orders.",
      "Results use simple geometric formulas and round-up logic for purchase quantities. For safety, compliance, and best-practice installation guidance consult relevant standards and government guidance linked in the citations below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Compute room area in square feet (length × width). Convert tile dimensions from inches to feet to compute single-tile area (length/12 × width/12).",
      "Divide room area by single-tile area to get tiles required; apply a user-selected waste allowance (commonly 5–15%) to allow for cutting, patterning, and breakage.",
      "Round up to whole tiles for ordering. Material cost assumes price input is per square foot; labor and other costs are multiplied by room area. Total project cost sums materials, labor, underlayment, and removal."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Room area (sq ft) = room_length_ft × room_width_ft",
      "Tile area (sq ft) = (tile_length_in / 12) × (tile_width_in / 12)",
      "Tiles needed (no waste) = Room area / Tile area",
      "Tiles to buy = ceil(Tiles needed × (1 + waste_percent/100))",
      "Tile material cost = Tiles to buy × Tile area × tile_price_per_sqft",
      "Total cost = Tile material cost + (Room area × labor_cost_per_sqft) + (Room area × underlayment_cost_per_sqft) + (Room area × removal_cost_per_sqft)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How much waste allowance should I use?",
        "answer": "Typical waste allowances range from 5% for simple straight-lay installations to 15% or more for diagonal patterns, mosaics, or heavy cutting. Use a higher percent for irregular rooms or complex layouts. This calculator lets you adjust waste percent to match your project risk tolerance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do we round up tiles instead of rounding the area?",
        "answer": "Tiles are sold as whole units. Rounding up the tile count ensures you have enough whole tiles to complete the layout, including cuts and replacements for damaged tiles. This reduces the risk of mismatched batches if you return later to buy more."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator include labor and disposal safety guidance?",
        "answer": "The calculator estimates labor and disposal costs but does not replace safety or regulatory requirements. For workplace safety and handling of old flooring (including potential lead or asbestos hazards), consult OSHA and EPA guidance before demolition or removal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use metric units?",
        "answer": "This version uses feet and inches for common trade practice. Convert metric measurements to feet/inches before entry, or check related calculators that provide metric unit inputs. For unit definitions and conversion standards, see the NIST SI guidance in the citations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are cost estimates?",
        "answer": "Estimates depend entirely on input accuracy. Material prices, labor rates, and hidden site variables (substrate condition, leveling, access) can change final costs. Use these results for planning and budgeting; get a contractor estimate for binding quotes."
