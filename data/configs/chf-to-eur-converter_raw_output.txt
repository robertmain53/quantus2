1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion requires a user-supplied amount and a variable exchange rate (not a fixed mathematical constant), so the calculator needs multiple inputs and a formula-based output.

2. I will use component_type: 'simple_calc' with logic.type: 'formula'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, open_graph, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or a form for converters).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
