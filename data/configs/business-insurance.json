    "introduction": [
      "This estimator produces quick, transparent premium estimates for common small-business insurance needs. It converts your inputs into a budget-grade annual premium using multiple methods so you can compare a revenue-based approach, a payroll/headcount approach, and a line-by-line policy breakdown.",
      "Results are intended for budgeting and planning only. They are not binding quotes. Final rates depend on insurer underwriting, jurisdictional rules, claims history checks, and certified inspections."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool uses simplified exposure-to-premium calculations that combine base loadings with industry and location multipliers to approximate insurer pricing. It is designed to show relative sensitivity to inputs (revenue, payroll, headcount, coverage limits, property values).",
      "To promote transparency and auditability, each method returns component-level variables (for example: payroll component, headcount loading, coverage-limit loading). Assumptions and multipliers are conservative approximations, not proprietary underwriting algorithms."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Revenue method: premium = annual_revenue × industry_risk × location_risk × 0.001 + fixed administrative loading.",
      "Payroll/headcount method: premium = payroll × 0.002 + num_employees × 50 + coverage_limit_loading + fixed administrative loading.",
      "Policy breakdown: separate line estimates for General Liability, Property, and Workers' Compensation are calculated and summed to a total premium."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: A professional services firm with $500,000 revenue in a low-risk location often sees a revenue-method estimate significantly lower than a construction firm with the same revenue because industry_risk is smaller.",
      "Example 2: A small retail shop with moderate payroll and high property value will show a larger property premium component even if revenue-method estimate appears modest."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this a quote I can buy?",
        "answer": "No. These are estimates for budgeting and comparison. A binding quote requires full application, underwriting review, and insurer-specific rate tables."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Accuracy varies by industry and jurisdiction. Expect typical variance of plus or minus 30% for preliminary estimates. Use these results to prepare questions for brokers or carriers; obtain written quotes for procurement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What assumptions should I check with my broker?",
        "answer": "Confirm industry classification, payroll categorization, sales exposures, prior claims detail, and desired policy forms and endorsements. These materially affect final pricing and coverage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is claims history handled?",
        "answer": "This estimator includes a simple claims-count input that increases conservatively via component loadings. Actual underwriting uses loss runs, severity analysis, and insurer-specific experience modifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the limits of this tool?",
        "answer": "It does not model jurisdiction-specific statutory workers' compensation classifications, insurer-specific credits/surcharges, endorsements, or aggregate policy limits. Use it for budget planning only."
