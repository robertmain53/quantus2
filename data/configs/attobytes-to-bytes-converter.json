    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts values expressed in attobytes (symbol: aB) to bytes (symbol: B) using the International System of Units (SI) decimal prefix definition for 'atto' (10^-18). Use it to translate extremely small digital-storage quantities into standard byte units or to format scientific notation for reporting and analysis.",
      "Atto is an SI prefix denoting 10^-18. That means 1 attobyte equals 1 × 10^-18 bytes. The converter follows SI/BIPM conventions and is suitable for academic, engineering, and regulatory reporting where SI prefixes are required.",
      "If you work with binary-prefixed storage quantities (kibi-, mebi-, gibi-), be aware that those are distinct standards (binary powers of 2). This tool applies decimal SI prefixes only."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed SI prefix factor for atto: a = 10^-18. The tool multiplies the numeric input in attobytes by 10^-18 to produce bytes. This approach aligns with SI definitions maintained by BIPM and explanatory material from NIST.",
      "Results are presented in decimal notation and scientific notation where appropriate. For very small inputs, floating-point limits and display rounding can affect the visible digits; we surface recommended rounding and significant-figure guidance in the FAQ.",
      "When preparing values for publication or instrumentation logs, follow the SI conventions for unit symbols and spacing: write the numeric value followed by a space and the unit symbol (for example, 5 × 10^-18 B). For binary-storage conversions, consult standards for binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Identify the numeric value in attobytes (aB).",
      "Step 2: Multiply that value by 10^-18 to convert to bytes (B). Formula: bytes = attobytes × 10^-18.",
      "Example: 7 aB = 7 × 10^-18 B = 7e-18 B. For presentation use either decimal or scientific notation depending on magnitude and significant-figure rules."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between attobytes and bytes?",
        "answer": "1 attobyte (1 aB) = 10^-18 bytes (1e-18 B). The factor comes from the SI prefix 'atto' defined as 10^-18."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter using binary prefixes (kibi, mebi) or SI decimal prefixes?",
        "answer": "This converter uses SI decimal prefixes (atto = 10^-18). Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi) are based on powers of 2 and are different standards; use a binary-prefix converter for those cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle precision and rounding for very small results?",
        "answer": "Use significant-figure rules appropriate to your measurement. For computed values near floating-point limits, present results in scientific notation (for example, 3.2e-18 B) and indicate the number of significant figures. If the value is derived from measured data, propagate measurement uncertainty according to established metrology practice (see NIST guidance)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I write the unit symbol in reports?",
        "answer": "Follow SI recommendations: place a space between the numeric value and the unit symbol, use the correct prefix symbol, and use plain ASCII or Unicode characters as required. Example: '4.5 × 10^-18 B' or '4.5e-18 B'."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert the other way (bytes to attobytes)?",
        "answer": "Yes. To convert bytes to attobytes, divide by 10^-18 (or multiply by 10^18). Example: 2e-18 B = 2 aB."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory standards or references I can cite when publishing conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. Cite SI/BIPM definitions and national metrology guidance (for example, NIST materials) when precise unit definitions are required in reports or compliance documents. Use consistent notation and document rounding or uncertainty handling."
