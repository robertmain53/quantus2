    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts attoBytes (symbol: aB), the SI prefix atto (10^-18) applied to bytes, into bytes. Use this tool when you need an exact decimal-scale conversion for documentation, data modeling, or scientific calculations.",
      "Conversions follow the International System of Units (SI) decimal prefixes. For very small or very large values, use scientific notation or arbitrary-precision arithmetic to avoid rounding or underflow in standard floating-point representations. Results are provided as exact decimal-scale multiplications; if you need binary multiples (kibi, mebi) consult the methodology notes below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The atto prefix corresponds to 10^-18. Therefore 1 attoByte = 10^-18 bytes. We use decimal SI prefix rules as defined by international measurement authorities.",
      "Where binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, etc.) are relevant, those follow IEC/ISO conventions and are not applied to SI-prefixed units like attoByte. For storage-size reporting on computer systems that use binary multiples, convert bytes to the appropriate binary-prefixed unit after this decimal conversion.",
      "Accuracy caveats: standard IEEE 754 double-precision floating point can represent the scale but may lose precision for extreme arithmetic sequences (repeated additions, very large exponents). For high-assurance or regulatory workflows, validate results using arbitrary-precision libraries or integer-based scaling and document rounding rules per your quality standard."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition: 1 attoByte (aB) = 10^-18 bytes.",
      "Conversion formula: bytes = attoBytes × 10^-18.",
      "Practical steps: enter the numeric attoByte value, multiply by 1e-18, report the result in bytes. For very small results, present using scientific notation (for example, 3 aB = 3 × 10^-18 B)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5 aB → 5 × 10^-18 bytes = 5e-18 B",
      "1,000,000 aB → 1,000,000 × 10^-18 bytes = 1e-12 B",
      "0.75 aB → 0.75 × 10^-18 bytes = 7.5e-19 B"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This is a straightforward decimal (SI) prefix conversion: multiply attoBytes by 10^-18 to obtain bytes.",
      "Use scientific notation or arbitrary-precision arithmetic for workflows that require strict traceability or when operating at the extremes of floating-point range."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is an attoByte?",
        "answer": "An attoByte is one quintillionth of a byte, i.e., the SI prefix atto (10^-18) applied to the unit byte. Symbol commonly written as aB."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this the same as binary-prefixed units like 'kibi' or 'mebi'?",
        "answer": "No. SI prefixes (atto, kilo, mega) are decimal (powers of 10). Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi) are powers of 2 and standardized by IEC/ISO. This converter performs decimal SI conversions only."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision and rounding should I expect?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact (multiply by 10^-18). Display and storage precision depend on your numeric environment. For reporting, include an explicit number of significant digits or use scientific notation. For regulatory or audit contexts, record the conversion method, rounding rule, and numeric representation used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can floating-point arithmetic lose this value?",
        "answer": "Very small numbers can underflow or lose significance in limited-precision representations. IEEE 754 double precision can represent numbers at these magnitudes but repeated arithmetic may lose precision. Use arbitrary-precision libraries or integer scaling (store as attoBytes integer and convert only for display) for critical calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards references I should follow?",
        "answer": "Follow SI prefix definitions from international measurement authorities and use IEC/ISO conventions when dealing with binary prefixes. For high-assurance workflows, reference relevant standards and document the numerical precision and rounding policies used."
