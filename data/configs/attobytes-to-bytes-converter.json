    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct SI-prefix conversion from attoBytes to bytes. The atto prefix denotes 10^-18, so the transformation is a fixed multiplication by 1e-18. Use this tool for unit normalization, data logging, scientific notation display, and automated data pipelines where consistent decimal-unit handling is required.",
      "The result is exact in mathematical terms (no subjective interpretation of binary prefixes). The tool includes guidance on rounding, floating-point limits, and applicable standards to help you choose the appropriate precision for analysis, reporting, and automated systems."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) prefix definition: atto = 10^-18. This is a deterministic decimal scaling, not a binary-prefix conversion.",
      "Where binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, etc.) are relevant, those are handled separately; this converter follows SI definitions consistent with international standards.",
      "Precision and representation follow common numeric practice: results are provided in decimal and scientific notation, with recommendations on rounding to avoid misinterpretation in downstream systems."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base relationship: 1 attoByte = 10^-18 bytes.",
      "Primary conversion formula (attoBytes to bytes): bytes = attoBytes × 1e-18.",
      "Inverse conversion (bytes to attoBytes): attoBytes = bytes × 1e18. Use scientific notation for very large or very small values to preserve clarity.",
      "Rounding note: when converting values that result in subnormal floating-point representations, explicitly specify the number of decimal places required by your workflow; for high-precision needs, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic libraries."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 attoByte → 1 × 10^-18 bytes (0.000000000000000001 bytes).",
      "1 000 000 000 000 000 000 attoBytes → 1 byte.",
      "3 attoBytes → 3 × 10^-18 bytes (0.000000000000000003 bytes).",
      "1.5e6 attoBytes → 1.5 × 10^-12 bytes (0.0000000000015 bytes)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter implements the exact SI-based scaling between attoBytes and bytes: multiply by 1e-18.",
      "Verify output precision against your platform's numeric limits and use arbitrary-precision math if exact integer representation is required across extreme exponents."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is an attoByte?",
        "answer": "An attoByte is a decimal unit using the SI prefix atto (10^-18). It denotes one quintillionth of a byte."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this the same as binary 'atto' or 'byte' definitions?",
        "answer": "No. This converter uses SI decimal prefixes (atto = 10^-18). Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, etc.) are different and expressed by separate binary-prefix standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I worry about rounding or precision loss?",
        "answer": "When results are near the limits of your number type (for example, very small decimals in IEEE 754 double precision) or when converting back and forth repeatedly. For critical computations, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic and explicitly define rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standards define these prefixes and conversion practices?",
        "answer": "SI prefixes and unit usage are defined by international standards and guidelines; see the citations for NIST, ISO/IEC, and IEEE references. These sources recommend using decimal SI prefixes for unit labelling unless binary prefixes are explicitly required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does any occupational safety regulation apply to data unit conversions?",
        "answer": "Data unit conversion itself is not covered by occupational safety regulations. OSHA provides workplace safety standards; use of data conversion tools should follow your organization’s data-handling and accuracy policies rather than OSHA rules."
