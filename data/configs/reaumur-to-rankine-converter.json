    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a single temperature value from degrees Réaumur (°Ré) to degrees Rankine (°R) using the mathematically exact relationships between the scales. It is intended for quick engineering, laboratory, educational, and documentation use.",
      "If you require traceable measurements for calibration, compliance, or thermodynamic research, use this numeric conversion as a unit transformation only and follow calibration, uncertainty assessment, and reporting guidance from standards bodies such as NIST and ISO."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is performed by chaining two exact relationships: Réaumur to Celsius, then Celsius to Rankine. Constants used are the defined offsets and scale factors for the International Temperature Scale (for practical conversions we use 0 °C = 273.15 K and the 9/5 ratio between Kelvin and Rankine).",
      "Displayed results are computed with straightforward arithmetic rather than empirical approximations. For high-precision or regulatory work, include instrument uncertainty and calibration traceability to a recognized laboratory as described by NIST and ISO guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert Réaumur to Celsius: °C = °Ré × 1.25",
      "Step 2: Convert Celsius to Rankine: °R = (°C + 273.15) × 9/5",
      "Combined direct formula: °R = (°Ré × 1.25 + 273.15) × 9/5",
      "Simplified algebraic form: °R = °Ré × 2.25 + 491.67. Constants: 273.15 (Celsius to Kelvin) and 9/5 (Kelvin to Rankine). Maintain significant figures appropriate for your application."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 0 °Ré → °R = 0 × 2.25 + 491.67 = 491.67 °R (freezing point of water).",
      "Example 2: 80 °Ré → °R = 80 × 2.25 + 491.67 = 671.67 °R."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact formula to convert degrees Réaumur to degrees Rankine?",
        "answer": "Use °R = (°Ré × 1.25 + 273.15) × 9/5, which simplifies to °R = °Ré × 2.25 + 491.67."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I keep?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on use case: 2 decimal places are usually enough for general documentation, 3–6 significant figures for engineering calculations, and follow your lab's uncertainty and reporting rules for metrology. Always propagate instrument uncertainty when required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for thermodynamic calculations?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact algebraically, but thermodynamic analysis often requires values tied to an international temperature scale and calibrated instruments. For high-precision work follow ITS-90 recommendations and calibration procedures from NIST/ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Réaumur scale still used?",
        "answer": "The Réaumur scale is now rarely used and mainly of historical interest, though you may encounter it in older literature, recipes, or legacy engineering documents. Convert values to modern scales for calculation and reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I consider when using sensor output?",
        "answer": "Sensor readings have measurement uncertainty, drift, and calibration intervals. For compliance or safety-related use, ensure sensors are calibrated to a traceable standard, document uncertainty, and follow applicable safety guidance such as OSHA heat-exposure recommendations."
