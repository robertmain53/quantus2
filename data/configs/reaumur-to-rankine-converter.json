    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts temperatures expressed in degrees Réaumur (°Ré) to degrees Rankine (°R). The conversion is a fixed arithmetic mapping based on the definition of both scales relative to Celsius and absolute temperature.",
      "Use the converter for quick, deterministic conversions in calculations, documentation, or data transcription. For metrology, lab work, or safety-critical measurements, follow calibration and uncertainty best practices described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Réaumur and Rankine are defined relative to more commonly used scales: Réaumur is defined such that 0 °Ré = 0 °C and 80 °Ré = 100 °C; Rankine is an absolute scale based on the Fahrenheit degree where 0 °R = absolute zero (−273.15 °C). Conversions therefore proceed by converting Réaumur → Celsius → Rankine.",
      "The arithmetic conversion implemented is exact (no empirical approximation) for unit conversion. Measurement uncertainty arises from instrument precision, calibration, and reference standards. For traceable measurements, follow ISO/IEC 17025 for calibration labs and NIST/BIPM guidance for temperature scales and realize small differences may exist between practical realizations and the idealized scales."

      "Step 1 (Réaumur to Celsius): °C = °Ré × 1.25",
      "Step 2 (Celsius to Rankine): °R = (°C × 9/5) + 491.67",
      "Combined direct formula: °R = (°Ré × 1.25 × 9/5) + 491.67 = 2.25 × °Ré + 491.67",
      "Note: Use the combined formula for a single-step conversion. For high-accuracy laboratory work verify constants and reference realizations against ITS-90 and lab calibration certificates."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: Convert 20 °Ré → °R. Using °R = 2.25 × °Ré + 491.67 gives °R = 2.25 × 20 + 491.67 = 45 + 491.67 = 536.67 °R.",
      "Example: Convert −10 °Ré → °R. °R = 2.25 × (−10) + 491.67 = −22.5 + 491.67 = 469.17 °R."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion between Réaumur and Rankine exact?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic relationship used by the converter is exact for the defined scale relationships (no empirical fit). However, real-world temperature measurements include uncertainty from instrumentation, calibration, and the chosen temperature realization (e.g., ITS-90). For traceable results follow ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the result include a large offset (around 491.67)?",
        "answer": "Rankine is an absolute temperature scale (zero at absolute zero). The offset 491.67 comes from converting the Celsius zero point into Rankine: 0 °C equals 491.67 °R."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "Round results to a number of decimal places appropriate for your measurement uncertainty and use case. For display-level conversions, two decimal places are common; for engineering or metrology, report values with uncertainty and avoid inappropriate rounding that masks measurement error."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate instruments to use this conversion in lab reports?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion itself is algebraic, but any temperature reading used as input should come from a calibrated instrument with a current calibration certificate. Calibration and uncertainty statements should follow ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST recommendations."
