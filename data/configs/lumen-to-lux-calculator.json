    "introduction": [
      "This advanced lumen-to-lux calculator uses true photometric geometry to compute illuminance at any distance and beam angle. Unlike simple unit converters, lux cannot be derived from lumens without specifying the spatial distribution of light.",
      "Professional lighting designers, LED engineers, and cinematographers use this relationship to verify fixture specifications, predict light levels in spaces, and validate equipment performance.",
      "You get engineering-grade accuracy based on the inverse square law and the solid angle of the optical beam—the same principles used in architectural lighting design and photometric measurement standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Lux is defined as illuminance E = Φ / A (luminous flux per unit area), but real luminaires do not uniformly illuminate a flat surface. Instead, light spreads in a cone determined by the beam angle, and intensity falls off with the square of distance.",
      "The solid angle Ω (in steradians) subtended by a cone is calculated using Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)), where θ is the half-angle of the cone in radians. This formula accounts for the three-dimensional spread of light.",
      "The illuminance at distance d is then E = Φ / (Ω × d²), where d is measured in meters and the result is in lux (lumens per square meter).",
      "This matches the methodology in professional photometric standards (CIE, IES), LED manufacturer datasheets, and engineering lighting design software. The inverse square law ensures that doubling distance reduces illuminance to one-quarter.",
      "Real-world luminaires (spotlights, LEDs, floodlights) use this calculation to determine light distribution. The narrow beam angle concentrates light into a smaller solid angle, dramatically increasing lux at the center of the beam."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – LED spotlight at 1 meter: A 1000 lm LED with a 60° beam angle at 1 m distance produces approximately 1,190 lux at the center of the beam. This is typical for accent lighting in galleries and retail spaces.",
      "Example 2 – Same LED at 2 meters: Moving the lamp to 2 m reduces illuminance to approximately 298 lux (following the inverse square law). At 3 m, it drops to approximately 132 lux.",
      "Example 3 – Narrow beam spotlight: A 1000 lm spotlight with a 30° beam angle at 1 m produces approximately 4,700 lux—over 4× brighter than the 60° beam. Narrow beams concentrate light into smaller areas, essential for task lighting and stage work.",
      "Example 4 – Wide beam floodlight: A 1000 lm floodlight with a 120° beam angle at 1 m produces approximately 149 lux. Wide beams distribute light over large areas, useful for outdoor and general illumination where even coverage matters more than peak brightness."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between lumens and lux?",
        "answer": "Lumens (lm) measure total light output from a source—a fixed property of the luminaire. Lux (lx) measures illuminance, the light falling on a surface at a specific distance—it depends on the geometry and distance. One lumen spread over 1 m² equals 1 lux. The same luminaire produces different lux values at different distances and beam angles."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the inverse square law?",
        "answer": "The inverse square law states that illuminance is inversely proportional to the square of distance: E ∝ 1/d². Doubling distance reduces illuminance to one-quarter. Tripling distance reduces it to one-ninth. This is fundamental in photometry because light spreads over an increasingly large area as it travels from the source."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does beam angle affect lux?",
        "answer": "Narrower beam angles concentrate the same luminous flux into a smaller solid angle, dramatically increasing lux at the beam center. A 30° beam produces much higher lux than a 60° or 120° beam from the same lamp. However, narrow beams illuminate a smaller area, so they're used for accent lighting while wide beams provide general coverage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this calculator suitable for architectural lighting design?",
        "answer": "Yes. Architects and lighting designers use this exact calculation (E = Φ / (Ω × d²)) to verify that proposed fixtures meet illumination targets. Professional lighting software (DIALux, AGi32, Relux) implements this same photometric model. Always verify results against manufacturer photometric files (IES or Eulumdat format) for production specifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a solid angle, and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "A solid angle (Ω, measured in steradians) describes the three-dimensional 'cone' of light. It's calculated from the beam angle using Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)). A narrow beam (small solid angle) concentrates flux, producing high lux. A wide beam (large solid angle) spreads flux, producing low lux. Understanding solid angle is essential for photometric calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for indoor lighting design?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Indoor applications include accent lighting on artwork, spotlights in retail and showrooms, task lighting over desks, and ambient fixtures. For each fixture, estimate its lumen output and beam angle (check the datasheet), then use this calculator to verify that the light level at the surface meets code requirements (typically 300–500 lux for general work areas, 750+ lux for detail work)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I estimate beam angle from a product spec?",
        "answer": "Most LED and fixture datasheets list beam angle directly (e.g., '60° half-angle' or '120° full beam'). If only cone angle is given, divide by 2 to get the half-angle used here. If a photometric diagram (polar plot) is provided, the beam angle is the full cone where intensity drops to 50% of peak (half-peak angle)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for reflections or surface properties?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator assumes direct illuminance from the source onto a surface. Real-world lighting also includes reflected light from walls, ceilings, and surrounding materials. For complete room calculations, use professional lighting software that models reflectances and multiple reflections. This tool is accurate for point-source direct illumination."
