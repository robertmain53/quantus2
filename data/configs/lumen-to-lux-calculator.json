    "introduction": [
      "This advanced lumen-to-lux calculator uses true photometric geometry. Unlike simple converters, lux cannot be derived from lumens without specifying distance and beam angle.",
      "You get engineering-grade accuracy based on the inverse square law and the solid angle of the optical beam."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Lux is defined as E = Φ / A, but real luminaires do not illuminate a flat 1 m² area. The illuminated area depends on distance and the cone of light.",
      "The tool uses the exact solid-angle formula Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)) and then applies E = Φ / (Ω d²).",
      "This matches the methodology discussed in professional lighting design, LED photometry, and the analysis provided in metrological reports."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 lm spotlight, 60° beam, 1 m distance → ~1190 lux",
      "Same lamp at 2 m → ~298 lux",
      "Same lamp but 30° beam → ~4700 lux (narrow beams massively increase lux)"
