    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a quantity in minutes to months using a defined baseline for the length of a month. Because calendar months vary (28–31 days), we use a documented average month for the default calculation to produce consistent, reproducible results.",
      "The page explains the baseline chosen, how the calculation is done, alternative definitions you might need for legal or payroll contexts, and precision and compliance caveats. If you require calendar-specific month counts (for contracts, payroll, or compliance), follow the guidance in the methodology section before relying on a numeric result."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Default baseline: one month is treated as one twelfth of the mean Gregorian year (365.2425 days). This produces an average month length of 365.2425 / 12 = 30.436875 days. Converting to minutes uses 24 hours per day and 60 minutes per hour.",
      "Why this baseline: using the mean Gregorian year avoids bias that would come from picking 30, 30.5, or 31 days. It is the recommended engineering/scientific approach when a single, repeatable conversion factor is required for calculation, averaging, or reporting.",
      "Regulatory and standards context: we reference NIST guidance on SI units for unit consistency, ISO guidance on quantities and units as applied to time, IEEE standards addressing precision time protocols where exact timing matters, and OSHA publications where timekeeping rules affect safety and payroll reporting. For any legally binding or safety-critical use, verify with the applicable jurisdictional regulation or employer policy."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: baseline minute-per-day = 24 hours × 60 minutes = 1440 minutes.",
      "Step 2: average days per month = 365.2425 days per Gregorian year ÷ 12 = 30.436875 days.",
      "Step 3: average minutes per month = 30.436875 days × 1440 minutes/day = 43829.58 minutes (approx).",
      "Formula (default): months = minutes ÷ 43829.58. Alternative exact formulas: use 43200 minutes for a 30-day month, 44640 for a 31-day month, or perform calendar-based counting for a specific start/end date."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 10,000 minutes → using average month: 10000 ÷ 43829.58 ≈ 0.2283 months (≈ 6.94 days).",
      "Example 2: 43,829.58 minutes → using average month: 43829.58 ÷ 43829.58 = 1.0 month (by definition of the average-month baseline)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "No. Because calendar months have variable lengths, any single-number conversion is an approximation. The default uses an average-month baseline (1/12 of a mean Gregorian year) to provide a consistent, reproducible factor. Use calendar-aware methods for exact month counts between dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which definition of a month does this tool use by default?",
        "answer": "By default it uses the average Gregorian month equal to 365.2425 days ÷ 12 (≈30.436875 days), then converted to minutes. This is suitable for engineering, reporting, and estimations where a single conversion factor is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I not use the average-month conversion?",
        "answer": "Do not use the average-month conversion for payroll, contract deadlines, billing, or legal periods where months are defined by calendar dates or employer/jurisdiction rules. In those cases, count actual calendar months or consult the governing regulation or contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision and rounding should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For engineering or reporting, 4–6 significant digits is usually sufficient. For financial, payroll, or legal uses, follow the rounding and precision rules specified by the contract or applicable regulation; default scientific rounding may not be acceptable."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I convert minutes to a specific calendar month span?",
        "answer": "To convert minutes to a calendar-month span, calculate the number of days in each calendar month in the span (accounting for February and leap years), convert those days to minutes (days × 1440), then sum. This converter does not perform calendar-interval computations."
