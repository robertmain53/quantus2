    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a quantity in bytes (B) into tebibytes (TiB) using the binary-prefix standard adopted by international measurement authorities. The conversion is exact under the IEC definition: 1 TiB = 2^40 bytes.",
      "Use this tool for accurate storage sizing, system reporting, or documentation where binary units are required. Results are computed with attention to integer precision and practical numeric limits encountered in common programming environments.",
      "The page includes concise methodology, the formula used for the conversion, and guidance on precision, rounding, and handling very large values in software implementations."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We follow the IEC binary-prefix definition (also referenced by NIST): tebibyte is a binary unit equal to 2^40 bytes. Conversions are performed by dividing the input bytes by 2^40.",
      "Where possible, conversions use exact integer arithmetic. For environments that rely on IEEE 754 double precision, we highlight safe-integer limits and recommend arbitrary-precision integers (for example, BigInt) or server-side calculations for very large values.",
      "Displayed results include a decimal approximation to help with human-readable reporting; for exact byte counts expressed in TiB, use integer arithmetic and avoid lossy floating-point representations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: TiB = bytes ÷ 2^40",
      "Numeric constant: 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776. Therefore TiB = bytes ÷ 1,099,511,627,776.",
      "Example: 5,000,000,000,000 bytes → 5,000,000,000,000 ÷ 1,099,511,627,776 ≈ 4.547 TiB (rounded to three decimal places)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a tebibyte (TiB)?",
        "answer": "A tebibyte (TiB) is a binary-based data size unit defined as 2^40 bytes, which equals 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. It is distinct from decimal-based terabyte (TB) and is standardized by international bodies that define binary prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does TiB differ from TB (terabyte)?",
        "answer": "A terabyte (TB, decimal) equals 10^12 bytes (1,000,000,000,000 bytes). A tebibyte (TiB, binary) equals 2^40 bytes (1,099,511,627,776 bytes). Use TiB when binary prefixes are required; use TB when decimal SI prefixes were intended."
      },
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor do you use?",
        "answer": "We use the exact binary factor 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776. Conversions are performed by dividing the input number of bytes by this integer constant."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose precision for very large numbers?",
        "answer": "Potentially yes if you use floating-point (IEEE 754 double) arithmetic for very large integers. JavaScript Number values are safe only up to 2^53−1 (9,007,199,254,740,991). For byte counts larger than that, use arbitrary-precision integers (for example BigInt in modern JavaScript) or server-side big-number libraries to preserve exactness."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for reporting?",
        "answer": "Round to the number of decimal places appropriate for your audience (commonly 2–3 decimals for human-readable storage sizes). For technical reporting where exactness matters, present both the integer byte count and the exact TiB expressed as a rational with denominator 2^40 or compute using arbitrary-precision integers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do these definitions and recommendations come from?",
        "answer": "The binary-prefix definitions are standardized by international standards organizations and referenced by national measurement institutes. Guidance on numeric precision follows common engineering practice for IEEE 754 arithmetic and modern programming-language features for arbitrary-precision numbers."
