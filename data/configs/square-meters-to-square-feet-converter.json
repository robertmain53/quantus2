    "introduction": [
      "Convert area values from square meters (m²) to square feet (ft²) for architecture, real estate, engineering, energy modeling, and general use. This converter returns results consistent with international unit definitions used by standards bodies and federal agencies.",
      "The conversion is based on the exact definition of the international foot: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters exactly. Because that linear relationship is exact, the derived area relationship between square meters and square feet is exact and reproducible.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit changes, reporting, or to verify values from plans and specifications. For legal or contractual submissions, confirm any formatting, rounding, or definition requirements with the relevant authority or standards referenced in the citations."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the internationally agreed linear definition of the foot: 1 ft = 0.3048 m (exact). Square both sides to derive the area relationship.",
      "From the exact linear equivalence, 1 ft² = 0.09290304 m² exactly. Invert that to get 1 m² = 1 / 0.09290304 ft² = 10.763910416709722 ft² (displayed rounded as needed).",
      "The converter applies that exact relationship and then formats the numeric result according to the display precision you choose. For engineering and surveying, carry enough significant figures to match measurement uncertainty before final rounding."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base constant: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters (exact by international agreement).",
      "Area relationship: 1 ft² = (0.3048 m)² = 0.09290304 m² (exact).",
      "Conversion formulas: ft² = m² ÷ 0.09290304  OR  ft² = m² × 10.763910416709722.",
      "Round results only after applying the exact conversion; choose rounding consistent with measurement precision or reporting standards."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The conversion is exact in the sense that it is derived from the exact defined value of the international foot (1 ft = 0.3048 m exactly). This produces an exact algebraic relationship between m² and ft²; displayed numbers are rounded for readability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many square feet are in 1 square meter?",
        "answer": "1 square meter = 10.763910416709722 square feet. Most contexts present this as 10.7639 ft² or 10.764 ft² depending on rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose precision when converting?",
        "answer": "Match the precision to the measurement uncertainty. For conceptual conversions, 4–6 significant digits are usually enough (e.g., 10.7639). For engineering or energy modeling keep more digits until the final reporting stage; for legal documents follow the local regulatory rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some calculators show slightly different results?",
        "answer": "Differences come from display rounding or from using fewer significant digits. The underlying exact relationship is fixed; any discrepancy is almost always due to rounding or formatting choices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for surveying or legal measurements?",
        "answer": "This converter provides mathematically exact unit conversion. For survey-grade or legal measurements, you must also account for measurement uncertainty, datum, projection, and the definitions required by local regulations or contracts. Confirm with the relevant standards or authorities before final submission."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do building codes or listings define area differently?",
        "answer": "Yes. ‘Gross area’, ‘net leasable area’, and other definitions vary by code, standard, and jurisdiction. This tool only converts numeric units; consult local building codes or standards (for example, ANSI, ISO, or local municipal codes) for area definitions used in compliance or listings."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle very large or very small numbers?",
        "answer": "For extremely large or small areas, consider scientific notation or confirm that your target system accepts the formatted value. Retain sufficient significant figures and apply rounding rules only at the final reporting stage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does instrument calibration affect conversion results?",
        "answer": "Conversion itself is exact and unaffected by instrument calibration. However, any measurement taken in the field is subject to instrument accuracy and calibration, which determines how many digits you should report after conversion."
