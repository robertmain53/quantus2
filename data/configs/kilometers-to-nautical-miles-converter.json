    "introduction": [
      "This converter lets you turn distances in kilometers into nautical miles using the internationally accepted relationship 1 nautical mile = 1,852 meters.",
      "Nautical miles are the standard distance unit in marine and aviation navigation because they are tied to the Earth's latitude–longitude grid, while kilometers are the SI unit used in maps, engineering, and logistics.",
      "Use this tool when you need quick, reliable conversions for passage planning, flight plans, shipping routes, survey lines, or to reconcile navigation outputs with metric documentation and reports."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter is based on the international nautical mile, defined by international hydrographic and standards bodies as exactly 1,852 meters. This definition is documented by national metrology institutes such as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and reflected in government conversion tables and handbooks.",
      "Because 1 kilometer is exactly 1,000 meters, the relationship between kilometers (km) and nautical miles (nmi) follows directly from the ratio 1 nmi = 1,852 m. If D_km is the distance in kilometers, then D_nmi = D_km × (1,000 / 1,852) ≈ D_km × 0.5399568. Equivalently, you can think of the conversion as D_nmi = D_km ÷ 1.852.",
      "In practice, navigation texts and training materials typically round the factor to 1 nmi ≈ 1.852 km or 1 km ≈ 0.54 nmi for quick mental estimates. The calculator uses the exact ratio implied by the international definition and performs the arithmetic in double precision, so the only limitations on accuracy in real-world use come from the precision of the input distance itself, for example rounding of GPS or chart-derived distances.",
      "The international nautical mile is closely tied to the geometry of the Earth: one nautical mile corresponds to one minute of arc (1/60 of a degree) of latitude along a meridian on an idealized Earth. Modern navigation handbooks, land-navigation courses, and nautical chart guides emphasize that this geometric link is why nautical miles remain the preferred unit in marine and aviation navigation even though the SI base unit of length is the meter.",
      "When converting for operational planning, it is good practice to match the precision of the converted value to both the scale of the route and the precision of your source data. For example, a coastal hop of 40 km reported to the nearest tenth of a kilometer does not justify more than one or two decimal places in nautical miles, whereas long ocean passages or survey lines spanning hundreds of kilometers may warrant two decimal places when reported in nmi."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between kilometers and nautical miles?",
        "answer": "By international definition, 1 nautical mile is exactly 1,852 meters. Since 1 kilometer is exactly 1,000 meters, 1 kilometer is approximately 0.5399568 nautical miles and 1 nautical mile is approximately 1.852 kilometers. The calculator uses this exact ratio rather than a rounded rule of thumb."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do pilots and mariners use nautical miles instead of kilometers?",
        "answer": "Nautical miles are directly linked to the Earth's latitude grid: one nautical mile corresponds to one minute of latitude. This makes plotting distances on charts and along great-circle routes straightforward. Aviation and maritime standards bodies, flight-planning systems, and nautical charts are built around nautical miles, while kilometers remain the SI unit used in engineering, mapping, and many land-based applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the nautical mile an SI unit?",
        "answer": "No. The nautical mile is not an SI unit, but it is an internationally recognized non-SI unit accepted for use in specialized domains such as marine and air navigation. Metrology references and standards documents list the nautical mile alongside other non-SI units, while defining its exact value in meters so it can be linked consistently to the SI system."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many nautical miles are in a typical route of 100 kilometers?",
        "answer": "Using the international definition, 100 kilometers is about 53.996 nautical miles, often rounded to 54.0 nautical miles in planning documents. For many coastal routes and routine flight segments, reporting to one decimal place in nautical miles is sufficient given the underlying uncertainties in wind, current, and navigation sensors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is this kilometers to nautical miles converter?",
        "answer": "The converter applies the exact ratio implied by 1 nautical mile = 1,852 meters, using high-precision floating-point arithmetic. In practice, the limiting factor is the precision of your input distance and the level of rounding appropriate for your use case. Chart scales, GPS accuracy, and route changes in response to weather can easily introduce variations much larger than the rounding in the calculator output."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where is the 1,852 meter definition of the nautical mile documented?",
        "answer": "The 1,852 meter value for the international nautical mile is documented in NIST guidance on units outside the SI, in NIST Handbook 44 conversion tables, in U.S. and international hydrographic conference proceedings, and in educational material from navigation and oceanographic agencies such as NOAA, as well as in university-level navigation and land-navigation course notes."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I report distances in kilometers versus nautical miles?",
        "answer": "Use nautical miles when working with charts, flight plans, marine navigation systems, or regulatory concepts such as territorial seas and airspace, because the underlying standards and documents are expressed in nautical miles. Use kilometers when you are reporting to audiences that expect SI units, such as engineering teams, many scientific publications, and land-based logistics or accounting systems. This converter helps you switch consistently between the two."

      "Example 1: A coastal survey line of 10 kilometers corresponds to about 5.40 nautical miles, so a hydrographic surveyor might plan waypoints and sounding intervals based on a 5.4 nmi leg.",
      "Example 2: A ferry crossing of 40 kilometers is roughly 21.60 nautical miles; operators may publish the timetable and fuel estimates in nautical miles while port authorities or accountants record route lengths in kilometers.",
      "Example 3: An oceanographic transect of 185.2 kilometers is essentially 100 nautical miles, which is convenient for dividing long routes into equal-century legs in navigation planning.",
