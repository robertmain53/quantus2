    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a distance given in kilometres (kilometers) into international nautical miles. The international nautical mile is defined exactly as 1852 metres and is the standard used in maritime and aviation contexts.",
      "Use this converter for chart reading, flight planning, navigation calculations, or general unit conversion. Results are presented as a direct mathematical conversion; follow the guidance below on rounding and regulatory compliance for operational use."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed using the international nautical mile definition of exactly 1852 metres. One kilometre equals 1000 metres, therefore the exact ratio is 1000/1852 nautical miles per kilometre.",
      "Displayed numeric results are produced from standard IEEE-754 double-precision arithmetic and then rounded for presentation. For formal or regulated workflows, follow the rounding, reporting, and documentation rules required by relevant authorities and standards organizations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition: 1 nautical mile = 1852 metres exactly.",
      "Step 1: Convert kilometres to metres: metres = kilometres × 1000.",
      "Step 2: Convert metres to nautical miles: nautical miles = metres ÷ 1852. Combined formula: nautical miles = kilometres × (1000 ÷ 1852) ≈ kilometres × 0.5399568034557234."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 kilometre → 1 × (1000 ÷ 1852) = 0.5399568034557234 nautical miles. Rounded to three decimals: 0.540 nmi.",
      "Example 2: 10 kilometres → 10 × (1000 ÷ 1852) ≈ 5.399568034557234 nautical miles. Rounded to two decimals for display: 5.40 nmi.",
      "Example 3: 123.456 kilometres → 123.456 × (1000 ÷ 1852) ≈ 66.663 nmi when rounded to three decimal places."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which definition of the nautical mile does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the international nautical mile defined as exactly 1852 metres, which is the standard in aviation and maritime navigation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use for operational navigation?",
        "answer": "Decimal places depend on context. For chart-level distances, two or three decimals are typically sufficient. For precision navigation or instrument flight planning, follow the accuracy and rounding rules in your operational procedures and applicable regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there alternative definitions of the nautical mile?",
        "answer": "Historically other definitions existed, but the internationally accepted definition is 1852 metres. Use the international definition for modern navigation and regulatory compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the accuracy limitations of the calculator?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion uses exact unit definitions but numeric results are subject to floating-point rounding per IEEE-754. For legal, safety-critical, or certified measurements, refer to official instrument calibration records and standards and report values according to the required number of significant figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from nautical miles to kilometres?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the reciprocal factor: kilometres = nautical miles × 1.852. For convenience, use a two-way converter or perform the reciprocal operation as needed."
