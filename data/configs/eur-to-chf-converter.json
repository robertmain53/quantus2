    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts amounts from Euro (EUR) to Swiss Franc (CHF) using a live exchange rate feed. It is intended for quick reference and planning — not a guaranteed transactional quote.",
      "Displayed values reflect the selected exchange rate at the time shown. Actual amounts received in a bank transfer, card payment, or currency exchange may differ because providers typically apply a spread, commissions, or rounding rules."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary rate source: mid-market or reference interbank rates published by central banks and market data providers. For authoritative reference values, see official central bank releases and ISO currency standards.",
      "Displayed conversion = input amount × exchange rate. The tool shows a timestamp for the rate and an indicator whether the rate is a central-bank reference rate or a market (mid) rate.",
      "For practical use, we call out common adjustments: (1) provider spread (percentage added/subtracted from mid rate), (2) fixed fees, and (3) rounding to the smallest currency unit (0.01 CHF). Users can apply manual adjustments if they need an estimate closer to a specific provider's delivered rate."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Obtain the current EUR→CHF mid-market exchange rate (R).",
      "Step 2: Multiply: Amount_CHF = Amount_EUR × R.",
      "Step 3 (optional): Adjust for provider spread or fees: Delivered_CHF ≈ Amount_CHF × (1 - spread) - fees. Round final result to 2 decimal places (smallest CHF cent)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which exchange rate does this converter use?",
        "answer": "The converter uses a live mid-market or central-bank reference rate, depending on the selected feed. The UI shows which feed is in use and the rate timestamp. Transactional providers (banks, money transfer services) commonly apply their own spreads on top of these rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the result differ from my bank or card statement?",
        "answer": "Banks and payment providers add a margin (spread) and may charge a fixed fee. They also may use an internal rate published at a different timestamp. Use the optional spread adjustment described in the methodology to approximate a provider quote."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often are rates updated and what timestamp is shown?",
        "answer": "Rates are refreshed frequently (multiple times per minute for market feeds). The converter displays a timestamp in UTC indicating when the source rate was last updated. For central-bank reference rates, updates occur on the schedule published by that institution."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are conversions and how is rounding handled?",
        "answer": "Calculations use high-precision arithmetic internally. Final displayed amounts are rounded to two decimal places (0.01 CHF), which is the smallest accounting unit for CHF. For large-value transfers, consider professional FX settlement conventions where different rounding may apply."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool compliant with regulated requirements for quoting exchange rates?",
        "answer": "This tool is an indicative calculator for informational use and is not a regulated transaction quote. Regulated quotes are issued by licensed financial institutions and include details about spread, fees, and execution time. For regulatory guidance, consult central bank and financial regulatory documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert historical amounts using a past rate?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the converter's historical-rate option to apply a rate from a specific date. Historical reference rates published by central banks should be used for accounting and tax reporting when required."
