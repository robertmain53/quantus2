    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct unit conversion from the absolute temperature scale (Kelvin, K) to the Fahrenheit scale (°F). The mathematical relationship is fixed and deterministic, so given a numeric Kelvin value the converter returns the corresponding Fahrenheit value immediately.",
      "Although the arithmetic conversion is exact for a numeric value, practical temperature measurements have uncertainty. For measurement and regulatory use, follow calibration and traceability guidance from standards organizations to understand and control uncertainty."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally accepted relationship between Kelvin and Fahrenheit derived from the defined zero points and size of the scales. The International Temperature Scale (ITS-90) defines practical temperature realizations; the converter implements the algebraic conversion between the defined scale values.",
      "For applied and regulated measurements, users should note the distinction between the algebraic conversion and instrument uncertainty. Follow NIST and applicable ISO guidance for thermometer calibration and uncertainty budgets. Workplace exposure and control guidance may reference OSHA limits and standards for measuring and reporting temperatures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: °F = K × 9/5 − 459.67",
      "Step-by-step: 1) multiply the Kelvin value by 9/5 (or 1.8). 2) subtract 459.67 from the result. 3) round to the desired number of significant digits depending on instrument accuracy.",
      "Notes on precision: the numeric constant 459.67 is exact in the conventional conversion between Kelvin and Fahrenheit. Reported precision should reflect measurement instrument uncertainty and calibration records, not excessive digits produced by pure arithmetic."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 0 K → 0 × 9/5 − 459.67 = −459.67 °F (absolute zero in Fahrenheit).",
      "Example 2: 273.15 K → 273.15 × 9/5 − 459.67 = 32.00 °F (freezing point of water).",
      "Example 3: 310.15 K → 310.15 × 9/5 − 459.67 = 98.60 °F (approximate normal human body temperature)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the Kelvin to Fahrenheit conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic conversion using the formula °F = K × 9/5 − 459.67 is exact as a mathematical relationship. For measured temperatures, the reported Fahrenheit value should reflect the measurement uncertainty and calibration state of the sensor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is 459.67 subtracted in the formula?",
        "answer": "459.67 is the offset that converts the Kelvin zero point (absolute zero) to the Fahrenheit scale after scaling by 9/5. It is the conventional constant used for algebraic conversion between K and °F."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative Fahrenheit values from Kelvin?",
        "answer": "Yes. Kelvin values at and above 0 K map to Fahrenheit values down to −459.67 °F. Kelvin cannot be negative for classical thermodynamics; negative Kelvin values are not valid for this converter."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimals should I report?",
        "answer": "Report decimals consistent with the measurement instrument and calibration certificate. For laboratory instruments, two to three decimals may be appropriate; for general reporting one decimal or integer often suffices. Do not imply greater accuracy than the sensor provides."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter handle non-ITS-90 temperature scales or sensor corrections?",
        "answer": "This tool performs a pure unit conversion and does not apply sensor-specific corrections, thermocouple polynomial fits, or ITS-90 realization corrections. Apply device calibration corrections and standard-specific algorithms before or after unit conversion as required by your procedure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about safety and workplace regulations?",
        "answer": "This converter does not replace regulatory guidance. For workplace exposure limits, heat stress assessments, or compliance, consult applicable OSHA guidance and follow accredited measurement and reporting procedures."
