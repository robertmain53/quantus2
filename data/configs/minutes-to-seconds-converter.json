    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a quantity expressed in minutes into the equivalent quantity in seconds using the exact International System of Units (SI) relationship: 1 minute = 60 seconds. It is intended for quick conversions used in scheduling, engineering estimates, education, and scripting.",
      "The converter uses an exact mathematical factor and is suitable for typical numerical ranges encountered in daily and technical use. See the methodology and accuracy notes below if you require sub-millisecond precision, extremely large values, or compliance-level traceability."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed using the fixed SI relationship between minutes and seconds. The definition used is 60 seconds per minute as specified in international unit guidance.",
      "For computational reliability the tool applies standard IEEE-754 double-precision arithmetic where available; numerical rounding follows conventional round-to-nearest rules. When exact integer results are expected (for whole-minute inputs) the conversion yields an exact integer number of seconds.",
      "For auditability and regulatory alignment, this page references national and international documentation on time and units (NIST, ISO) and on numerical/engineering practice (IEEE). For workplace recordkeeping or safety-related timing, consult applicable OSHA provisions and your organizational procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply minutes by 60 to get seconds.",
      "Formula: seconds = minutes × 60.",
      "Example: 2.5 minutes → 2.5 × 60 = 150 seconds."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Input: 1 minute → Output: 60 seconds",
      "Input: 0.5 minute → Output: 30 seconds",
      "Input: 2.75 minutes → Output: 165 seconds"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter applies the exact factor 60 seconds per minute. It is appropriate for general-purpose conversions and many technical tasks.",
      "If you need sub-millisecond accuracy, time-stamping against official time sources, or traceable calibration, follow the accuracy and standards guidance in the FAQs and citations."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship used is exact: 1 minute equals 60 seconds. Results for integer and finite decimal inputs are exact in mathematical terms; computational rounding may affect representation in floating-point environments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the result for very small or very large numbers?",
        "answer": "For typical ranges the result is exact or accurate to machine precision. For extremely large magnitudes or when many chained conversions occur, floating-point rounding (per IEEE-754) can introduce tiny errors. Use high-precision/arbitrary-precision arithmetic libraries when you require strict error bounds."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds are adjustments to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and do not change the fixed mathematical relationship between minutes and seconds used for unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for regulatory or legal recordkeeping?",
        "answer": "This converter is suitable for quick calculations and estimates. For regulated recordkeeping, safety schedules, or legally binding time measurements, follow your organization’s calibration and traceability procedures and consult applicable standards and regulators (for example NIST guidance and OSHA requirements)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where does the definition come from?",
        "answer": "The minute-to-second factor is aligned with international unit conventions as reflected in SI and national metrology organizations. See the provided citations to official standards and guidance for authoritative definitions."
