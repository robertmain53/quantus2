    "introduction": [
      "Convert minutes to seconds instantly for schedules, workouts, audio/video timing, or lab intervals without manual math.",
      "The converter uses the exact 60:1 minute-to-second definition maintained by NIST and ISO, keeping logs and reports consistent across devices and standards.",
      "Lightweight controls and clear labels make it easy to sanity-check timers before you record or publish results."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Time units follow SI guidance: 1 minute is defined as 60 seconds, with the second derived from the cesium frequency standard (NIST, BIPM).",
      "The calculator multiplies the entered minutes by 60 to return seconds, matching ISO 80000-3 unit conventions used in science, aviation, and broadcast timing.",
      "We recommend aligning device settings (stopwatch, interval timer, or lab logger) to the same unit scheme before recording, per NIST Time and Frequency guidance."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "7.5 minutes → 450 seconds, useful for timing a short workout interval.",
      "1 minute → 60 seconds, matching standard stopwatch readouts.",
      "0.25 minutes → 15 seconds, helpful for audio clip trims or metronome settings."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the 60:1 ratio exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition, 1 minute equals exactly 60 seconds per NIST and ISO time standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I enter fractional minutes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Fractional minutes are multiplied by 60 to return fractional seconds, which is useful for audio edits and interval training."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does leap second handling affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds affect UTC clock corrections, not the base definition that 1 minute = 60 seconds."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I note the unit in reports?",
        "answer": "Record both the numeric value and the unit (seconds) and, for compliance, state that you used the SI-derived 60:1 minute-second relationship."
