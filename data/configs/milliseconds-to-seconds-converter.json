    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a numeric value expressed in milliseconds (ms) into seconds (s). The relationship between the units is exact: 1 second equals 1,000 milliseconds.",
      "Use this converter for quick unit changes in engineering calculations, logs, performance metrics, or when preparing data for systems that require seconds. The tool reports exact mathematical results; minor differences can arise from numeric rounding when displayed or exported."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed mathematical relationship defined by the SI-derived time units: 1 s = 1000 ms. The calculation is performed using precise arithmetic (division by 1000) and then formatted for display according to typical decimal rounding conventions.",
      "For technical or regulatory usage, be aware of numeric representation and rounding. Floating-point representations follow IEEE 754 semantics in most implementations; if you require traceable timekeeping or timestamp alignment, follow NIST and ISO guidance on time standards and timestamp formats."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the input value in milliseconds.",
      "Step 2: Divide the millisecond value by 1000.",
      "Formula: seconds = milliseconds / 1000",
      "Example rounding guidance: format results to the number of decimal places required by your context (for many engineering use cases 3 to 6 decimals are common; for timestamps use ISO 8601 formatting and required precision)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1500 ms → 1.5 s",
      "0 ms → 0 s",
      "123456 ms → 123.456 s",
      "-250 ms → -0.25 s (negative values are valid when representing offsets or relative times)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship used is exact: seconds = milliseconds / 1000. Any deviation comes from how numbers are represented or rounded in the client or downstream systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I display?",
        "answer": "Display precision depends on your application. For human-readable outputs, 3 decimal places (milliseconds precision) is common. For performance metrics or scientific work, choose precision that preserves required significance; document the rounding method and number of decimals."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small numbers?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion scales linearly. Be mindful of the numeric limits of your environment (integer overflow or floating-point range). For extremely large integers use arbitrary-precision arithmetic if available."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this handle timestamps and time zones?",
        "answer": "This converter only converts a numeric duration between milliseconds and seconds. Converting absolute timestamps, accounting for time zones, daylight saving, or calendar conversions requires additional context and should follow ISO 8601 formatting and timekeeping best practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards considerations?",
        "answer": "For traceable time measurement and synchronization, follow NIST and IEEE standards for time and frequency, and represent timestamps using ISO 8601 when exchanging time data. Document rounding and representation choices for auditability."
