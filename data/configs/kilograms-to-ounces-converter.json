    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts mass in kilograms to ounces using the international avoirdupois ounce definition. It is intended for general use such as recipe scaling, shipping estimates, and quick engineering checks.",
      "For high accuracy needs such as legal trade, laboratory work, or regulatory compliance, use properly calibrated instruments and follow applicable standards. The tool reports a mathematical conversion; it does not account for measurement error, scale calibration offsets, or environmental factors that affect weighing devices."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the internationally accepted definitions linking the kilogram and the avoirdupois ounce. One avoirdupois ounce is defined as exactly 28.349523125 grams and one kilogram is defined as exactly 1000 grams.",
      "We derive the factor by dividing 1000 grams per kilogram by 28.349523125 grams per ounce to obtain the multiplier from kilograms to ounces. This implementation uses a double-precision numeric factor and returns results rounded according to typical significant-figure guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply kilograms by the fixed factor 35.27396194958041 to obtain avoirdupois ounces",
      "Formula: ounces = kilograms × 35.27396194958041",
      "For the reverse conversion divide ounces by 35.27396194958041 or multiply by 0.028349523125",
      "Note: this uses the avoirdupois ounce. Troy and other historical ounce definitions are different and are not used here"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: 2.5 kg × 35.27396194958041 = 88.18490487395103 oz, commonly rounded to 88.1849 oz for four decimal places",
      "Example: 0.01 kg × 35.27396194958041 = 0.3527396194958041 oz, useful for small-mass conversions"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which ounce does this converter use",
        "answer": "This converter uses the avoirdupois ounce defined as exactly 28.349523125 grams. It does not convert to or from troy ounces or other historical ounce definitions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep",
        "answer": "Keep as many significant figures as justified by your input measurement. For laboratory or trade work follow the precision of your calibrated instrument and relevant standards. For casual use 3 to 6 significant figures are typically sufficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the result legally valid for trade or lab reporting",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides mathematical conversion only. Legal trade, medical dosing, and laboratory reporting require certified measuring devices and compliance with standards such as NIST Handbook 44 and applicable local regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do measurement errors and calibration affect conversions",
        "answer": "Measurement error and calibration offsets are properties of the measuring instrument, not the conversion factor. Always calibrate scales regularly, log calibration certificates, and account for instrument uncertainty when reporting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I need very high numeric accuracy in software",
        "answer": "Use appropriate numeric types and libraries that support the required precision. For binary floating point beware of rounding errors; for exact decimal arithmetic use decimal or arbitrary precision libraries. Follow IEEE 754 guidance where applicable for floating point behavior."
