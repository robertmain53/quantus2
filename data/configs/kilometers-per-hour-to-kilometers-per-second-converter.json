    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a speed value in kilometers per hour (km/h) to kilometers per second (km/s). The relationship between these units is fixed and exact within the International System of Units (SI).",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversions, engineering checks, data logging normalization, and documentation. See the methodology and calibration notes below for guidance on precision, rounding, and measurement uncertainty when using converted values in regulated or safety-critical contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a direct unit-to-unit transformation based on time scaling: 1 hour equals 3600 seconds. Therefore the conversion factor is exact in SI arithmetic and requires only a division by 3600.",
      "For numeric implementation we recommend using double-precision arithmetic and reporting results with an appropriate number of significant figures based on input measurement uncertainty. For laboratory or instrument-derived values follow calibration and measurement best practices described in ISO/IEC 17025 and guidance from national metrology institutes.",
      "When presenting converted values in reports or safety documents, include the original measurement, the conversion formula used, and an explicit statement about the numerical precision and any known measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: km/s = km/h ÷ 3600",
      "Step 1: Take the numeric speed in kilometers per hour. Step 2: Divide that number by 3600. Step 3: Round or format the result according to required significant figures or the instrument uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 90 km/h → 90 ÷ 3600 = 0.025 km/s",
      "Example 2: 1 km/h → 1 ÷ 3600 = 0.0002777777777777778 km/s (report as 0.00027778 km/s if rounding to 8 significant digits)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between km/h and km/s?",
        "answer": "1 hour = 3600 seconds, so km/s = km/h divided by 3600. The mathematical relationship is exact; any deviation in practice comes from measurement uncertainty or rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report significant figures consistent with the precision of the original measurement. If the input is from a calibrated instrument with known uncertainty, round the converted result to reflect that uncertainty. Refer to ISO/IEC 17025 for laboratory reporting and NIST guidance for SI usage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there pitfalls with very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Floating-point representation can introduce rounding at extreme magnitudes. For most practical speed values typical in transport and engineering, double-precision arithmetic is sufficient. For scientific contexts that require extreme dynamic range, use appropriate numeric types and include uncertainty analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool perform any calibration or measurement validation?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a mathematical unit conversion only. Calibration, instrument validation, and uncertainty estimation must be performed separately in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 and relevant workplace safety standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert other speed units here?",
        "answer": "This configuration is specifically for km/h to km/s. For other unit conversions, use the corresponding converters that implement the standard SI relationships and conversion factors."
