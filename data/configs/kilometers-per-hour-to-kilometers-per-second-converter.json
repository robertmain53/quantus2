    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a speed value expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h) to kilometers per second (km/s) using the exact fixed relationship between hours and seconds. The conversion is purely mathematical and does not alter the underlying measurement uncertainty of the input value.",
      "The converter is intended for engineering, scientific, and everyday use where straightforward unit conversion is required. For traceable measurements or safety-critical use, follow instrument calibration, measurement uncertainty reporting, and relevant industry standards described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the defined time relationship 1 hour = 3,600 seconds, which is part of the International System of Units (SI). No approximations beyond standard floating-point arithmetic are required for the conversion itself.",
      "When reporting converted results, preserve appropriate significant figures based on the original measurement's uncertainty and instrument calibration. For high-precision requirements, consult guidance on measurement uncertainty and calibration from recognized authorities such as NIST and relevant ISO standards.",
      "Computational implementations should be aware of numeric limits (floating-point precision, underflow for extremely small values, overflow for extremely large values) and handle formatting and rounding according to the target application's needs."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: speed_km_per_s = speed_km_per_h ÷ 3600",
      "Equivalent factor: 1 km/h = 1/3600 km/s = 0.0002777777777777778 km/s",
      "Step-by-step: take the input in km/h, divide by 3600, round the result to the correct number of significant digits consistent with input uncertainty"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 km/h → 0.0002777777777777778 km/s (1 ÷ 3600)",
      "90 km/h → 0.025 km/s (90 ÷ 3600 = 0.025 exactly to three decimal places)",
      "12345.6 km/h → 3.4293333333333334 km/s (12345.6 ÷ 3600); adjust reported digits according to input precision"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor is used?",
        "answer": "The exact factor is 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so km/s = km/h ÷ 3600. Numerically, 1 km/h = 0.0002777777777777778 km/s when expressed in double-precision floating point."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I display?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the uncertainty of your original measurement. Do not imply greater precision than the source. For instrument measurements, follow calibration certificates and report uncertainty per NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion handle very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion does, but software implementations are limited by numeric types. Use arbitrary-precision libraries if you require extreme ranges or exact rational arithmetic to avoid floating-point rounding or underflow."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion reversible?",
        "answer": "Yes. To convert back: km/h = km/s × 3600. Reversibility is exact in rational arithmetic; floating-point results may differ by rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to account for relativistic effects?",
        "answer": "No for everyday speeds. Relativistic corrections are only relevant near a significant fraction of the speed of light and are outside the scope of simple unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document uncertainty and calibration?",
        "answer": "Record the instrument, calibration date, calibration standard, and the measurement uncertainty. Follow guidance from national metrology institutes and ISO standards when reporting results in technical or regulatory contexts."
