    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a value expressed in bits (b) into gibibytes (GiB), the binary unit defined by the IEC where 1 GiB = 2^30 bytes.",
      "Use it when you need power-of-two accuracy for operating systems, file systems, memory sizing, or technical documentation that explicitly requires binary prefixes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Core identity: 1 byte = 8 bits. Binary prefixes: 1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30).",
      "Conversion path: bits → bytes (÷8) → GiB (÷1,073,741,824). Combined factor: GiB = bits ÷ (8 × 1,073,741,824).",
      "If you instead need decimal gigabytes (GB), use the decimal factor 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes; the bit-to-byte step remains ÷8."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: gibibytes = bits ÷ (8 × 1,073,741,824).",
      "Example: 8,589,934,592 bits → 8,589,934,592 ÷ (8 × 1,073,741,824) = 1 GiB.",
      "Comparison: the same bit value would be 1.073741824 GB under decimal prefixes."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "4,294,967,296 bits → 0.5 GiB.",
      "17,179,869,184 bits → 2 GiB.",
      "80,000,000,000 bits → 80,000,000,000 ÷ (8 × 1,073,741,824) ≈ 9.313 GiB."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why use GiB instead of GB?",
        "answer": "GiB is a binary unit (powers of two) and is unambiguous for software, memory, and file systems. GB is decimal (powers of ten) and is common in marketing and some specs. Pick the unit that matches your documentation or regulatory requirement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the bit-to-byte factor always 8?",
        "answer": "Yes. Modern byte definitions are 8 bits. The difference between GB and GiB arises from the prefixes (10^9 vs 2^30), not from the bit-to-byte relationship."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the output?",
        "answer": "Keep full precision internally. Round for display to the number of decimals needed by your report or SLA—often 2–4 decimals for summaries, more for engineering detail."
