    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a volume value expressed in litres (L) into gallons. It is intended for general-purpose use where a reliable fixed mathematical conversion is required, such as recipes, vehicle fuel estimates, laboratory notes, or rough inventory calculations.",
      "Be aware there are different gallon definitions in common use (for example US liquid gallon and Imperial gallon). The numeric conversion factor differs by definition; consult the methodology and FAQs below to choose the correct gallon standard for your needs."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the internationally recognized fixed mathematical relationship between the two units. For the US liquid gallon the exact multiplicative factor used is 0.2641720523581484 when converting from litres to US liquid gallons.",
      "When a different gallon definition is required (for example the Imperial gallon), use the corresponding factor. This implementation assumes a single conversion target unit ID; verify which gallon type is selected in the UI or settings before applying results to regulatory or safety-critical work.",
      "Results are subject to rounding and measurement uncertainty. For high-accuracy requirements reference national measurement standards and ensure instruments are calibrated per NIST guidance and applicable ISO or local standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Identify the litre value you want to convert.",
      "Step 2: Select the gallon definition required (US liquid gallon or Imperial gallon).",
      "Step 3: Apply the multiplication factor: gallons = litres × conversion_factor.",
      "Example conversion factors: US liquid gallon factor = 0.2641720523581484; Imperial gallon factor = 0.2199692483000000.",
      "Round the final result according to the number of significant figures required for your application; include measurement uncertainty when reporting for technical or compliance purposes."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5 L × 0.2641720523581484 = 1.320860261790742 US gallons (approx. 1.321 gal when rounded to three decimal places).",
      "10 L × 0.2199692483 = 2.199692483 Imperial gallons (approx. 2.200 gal when rounded to three decimal places)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which gallon does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "The logic uses the target unit ID provided by the UI. Common implementations default to US liquid gallons; confirm the UI label or settings to ensure you are converting to the intended gallon definition. See methodology and examples for both US and Imperial values."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The conversion applies an exact mathematical multiplier for the chosen gallon definition. However, practical accuracy depends on the precision of the input value and measurement uncertainty of the instrument that produced it. For regulatory or laboratory work include uncertainty estimates and follow NIST and ISO calibration guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use the Imperial gallon instead of the US gallon?",
        "answer": "Use the Imperial gallon when working with sources or regulations from countries that define the gallon that way, historically British contexts, or documents that explicitly state 'Imperial gallon'. For the United States use the US liquid gallon. Check the source or specification when in doubt."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use converted volumes for billing, shipping, or safety reporting?",
        "answer": "Converted values are suitable for operational use, but when used in billing, legal documentation, safety data sheets, or regulated reporting, confirm the required unit definition, rounding rules, and whether measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration certificates must be attached in accordance with applicable standards and workplace regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report significant figures and uncertainty?",
        "answer": "Report results with a number of significant figures appropriate to the precision of your original measurement. For technical reporting include an uncertainty estimate and reference calibration; follow guidance in NIST publications and ISO standards for expressing measurement uncertainty."
