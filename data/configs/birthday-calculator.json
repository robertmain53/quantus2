      "This Birthday & Age Calculator computes age from a provided date of birth to a specified reference date. Default reference values are provided for convenience but may be changed for historical or projection scenarios.",
      "Outputs include age in full years, total months, an approximate count of days, and an approximate countdown to the next birthday. Results are intended for general civil use (ID verification, eligibility checks, personal information) rather than legal or medical certification."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Age in years is computed using civil calendar arithmetic: the difference in years between reference and birth year, minus one when the reference month/day is earlier than the birth month/day. This aligns with common legal and administrative definitions of age.",
      "Total months equals years times 12 plus the month difference, adjusted down by one month when the reference day is before the birth day.",
      "Approximate days are calculated using a 365-day base plus leap-year corrections (Gregorian rules). Months are approximated as 30 days for summary outputs. For precise day counts use a dedicated date-duration tool that accounts for exact month lengths and calendar transitions.",
      "Accuracy notes: this tool uses civil (Gregorian) rules and integer arithmetic. It does not account for time zones, time-of-day, fractional seconds, or leap-second insertions. For high-integrity applications consult standards and authoritative time sources."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Age in years equals reference year minus birth year, minus one when the reference month and day occur before the birth month and day.",
      "Age in total months equals (reference year minus birth year) times 12 plus the month difference, minus one month when the reference day is before the birth day.",
      "Age in approximate days equals years difference times 365 plus leap-year corrections plus month difference times 30 plus day difference. Leap-year corrections follow Gregorian rules: add a day for each year divisible by 4, subtract a day for those divisible by 100, add a day for those divisible by 400 within the interval.",
      "Days until next birthday (approximate) uses calendar-month estimates; for exact intervals use a date-duration calculator that counts actual month lengths."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this calculation exact to the day?",
        "answer": "The years and months calculation follows civil calendar rules and is exact for those units. The 'approximate days' and 'days until next birthday' outputs use month/day approximations for summary purposes. For exact day counts use a dedicated date-duration calculation that counts exact month lengths and accounts for calendar transitions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for time zones and leap seconds?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs civil-date arithmetic (year, month, day) and does not consider time-of-day, time zones, or leap-second events. For timestamp-level precision consult authoritative time services and NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which calendar does this use?",
        "answer": "This tool assumes the proleptic Gregorian calendar for all years. For historical dates prior to Gregorian adoption or for non-Gregorian calendars, use a calendar-aware conversion tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I calculate age on a past or future reference date?",
        "answer": "Yes. Change the reference date fields to compute age as of any given date, useful for retrospective verification or future eligibility planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I use these results for legal or medical decisions?",
        "answer": "Treat results as informational. For legal, medical, or compliance decisions require authoritative documentation and, where required, certified date calculations or practitioner confirmation."
