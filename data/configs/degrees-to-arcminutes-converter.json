    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts plane angle values from degrees (°) to arcminutes (′) and vice versa. Use it for tasks in surveying, navigation, astronomy, cartography, and any application where angular subdivisions are required.",
      "The conversion follows standard unit definitions used in scientific and government references: one degree equals sixty arcminutes. Results are presented with clear rounding guidance and notes on instrument resolution and measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the exact arithmetic relationship between the units: 1 degree = 60 arcminutes. The converter performs a straightforward multiplication or division using IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic and then formats the displayed value according to common precision needs.",
      "For high-precision requirements (surveying, astrometry), consider instrument resolution and calibration error before relying on the converted value as a measurement. When converting values measured in degrees, include the measurement uncertainty from your instrument or procedure; rounding alone does not account for systematic error.",
      "When converting formatted sexagesimal inputs (degrees, minutes, seconds), first convert those to decimal degrees (degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600), then convert to arcminutes. Conversely, to present arcminutes as DMS, divide to produce degrees and residual minutes/seconds."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "To convert degrees to arcminutes: arcminutes = degrees × 60.",
      "To convert arcminutes to degrees: degrees = arcminutes ÷ 60.",
      "Example: 2.5 degrees → 2.5 × 60 = 150 arcminutes. Example reverse: 90 arcminutes → 90 ÷ 60 = 1.5 degrees."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 12.345° to arcminutes: 12.345 × 60 = 740.7′.",
      "Convert 3600′ to degrees: 3600 ÷ 60 = 60°."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is an arcminute?",
        "answer": "An arcminute (symbol ′) is 1/60 of a degree. It is a unit used to express small angular distances in navigation, mapping, and astronomy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this relate to arcseconds?",
        "answer": "One arcminute equals 60 arcseconds (1′ = 60″). Therefore 1 degree = 60′ = 3600″."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I display?",
        "answer": "Display as many digits as your measurement uncertainty warrants. For coarse work, 1–2 decimal places in arcminutes is usually sufficient; for precision surveying or astronomy, preserve more digits and include instrument uncertainty from calibration records."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert sexagesimal (D° M′ S″) inputs?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert D° M′ S″ to decimal degrees first: decimal_degrees = D + M/60 + S/3600. Then convert decimal degrees to arcminutes by multiplying by 60."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for instrument calibration or measurement error?",
        "answer": "No — this converter performs exact unit arithmetic only. For measurements, combine this conversion with your instrument's stated uncertainty, calibration certificates, or standard operating procedures before making decisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are degrees SI units?",
        "answer": "The radian is the SI coherent unit for plane angle; the degree is an accepted non-SI unit for use with the SI. The numerical relationship used here (1° = 60′) is exact and independent of SI conventions."
