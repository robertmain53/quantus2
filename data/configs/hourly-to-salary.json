      "This tool converts an hourly wage into an equivalent annual salary and provides related measures such as employer total cost and estimated take-home pay. It uses configurable assumptions for hours, overtime, benefits, payroll taxes, and income tax to reflect different employment scenarios.",
      "Use the fields to match your situation: enter your hourly rate, typical weekly hours, any consistent overtime, and the percentages you expect for employer-paid benefits and taxes. The calculator gives transparent intermediate values so you can audit assumptions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations are deterministic arithmetic based on user inputs. The tool separates regular pay, overtime pay, employer-paid benefits, payroll taxes, and a simple single-rate income tax to produce gross and net estimates.",
      "This calculator is intended for planning and estimation. It does not replace payroll software or official tax calculators. For employer compliance, payroll withholding, and labor classification consult relevant federal and local regulations and your payroll provider."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Annual regular pay = hourly_rate × hours_per_week × weeks_per_year",

      "Total annual gross pay = annual regular pay + annual overtime pay",

    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $20/hour, 40 hours/week, 52 weeks → Annual salary = $20 × 40 × 52 = $41,600.",
      "Example 2: $30/hour, 40 regular hours + 5 overtime hours at 1.5×, benefits 20%, payroll taxes 8% → Gross = regular + overtime; Employer cost adds benefits and payroll taxes on top of gross."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use 52 or 50 weeks per year?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculate exact tax withholding?",
        "answer": "No. The take-home estimate uses a single user-specified income tax percentage and does not model progressive tax brackets, deductions, Social Security, Medicare, or state/local withholding. Use official tax calculators or payroll services for precise withholding."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I set employer benefits percent?",
        "answer": "Employer benefits percent should capture the employer's annual cost for health insurance, retirement contributions, paid leave, and other benefits as a share of salary. If unsure, common estimates range from 15% to 30% depending on benefit offerings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is overtime automatically included?",
        "answer": "Only if you provide an overtime_hours_per_week value or adjust the overtime_multiplier. If overtime_hours_per_week is zero, the calculation assumes no overtime."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this be used for classification of salaried vs hourly workers?",
        "answer": "This tool provides pay-equivalence estimates only. Legal classification depends on labor law tests and duties, not pay conversion. Consult labor regulations and legal counsel for classification decisions."
