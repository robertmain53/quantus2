    "introduction": [
      "This estimator provides non-binding premium estimates for common insurance categories: auto, term life, individual health (subsidy-adjusted), and commercial equipment. The tool is designed for planning and budgeting, not for underwriting or issuing coverage.",
      "Estimates are produced from simplified actuarial-style formulas that use the inputs you provide. Actual premiums require underwriting, detailed risk classification, and may include fees, taxes, and discounts not modeled here. Use results only as indicative guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Each method uses a transparent, arithmetic model combining exposure (value or coverage amount), base rate assumptions, and multiplicative risk factors. Models are intentionally conservative and simplified to be explainable and auditable.",
      "Security and data handling recommendations follow NIST and ISO guidance: sensitive inputs must be treated per NIST SP 800-53 controls and ISO/IEC 27001 principles when stored or transmitted. Results that reference program eligibility (for example, health subsidies) are approximations and do not substitute official enrollment systems."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Auto: premium ≈ base_rate_per_1000 × (vehicle_value / 1,000) × risk_score × location_multiplier.",
      "Term life: annual premium ≈ (coverage_amount / 1,000) × base_rate_per_1000 × age_factor × smoker_multiplier, divided across the term as a budgeting figure.",
      "Health (subsidy estimate): monthly premium ≈ benchmark_premium × (1 − subsidy_share), where subsidy_share is a simplified function of household income and family size and is clamped to a plausible range.",
      "Commercial equipment: premium ≈ (equipment_value / 1,000) × rate_per_1000. Underwriting adjustments for usage, location, and business class are not modeled."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: A $20,000 vehicle with average location factor (1.0), no driver points, and 12,000 annual miles: exposure = 20; base rate $8 → estimated annual premium ≈ $8 × 20 × (risk_score close to 1) = ~$160.",
      "Example: Term life for a 35-year-old non-smoker, $250,000 coverage, 20-year term: base rate $0.5 per $1,000 → annual ≈ (250 × 0.5) × age_multiplier ≈ $125–$200 depending on age multiplier and smoker status."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Outputs are estimates only. Use them to compare scenarios, test sensitivity (change a single input), and prepare questions for licensed agents or brokers.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Are these premiums exact or binding?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the subsidy estimates for health insurance?",
        "answer": "They are simplified approximations based on household income and family size and should be used only for budgeting. Official subsidy calculations are state-specific and use program rules not fully replicated here."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I treat the results for commercial underwriting?",
        "answer": "For commercial equipment, treat the result as a starting quote. Full underwriting will consider business class, storage and usage patterns, loss history, and legal requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What privacy and security practices should I expect?",
        "answer": "Data handling should follow NIST SP 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001 guidance. Do not enter sensitive personal identifiers unless you trust the hosting site and understand their privacy policy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I calibrate the base rates to my carrier or broker quotes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Change the base rate and rate-per-1,000 fields to align model outputs with known premiums. The tool is designed to be transparent so you can calibrate parameters for local accuracy."
