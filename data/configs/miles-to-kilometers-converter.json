    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts distances expressed in statute miles to kilometres. The conversion uses the internationally agreed definitions of the metre and mile: one international statute mile equals exactly 1,609.344 metres, and one kilometre equals exactly 1,000 metres, therefore 1 mile = 1.609344 kilometres.",
      "The numeric multiplication factor is exact from the unit definitions; however, any measurement you enter may carry uncertainty from the instrument or source. This page explains the exact relationship, recommended rounding and significant-figure guidance, and compliance references for engineering and metrology."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the fixed mathematical relationship derived from SI and international length definitions: kilometres = miles × 1.609344. This multiplier follows from the definition of the international statute mile as 1,609.344 metres and the kilometre as 1,000 metres.",
      "Although the conversion factor is exact, good practice is to consider measurement uncertainty and significant figures when reporting converted values. For metrology and calibration guidance, follow national metrology bureau recommendations and ISO standards for reporting measurement uncertainty.",
      "For engineering contexts, use an appropriate numeric precision consistent with the device accuracy and project tolerances. Where computations feed safety-critical systems, follow the applicable IEEE and OSHA guidance relevant to that domain for validation, traceability, and documentation."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with input in miles.",
      "Step 2: Multiply by the exact conversion factor: 1 mile = 1.609344 km.",
      "Formula: kilometres = miles × 1.609344.",
      "Rounding guidance: choose displayed decimals to match input measurement precision. Example: if input is measured to 0.1 mi, display converted result to no more precision than justified (typically 3 significant digits)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 mile → 1 × 1.609344 = 1.609344 km (reporting may round to 1.609 km or 1.61 km depending on significant-figure rules).",
      "Example 2: 5 miles → 5 × 1.609344 = 8.04672 km (round to 8.047 km for 6 significant digits, or 8.05 km for 3 significant digits).",
      "Example 3: 100 miles → 100 × 1.609344 = 160.9344 km (report to 160.93 km if input was accurate to 0.01 mi)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The factor 1.609344 is exact based on the definitions 1 mile = 1,609.344 metres and 1 kilometre = 1,000 metres. Any approximation arises from rounding for display or from uncertainty in the measured input value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a statute mile and a nautical mile?",
        "answer": "A statute mile (used on land) is exactly 1,609.344 metres. A nautical mile is a different unit used in marine and aviation contexts and equals exactly 1,852 metres. Do not use the statute-mile conversion factor for nautical miles."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match displayed decimals to the precision of your input measurement and the needs of your application. For general use 2–3 decimal places are typical; for navigation or engineering calculations, use enough digits to preserve required tolerances and consider significant-figure and uncertainty rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small distances with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, but be aware of numeric precision limits in the environment performing the calculation. For extremely large or precise values, use high-precision numeric libraries and retain sufficient significant figures to avoid rounding errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "The conversion itself is exact; the tool does not automatically estimate measurement uncertainty or calibration error. For traceable measurements and uncertainty estimation, follow national metrology guidance and ISO standards on reporting uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for regulatory or safety reporting?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is correct, but for regulatory or safety reporting you must follow the specific standards, calibration traceability, and documentation requirements applicable to your industry, including relevant OSHA, ISO, and IEEE guidance where applicable."
