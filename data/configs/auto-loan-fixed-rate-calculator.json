    "introduction": [
      "This fixed-rate auto loan calculator estimates the monthly payment, total amount paid, and total interest for a straightforward fixed-rate installment loan. It includes sales tax and one-time fees in the financed amount when calculating payments.",
      "Use the fields to enter the vehicle price, down payment and trade-in, any fees, the annual interest rate (APR), and the loan term in months. Results are numerical estimates intended for planning and comparison, not a guarantee of loan terms."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator applies standard amortizing-loan mathematics: a fixed monthly rate derived from the annual rate (APR/12) and the annuity payment formula for level payments. Sales tax and one-time fees are added to the financed amount unless paid separately.",
      "We follow numerical best practices by anchoring calculations to IEEE floating-point principles for arithmetic stability and recommending verification against lender disclosures. Outputs are rounded for presentation but underlying math uses full-precision arithmetic where supported."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Financed principal = vehicle_price - down_payment - trade_in + fees + (vehicle_price × sales_tax_rate / 100).",
      "Monthly rate = annual_rate / 100 / 12.",
      "Monthly payment = if annual_rate equals 0 then financed_principal ÷ term_months else financed_principal × monthly_rate ÷ (1 − (1 + monthly_rate)^(−term_months)).",
      "Total paid = monthly payment × term_months. Total interest = total paid − financed principal."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator use APR or nominal interest rate?",
        "answer": "Enter the annual percentage rate (APR) as provided by the lender. APR reflects the nominal rate; this calculator uses the APR to compute periodic interest compounded monthly. It does not add other annualized fees into APR unless you include them in 'fees'."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will rounding affect the result?",
        "answer": "Displayed numbers are rounded for clarity. Under the hood calculations assume full floating-point precision; minor cent-level differences can occur when lenders apply per-payment rounding or different compounding/period conventions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I model a 0% interest offer?",
        "answer": "Set Annual interest rate (APR) to 0. The calculator will compute equal principal payments: financed principal divided by the number of months."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does sales tax always get financed?",
        "answer": "By default this tool adds sales tax on the vehicle price to the financed amount. If you plan to pay sales tax up front, set 'sales tax rate' to 0 or subtract the tax from financed amounts before using the tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this a loan approval or an offer?",
        "answer": "No. This is an estimation tool only. Final loan terms, fees, and APR are determined by lenders and contractual disclosures."
