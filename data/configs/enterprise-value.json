    "introduction": [
      "Enterprise Value (EV or TEV) represents the total value of a company attributable to all providers of capital: equity holders, debt holders and other claimants. It is commonly used for valuation comparisons, takeover premiums, and as the numerator in valuation multiples.",
      "This calculator supports three common methods: market approach (market capitalization plus net debt and adjustments), the EBITDA multiple approach (EV = EBITDA × multiple), and a sum-of-parts approach. Use the method that best matches your available data and purpose, and record assumptions when presenting results."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Market approach: start from market capitalization (public companies) and add claim items (total debt, minority interest, preferred stock), subtract cash, and apply one‑time or recurring adjustments. This reflects amount attributable to all capital providers.",
      "Multiple approach: apply an appropriate EV/EBITDA multiple to an EBITDA figure that has been selected and, if needed, normalized for one‑offs. Choose multiples from comparable companies or transaction precedents and document the source and date.",
      "Sum-of-parts: value each operating segment and non‑operating assets independently, aggregate the parts, then include or exclude liabilities consistently with how parts were valued."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Market approach formula: EV = market_cap + total_debt + minority_interest + preferred_stock + other_noncontrolling_interest - cash_and_equivalents + (adjustments_positive - adjustments_negative).",
      "Multiple approach formula: EV = EBITDA × (EV/EBITDA multiple) + (adjustments_positive - adjustments_negative).",
      "Sum-of-parts formula: EV = sum_of_part_values + (adjustments_positive - adjustments_negative)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example (market approach): Market cap $500m + total debt $120m + minority interest $10m + preferred $0 - cash $30m = $600m (before adjustments).",
      "Example (multiple approach): EBITDA $50m × multiple 8 = $400m. Add/subtract adjustments like non-operating cash or pension deficits to reconcile to final EV."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use reported debt or enterprise value‑adjusted debt?",
        "answer": "Use the debt measure consistent with your valuation approach. Reported total debt is common; for financial transactions you may use net borrowings, off‑balance sheet obligations, lease liabilities or present value of pensions. Document any adjustments and, if material, perform sensitivity checks."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I choose an EV/EBITDA multiple?",
        "answer": "Select peers or precedent transactions with similar growth, margin profile, and capital intensity. Ensure the EBITDA basis (reported vs. normalized) matches how multiples were derived. Run sensitivity ranges to show valuation dependence on the multiple."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are minority interest and preferred stock always added?",
        "answer": "Yes, to reflect claims on enterprise value they are typically added. The objective is to measure value available to all capital providers before isolating equity value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common pitfalls?",
        "answer": "Mixing incompatible bases (using reported EBITDA with transaction multiples that were based on normalized EBITDA), omitting lease liabilities or pension deficits, and failing to document one‑time adjustments. Always reconcile to audited financial statements where possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
        "answer": "This tool computes EV from inputs using standard formulas. Accuracy depends entirely on the correctness and consistency of your inputs and assumptions. Use outputs for indicative analysis and stress‑test key assumptions; do not rely on a single-point estimate for transaction pricing or regulatory filings."
