    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates periodic payments for a boat loan that includes a balloon payment at the end of the loan term. It supports bi-weekly payments (26/year) by default and also allows other frequencies. Use the two modes to either compute the periodic payment for a given balloon or compute the balloon required for a desired periodic payment.",
      "The tool provides totals and estimated interest to help you compare alternatives and plan refinancing or payoff strategies. Results are mathematical estimates and do not replace lender quotes or signed loan documents."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard loan mathematics for level (constant) periodic payments with a specified future value (balloon). The formulas derive from time-value-of-money relationships for annuities and future values.",
      "We follow safe numeric practices for financial calculations, including using periodic interest rates (APR divided by payments per year) and counting the total number of periodic payments as term years times payments per year. Rounding follows IEEE floating-point convention; implementation should use a stable numeric library and validate results against known examples during QA consistent with ISO 9001 processes. For integrity and reproducibility, follow NIST guidelines for computational reproducibility and IEEE 754 for numeric behavior."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate = APR / 100 / payments_per_year.",
      "Number of payments N = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Payment given balloon (A) is computed from: A = [r * (PV - FV * (1+r)^(-N))] / [1 - (1+r)^(-N)] where PV is loan principal, FV is the balloon (future value), r is periodic_rate, and N is total_payments.",
      "Balloon required for a target payment is computed by rearranging the present-value equation: FV = (PV - A * (1 - (1+r)^(-N)) / r) * (1+r)^N.",
      "Total paid = periodic_payment * N + balloon_amount. Total interest = total paid - principal."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $50,000 loan, 6.5% APR, 5 years, bi-weekly (26). With a 20% balloon ($10,000), the calculator returns the bi-weekly payment and totals.",
      "Example 2: Same loan and term but you want to limit bi-weekly payments to $300; use the 'compute balloon from payment' mode to see the balloon required to achieve that payment."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include fees, taxes, or insurance?",
        "answer": "No. This tool calculates interest and payments based on principal, APR, term, and balloon. Add any fees, taxes, or insurance to the financed amount before using the calculator if you want them included."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might the lender's quote differ from this calculator?",
        "answer": "Lenders may use different APR definitions, include fees rolled into finance charges, use daily-interest accrual, or round payments differently. Always compare to the lender's amortization schedule and disclosure documents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is bi-weekly shown as 26 payments per year?",
        "answer": "Bi-weekly payments are every two weeks, typically resulting in 26 payments per calendar year. Some lenders use semi-monthly schedules (24 payments); choose the frequency that matches your loan contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Results are mathematically accurate to standard floating-point precision, but are estimates. For regulatory or contract decisions, rely on lender-provided disclosures. See accuracy notes and citations for recommended numeric and QA standards."
