    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates the concrete volume and mass for poured or formed walls using simple dimensional inputs: length (ft), height (ft) and thickness (in). It returns volume in cubic feet, cubic yards, and cubic meters, plus bag-count estimates and approximate weight.",
      "Results use commonly accepted material densities and practical bag yields. They are intended for planning and ordering — allow extra for waste, over-excavation, formwork tolerances, and field adjustments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Volume is computed from the rectangular prism formula: length × height × thickness, with thickness converted from inches to feet. Cubic feet are converted to cubic yards (1 yd³ = 27 ft³) and cubic meters (1 ft³ = 0.0283168466 m³).",
      "Weight uses a typical concrete density of 150 lb/ft³ (≈2400 kg/m³). Bag estimates use common bag yields: ≈0.45 ft³ per 60 lb bag and ≈0.6 ft³ per 80 lb bag. Manufacturer specifications may vary; always confirm with the product datasheet."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Convert thickness to feet: thickness_in / 12",
      "Step 2 — Compute cubic feet: length_ft × height_ft × (thickness_in / 12)",
      "Step 3 — Convert to cubic yards: cubic_feet / 27",
      "Step 4 — Convert to cubic meters: cubic_feet × 0.0283168466",
      "Step 5 — Estimate bags: cubic_feet ÷ bag_yield (0.45 ft³ for 60 lb, 0.6 ft³ for 80 lb)",
      "Step 6 — Estimate mass: cubic_feet × 150 lb/ft³ (convert to kg with 0.45359237)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: 10 ft length × 8 ft height × 8 in thickness → cubic feet = 10 × 8 × (8/12) = 53.333 ft³ → ≈1.976 yd³.",
      "Bag estimate for same wall: 53.333 ft³ ÷ 0.45 ≈ 119 of 60 lb bags (round up and add contingency)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should I order exactly the calculator result?",
        "answer": "No. Always add contingency for waste and field conditions. For simple pours add at least 5–10% extra; for complex forms, deep footings, or where rework is likely, consider 10–15% or consult your supplier."
      },
      {
        "question": "What units do I enter?",
        "answer": "Enter length and height in feet (decimal) and thickness in inches. This keeps inputs simple for common U.S. construction practice. For metric workflows, convert inputs to meters and use a dedicated metric calculator or convert the final results using the cited unit conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are bag estimates and weight?",
        "answer": "Bag yields and densities vary by mix design and moisture. The calculator uses typical values (0.45 ft³ per 60 lb bag, 0.6 ft³ per 80 lb bag, 150 lb/ft³). For procurement, confirm yields and density with the bag or ready-mix supplier."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I measure the wall dimensions in the field?",
        "answer": "Measure multiple points along the wall and use the average for length and height. For variable thickness, break the wall into segments and calculate each segment separately, then sum volumes. Use calibrated tape measures or laser distance meters and follow manufacturer calibration guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety considerations I should know?",
        "answer": "This tool provides quantity estimates only. Structural design, reinforcement, curing, and formwork must comply with local building codes and standards (for example, relevant American Concrete Institute guidance and state/local building codes). Engage a licensed engineer for structural design and code compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the calculator use 150 lb/ft³ for density?",
        "answer": "150 lb/ft³ (≈2400 kg/m³) is a widely used nominal density for normal-weight concrete. Specialty mixes (lightweight or heavyweight) use different densities; check mix design documents or supplier data for precise mass estimates."
