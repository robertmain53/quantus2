    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates angle measures from radians to degrees using the exact mathematical identity applied in mathematics, engineering, and instrumentation. The result is suitable for specification, reporting, and basic instrument readouts when standard rounding is acceptable.",
      "Radians are the SI-consistent dimensionless measure of angle used in calculus and many engineering formulas. Degrees are a legacy angular unit commonly used in surveying, navigation, and user interfaces. Converting between them is lossless in exact arithmetic; displayed precision depends on formatting and instrument limits.",
      "Values returned here use the precise relationship defined by the circle constant: one radian equals 180 divided by pi degrees. For high-precision needs, consult metrology references and confirm instrument calibration limits before using converted values for certification or safety-critical control."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the exact mathematical relationship: degrees = radians × (180 / π). This identity follows from defining a full circle as 2π radians = 360 degrees.",
      "For numeric implementation use a high-precision value of π provided by the runtime or language library (for example IEEE double precision). When displaying results, round only for presentation; retain full-precision values for downstream calculations to avoid cumulative rounding error.",
      "When converting measurements from instruments, factor in the device resolution, calibration uncertainty, and any mechanical/backlash error; conversion itself does not remove measurement uncertainty."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the input in radians.",
      "Step 2: Multiply by (180 / π).",
      "Formula: degrees = radians * (180 / 3.141592653589793...)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 radian → 57.29577951308232 degrees (exactly 180/π).",
      "Example 2: 0.5 radian → 28.64788975654116 degrees.",
      "Example 3: -π/2 radians → -90 degrees (useful for orientation and control systems)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly is a radian and why use it?",
        "answer": "A radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length equals the circle's radius. Radians are dimensionless and preferred in calculus and most physics because they make trigonometric derivatives and integrals direct and unit-consistent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is the conversion factor 180 divided by pi?",
        "answer": "A full circle is 360 degrees and equals 2π radians. Solving for degrees per radian gives (360 degrees) / (2π radians) = 180/π degrees per radian."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Display precision depends on context. For user interfaces 2–6 decimal places are common; for engineering calculations keep full machine precision and round only at the final display stage. Always consider instrument or measurement uncertainty when choosing display precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about negative angles or values larger than 2π?",
        "answer": "No. The conversion formula applies to any real-number angle. If you need a principal angle in [0, 360) degrees or [0, 2π) radians, apply modulo 360 (degrees) or modulo 2π (radians) after conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can converting introduce errors I should watch for?",
        "answer": "Converting using the exact formula does not introduce analytic error, but numeric rounding and the finite precision of computing environments can. For chains of computations, keep full precision and only round for display. For measurements, conversion does not change the measurement's uncertainty—document and propagate uncertainty separately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I look for authoritative guidance on units and metrology?",
        "answer": "National metrology offices and university references provide standards and guidance on units, notation, and calibration. For official SI guidance and calibration services consult the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and international standards bodies."
