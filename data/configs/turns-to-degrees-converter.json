      "Convert angles from radians to degrees and back using the exact mathematical relationship used in scientific and engineering practice. This tool is suitable for quick conversions, scripting, and verification when working with trigonometry, control systems, surveying, or data analysis.",
      "The converter uses the mathematical constant π so results follow the standard relationship between the two units. Results are suitable as a reference; when applying converted values to measurement systems, follow your instrument's resolution and calibration tolerances.",
      "This page includes practical notes on rounding, handling negative or large angles, and references to authoritative sources for unit definitions and best practices."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Radians measure an angle as the ratio of arc length to radius. Degrees split a circle into 360 parts. The exact conversion follows from the definition of π: a full circle is 2π radians = 360 degrees.",
      "We use the exact symbolic relationship degrees = radians × (180 / π). For reverse conversion, radians = degrees × (π / 180). For numerical results the calculator evaluates π to machine precision consistent with IEEE 754 double precision.",
      "When presenting results for instruments or regulatory contexts, round to the significant digits matching your measurement device or the requirement in standards (for example, surveying or instrumentation specs). For angle normalization, optionally map results into a canonical range such as [0°, 360°) or (−180°, 180]."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between radians and degrees?",
        "answer": "One full revolution equals 2π radians or 360 degrees, so 1 radian = 180 / π degrees and 1 degree = π / 180 radians."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use radians instead of degrees in science and engineering?",
        "answer": "Radians are a natural unit for calculus and many mathematical formulas because they represent a pure ratio (arc length over radius). Most analytic expressions for derivatives, integrals, and series assume angle measures in radians."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I keep when converting for instruments?",
        "answer": "Keep at least as many significant digits as your instrument or application requires. For example, if a device reports angles to 0.1°, carry conversions to 1–2 additional digits (e.g., 0.01°) during computation and round only for display to avoid accumulation of rounding error. Follow calibration and uncertainty guidance from your instrument manufacturer or standards such as NIST publications."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle negative angles or wrap-around (values beyond 360°)?",
        "answer": "Convert the angle normally, then apply a normalization if needed. Common ranges are 0° ≤ angle < 360° and −180° < angle ≤ 180°. Use modular arithmetic to wrap values into the desired interval as shown in the methodology steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are radians dimensionless? Can I treat them like regular numbers?",
        "answer": "Radians are a ratio of two lengths (arc length/radius) and are treated as dimensionless in dimensional analysis. However, semantically they represent angular measure—keep units attached in documentation and calculations to avoid confusion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter comply with recognized unit standards?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion is the exact mathematical relationship consistent with international unit guidance. For formal standards and usage guidance, consult resources from national metrology institutes and standardization bodies."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding or precision issues should I watch for in software?",
        "answer": "Floating-point arithmetic is subject to rounding. Use double precision for typical conversions to minimize error. For high-precision needs use libraries that support extended precision or rational arithmetic, and avoid premature rounding until final presentation."
