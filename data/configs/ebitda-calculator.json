1. This is a simple_calc because EBITDA is computed from several numeric inputs (net income, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, adjustments, etc.) where users supply multiple fields and the tool returns one or more derived financial metrics (EBITDA and EBITDA margin).

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, no extra UI/help/layout fields, and no form for converters since this is not a converter).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
