1. This is a simple_calc because EBIT is computed from multiple financial inputs (revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, non-operating income/expense adjustments, and optional items like depreciation/amortization or extraordinary items) using a single clear formula — not a pure unit conversion or a multi-method workflow.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, form for converters, or any custom UI/layout fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
