1. This is an "advanced_calc" because users commonly compute EBIT in more than one way (for example: from operating income directly, from revenue − COGS − operating expenses, or by adjusting net income with interest and tax add‑backs). Supporting multiple methods and conditional inputs gives the most accurate, user-friendly experience.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings only (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, UI/layout/help fields, nor form for a converter, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
