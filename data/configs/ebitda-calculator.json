1. This is a simple_calc because the EBITDA calculation requires multiple related user inputs (revenues, operating expenses, depreciation, amortization, interest, taxes, and optional adjustments) and produces one primary numeric result (EBITDA) plus secondary outputs (EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA), which matches the "formula with multiple inputs" use case.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, open_graph, form for converters, or other unlisted keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
