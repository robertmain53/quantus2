    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates EBITDA — Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization — by summing net income with interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization inputs. It is intended for business owners, analysts, and advisors who need a quick, auditable calculation from line-item financial data.",
      "EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure commonly used to compare operating performance, support valuations, and analyze cash-generation before financing and tax effects. This tool produces a standard EBITDA and, when revenue is provided, an EBITDA margin to aid comparability.",
      "Use this as an analytical aid, not as a substitute for audited financial statements or professional accounting advice. For regulatory perspectives on non-GAAP measures see guidance from standard-setters and regulators cited below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Formula used: EBITDA = Net income + Interest expense + Tax expense + Depreciation + Amortization. When revenue is provided, EBITDA margin (%) = EBITDA / Revenue × 100.",
      "Inputs should be taken from the same reporting period (e.g., annual or trailing-12-month). Ensure consistency in accounting treatments (cash vs. accrual, capitalization of costs) when comparing across periods or companies.",
      "This calculator implements the standard summation approach and does not automatically adjust for one-time items, stock-based compensation, or other common adjustments. If you want an adjusted EBITDA, add or subtract those specific items to the relevant inputs before using this tool.",
      "Limitations: EBITDA removes financing and tax effects but does not represent free cash flow. Depreciation and amortization reflect management's capitalization and useful-life choices and may vary by accounting policy."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly does EBITDA measure?",
        "answer": "EBITDA approximates operating profitability by excluding financing costs, tax charge, and non-cash depreciation and amortization. It is useful for comparing core operating performance across firms with different capital structures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is EBITDA a GAAP metric?",
        "answer": "No. EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric. Regulators and standard-setters advise that non-GAAP measures be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure and be presented transparently."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I treat unusual or one-time items?",
        "answer": "If you want 'adjusted EBITDA', explicitly add back or subtract one-time items (e.g., restructuring costs, litigation settlements) before or after this calculation and document the adjustments for auditability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might EBITDA differ from operating income (EBIT)?",
        "answer": "EBIT (Operating income) excludes interest and taxes but includes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA adds back depreciation and amortization to EBIT, so EBITDA will be higher when depreciation/amortization are positive."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I interpret EBITDA margin?",
        "answer": "EBITDA margin (EBITDA / Revenue) expresses operating profitability as a share of revenue. Use it to compare companies in the same industry and with similar accounting policies; it is less informative across industries with differing capital intensity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my revenue is zero or negative?",
        "answer": "EBITDA margin is undefined or misleading if revenue is zero or negative. In such cases, rely on absolute EBITDA and qualitative analysis of cash flows and business viability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use EBITDA for valuation?",
        "answer": "EBITDA is commonly used in valuation multiples (e.g., EV/EBITDA). Valuation professionals typically adjust EBITDA for recurring, sustainable, and normalized items before applying multiples. Consult valuation standards and an accredited appraiser for formal valuations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I look for authoritative guidance on accounting treatments?",
        "answer": "Refer to recognized standard-setters and regulatory guidance for authoritative positions on accounting presentation and non-GAAP disclosure. Professional accountants and auditors provide entity-specific guidance."
