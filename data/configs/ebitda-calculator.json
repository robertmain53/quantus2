    "introduction": [
      "This EBITDA calculator computes Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization by adding standard non-operating and non-cash items back to net income. Use it to get a quick, consistent operating-profit proxy for comparing performance across periods or peers.",
      "EBITDA is a widely used metric for operational comparability but is not a GAAP substitute for cash flow or net income. Inputs must cover the same reporting period and be expressed in the same currency. Where items are non-recurring or unusual, consider adjusting inputs and document those adjustments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We calculate EBITDA as: Net income + Interest expense + Tax expense + Depreciation + Amortization. This aligns with common financial practice used in valuation and credit analysis.",
      "EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by Revenue (expressed as a percentage). Use margin to compare operating profitability relative to sales.",
      "When preparing inputs, follow official reporting in financial statements. For depreciation and amortization, use amounts reported on the income statement or notes. For interest and tax, use the expense amounts for the same period.",
      "Adjustments: exclude one-off gains or losses that distort recurring operating performance (for example, asset sales, restructuring charges) only after documenting and, when useful, presenting both reported and adjusted EBITDA.",
      "Limitations: EBITDA excludes capital expenditure needs, working capital movements, and financing structure. For cash-flow sensitive uses (debt service ability, free cash flow), combine EBITDA with cash conversion and capex analysis."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly do I add back to compute EBITDA?",
        "answer": "Add interest expense, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization to net income for the same reporting period. Ensure each input comes from the period's income statement or footnotes and is in the same currency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I start from operating income (EBIT) instead of net income?",
        "answer": "Yes. If you have EBIT (operating income), EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation + amortization. This calculator starts from net income but produces the same result if inputs are entered consistently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I adjust EBITDA for one-time items?",
        "answer": "Adjusting for non-recurring items can improve comparability for valuation or credit analysis, but always show both reported EBITDA and adjusted figures, and document your rationale and adjustment amounts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is EBITDA a measure of cash flow?",
        "answer": "No. EBITDA approximates operating profitability before certain non-cash and financing items but does not account for capital expenditures, changes in working capital, or debt service. Use it alongside cash flow metrics."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if revenue is zero or negative when computing EBITDA margin?",
        "answer": "If revenue is zero, EBITDA margin is undefined. If revenue is negative, margins are not meaningful for standard comparability. Inspect the financials and consider alternative denominators or presenting EBITDA without a margin."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the results and how should I round?",
        "answer": "Round outputs to a level appropriate for your analysis (typically nearest thousand for large companies or nearest unit for small businesses). Ensure inputs are rounded consistently to avoid introducing material rounding error."
