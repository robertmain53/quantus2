    "introduction": [
      "This EBITDA calculator computes EBITDA using standard reconciliations from operating items and from net income. EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) is a non-GAAP performance metric commonly used to compare operating profitability across companies and periods.",
      "Use the operating-items approach when you have segmented operating expense detail; use the reconciliation-from-net-income approach to cross-check results against the income statement when only bottom-line figures are available. The tool also returns EBITDA margin and EBITDA per employee to aid comparability."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary calculation (operating-items): EBIT = Total revenue − COGS − Operating expenses (excluding D&A). EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization. This produces an operating-based EBITDA that isolates recurring operating performance.",
      "Reconciliation (from net income): EBITDA = Net income + Interest expense + Tax expense + Depreciation + Amortization. This reconciliation follows common practice used in financial reporting to convert GAAP net income to an operating measure.",
      "Margin and per-employee metrics: EBITDA margin = (EBITDA / Total revenue) × 100. EBITDA per employee = EBITDA ÷ number of employees. Inputs with zero revenue or zero employees are safeguarded to avoid divide-by-zero; review edge-case outputs manually.",
      "Limitations and adjustments: EBITDA excludes interest, taxes, and non-cash charges but does not equal cash flow. For comparability adjust for one-time items (restructuring, impairment, M&A costs) and adopt consistent definitions across periods. Where regulatory or GAAP reconciliation is required, prefer the reconciliation presented in audited financial statements."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is EBITDA a GAAP measure?",
        "answer": "No. EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric used for analysis and comparability. Financial statement preparers may provide reconciliations to GAAP measures. For formal reporting and regulatory guidance consult your jurisdictional accounting standards and filings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which inputs should I use if my accounting groups depreciation inside COGS?",
        "answer": "If depreciation or amortization is included in COGS or operating expenses, extract and enter the D&A amounts separately and enter the remaining COGS/operating-expense portions accordingly so the calculator adds back depreciation and amortization explicitly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do the operating-items EBITDA and the net-income reconciliation EBITDA differ?",
        "answer": "Differences arise from classification, rounding, timing, and one-time items. Ensure interest and taxes are entered on the same basis as net income (period and currency). Reconcile line-by-line with the income statement to identify classification mismatches."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results and how should I validate them?",
        "answer": "This calculator performs arithmetic reconciliations. Validate outputs against audited financial statements, cash flow statements, and management disclosures. For critical decisions, have outputs reviewed by a qualified accountant or financial advisor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use EBITDA to compare companies across industries?",
        "answer": "EBITDA can help compare operating performance but it omits capital intensity, tax regimes, and financing differences. Use industry-adjusted metrics and make explicit adjustments for non-recurring items when comparing across industries."
