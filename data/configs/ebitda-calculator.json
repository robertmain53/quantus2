1. This is a simple_calc because EBITDA is computed from multiple input fields (e.g., net income, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and optional adjustments) and the tool must evaluate a formula to produce one primary numeric output (EBITDA) plus optional derived outputs (EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA).

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata, no schema_org, no custom UI properties, no converters' form omissions, etc.). The only allowed fields for simple_calc will be used.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
