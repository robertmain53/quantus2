    "introduction": [
      "This EBITDA calculator computes Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) from standard financial statement line items. Enter values in your functional reporting currency. The calculator also produces EBITDA margin when revenue is provided.",
      "EBITDA is a commonly used non-GAAP measure for comparing operating performance across companies and periods. It is a simple arithmetic aggregation: add interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization back to net income to arrive at EBITDA. Use caution: EBITDA is not a substitute for cash flow or GAAP/IFRS operating income.",
      "This tool is intended for preliminary analysis, benchmarking, and valuation work. For audited reporting, tax filings, or regulatory disclosures follow governing standards and professional accounting guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formula used by this calculator: EBITDA = Net income + Interest expense + Income tax expense + Depreciation + Amortization. This follows the standard reconciliation approach published in academic and regulatory guidance for non-GAAP measures.",
      "If you prefer an alternative starting point, EBITDA can also be computed as Operating income (or EBIT) + Depreciation + Amortization. Either approach is algebraically consistent when reconciled to audited statements.",
      "EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by total revenue and expressed as a percentage. If revenue is zero or not provided, margin is undefined; do not rely on the margin value in that case.",
      "Adjustments and normalization: this calculator provides a baseline EBITDA. Analysts frequently adjust for one-time items (restructuring, M&A costs), non-cash stock-based compensation, and operational anomalies to produce an adjusted EBITDA used in valuation. Any adjustments should be documented and consistent across comparable companies.",
      "Regulatory note: EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric. In the United States the SEC requires clear reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and disclosure of why management believes they are useful. Apply local regulatory guidance when using EBITDA in investor materials or filings."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly does EBITDA represent?",
        "answer": "EBITDA represents earnings before the effects of financing (interest), taxation, and non-cash depreciation and amortization. It is intended to show operating performance independent of capital structure and non-cash accounting allocations, but it does not equal cash flow."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is EBITDA a GAAP or IFRS metric?",
        "answer": "No. EBITDA is a non-GAAP / non-IFRS performance measure. While derived from GAAP/IFRS line items, it is a management metric and requires reconciliation to the nearest GAAP/IFRS measure when disclosed publicly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which inputs should I use if I only have operating income?",
        "answer": "If you have Operating income (EBIT), compute EBITDA as Operating income + Depreciation + Amortization. This calculator accepts net income plus add-backs by default; you can enter operating income into net income and set other fields accordingly, or use the algebraic equivalence when reconciling figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I treat negative values or losses?",
        "answer": "Enter negative values for net loss or for interest income (as negative interest expense). The arithmetic aggregation remains valid. For margin measures, be aware that negative or very small revenue can produce misleading percentages."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use EBITDA for valuation (EV/EBITDA)?",
        "answer": "Yes, EBITDA is commonly used in valuation multiples like Enterprise Value / EBITDA. Use consistently defined, normalized EBITDA across comparables and confirm whether adjustments (one-time items, owner compensation) should be made for comparability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common limitations of EBITDA?",
        "answer": "EBITDA ignores capital expenditures, working capital needs, lease obligations, interest costs, and tax realities. It can overstate distributable cash for capital-intensive businesses. Always complement EBITDA with cash flow and balance sheet analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are results from this calculator?",
        "answer": "This calculator performs direct arithmetic on the inputs you provide. Precision and validity depend on the accuracy and consistency of your inputs. For audited reporting, use source financial statements and follow accounting standards for reconciliations."
