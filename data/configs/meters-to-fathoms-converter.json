    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length given in meters to fathoms using the fixed international definition: 1 fathom is equal to 6 feet, which equals exactly 1.8288 meters. Use this converter for quick, deterministic conversions where the relationship between units is constant.",
      "Results are mathematical conversions only. They do not account for measurement instrument uncertainty, environmental effects, or domain-specific rounding rules. For regulated or safety-critical applications, verify values against instrument calibration records and applicable standards before use.",
      "The converter provides guidance on calculation method, practical examples, and references to authoritative sources on units and metrology for users who need traceability or to confirm precision requirements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the internationally accepted relationship: 1 fathom = 1.8288 meters. This relationship derives from the definition of a foot (0.3048 meters) and the historical definition of a fathom as 6 feet.",
      "We present two equivalent calculation forms so implementers or auditors can check results: divide meters by 1.8288, or multiply meters by the reciprocal coefficient 0.5468066495726496. Both produce the same numeric result within rounding limits.",
      "For applications requiring documented accuracy or traceability, follow measurement and calibration guidance from national metrology institutes and international standards (for example, NIST publications and ISO metrology standards). Maintain calibration certificates for measuring instruments and record uncertainty budgets where required."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: fathoms = meters / 1.8288",
      "Equivalent formula using reciprocal: fathoms = meters * 0.5468066495726496",
      "Practical steps: (1) Take the input in meters. (2) Apply either formula above. (3) Round the result according to required significant figures or regulatory rounding rules."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Convert 10 meters to fathoms. Calculation: 10 / 1.8288 = 5.4680664957 → rounded to 4 decimal places = 5.4681 fathoms.",
      "Example 2: Convert 98.1 meters to fathoms. Calculation: 98.1 / 1.8288 = 53.6417323231 → rounded to 4 decimal places = 53.6417 fathoms."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a fathom in modern terms?",
        "answer": "A fathom is defined as 6 feet, which equals exactly 1.8288 meters under the international definition of the foot. It is commonly used in maritime contexts to measure water depth."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Decimal places depend on your application. For general use 3–4 decimal places are often sufficient. For regulatory, engineering, or scientific work, follow the required significant figures and uncertainty analysis specified by your authority or standard operating procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The numerical relationship 1 fathom = 1.8288 meters is exact by definition. However, practical results may be affected by rounding and by measurement uncertainties when converting measured lengths rather than defined values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate instruments for conversions?",
        "answer": "Conversion arithmetic does not require calibration, but if you are converting measured values (for example, lengths measured with a tape or sonar), you must ensure instruments are calibrated and documented per relevant metrology standards to claim traceability and stated uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative guidance on units and measurement practice?",
        "answer": "Refer to national metrology bodies and international standards for guidance. Key resources include national metrology publications, ISO standards on quantities and units, and guides on SI usage and measurement uncertainty."
