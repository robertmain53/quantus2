1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion depends on a variable exchange rate (not a fixed unit ratio) and the calculation requires at least two inputs (amount and exchange rate) to produce a single primary output.

2. I will use component_type: 'simple_calc' with logic.type: 'formula'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta fields, no schema_org beyond allowed schema.additionalTypes, and no form for converters since this is a simple_calc).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
