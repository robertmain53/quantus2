    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a volume value given in liters to US customary cups using the fixed relationship 1 US cup = 236.5882365 milliliters. It is intended for everyday cooking, lab-approximation, and quick engineering checks where the US cup is the desired target unit.",
      "If you need a different cup definition (metric cup = 250 mL or imperial cup ≈ 284.130625 mL) choose a converter configured for that cup variant or apply the milliliter-based steps from the methodology section. For measurements requiring traceable accuracy, follow calibration and uncertainty guidance in the methodology and citations."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base quantities: 1 liter = 1000 milliliters. The converter applies the exact milliliter ratio for the chosen cup type. For the US customary cup the exact value used is 236.5882365 mL.",
      "To convert, the converter multiplies liters by the ratio (1000 mL per liter) divided by the cup volume in milliliters. This is a fixed mathematical conversion independent of temperature or pressure because it is a change of units, not a physical property measurement.",
      "Accuracy and traceability: unit conversions are exact given the constants used, but real-world measurement uncertainty comes from the instrument used to measure volume (graduated cylinder, pipette, kitchen measuring cup). For laboratory-grade work use calibrated equipment and follow ISO/IEC 17025 recommendations for measurement uncertainty and traceability."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert liters to milliliters: milliliters = liters × 1000",
      "Step 2: Divide by the cup volume (US cup = 236.5882365 mL): cups (US) = milliliters ÷ 236.5882365",
      "Combined formula: cups (US) = liters × (1000 ÷ 236.5882365) ≈ liters × 4.226752837730",
      "Rounding: results are displayed with a reasonable default precision; for engineering or regulatory work round according to your uncertainty budget and significant-figure rules per NIST/ISO guidance."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.5 L → 0.5 × (1000 ÷ 236.5882365) ≈ 2.113376 US cups",
      "1 L → 1 × (1000 ÷ 236.5882365) ≈ 4.226753 US cups",
      "3.785411784 L (1 US gallon) → 3.785411784 × (1000 ÷ 236.5882365) = 16 US cups exactly by definition of the gallon/cup relationship"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which cup definition does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the US customary cup (1 US cup = 236.5882365 mL). If you need a metric cup (250 mL) or imperial cup (~284.130625 mL), use a converter set to that cup variant or convert via milliliters using the formula in the methodology section."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between liters and cups is exact given the constants. Practical precision depends on how the input volume was measured. For traceable results in laboratories, follow ISO/IEC 17025 for calibration and declare measurement uncertainty as recommended by NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert cups back to liters?",
        "answer": "Invert the formula: liters = cups (US) × 236.5882365 ÷ 1000, or liters = cups × 0.2365882365. Use the same cup definition consistently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can temperature or pressure change the conversion?",
        "answer": "Unit conversion itself is independent of temperature and pressure because it is a change of units. However, the measured volume of some materials (notably gases or temperature-sensitive liquids) can vary with temperature; where that matters, control or correct for temperature per applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are recommended practices for accurate volume measurement?",
        "answer": "Use appropriately sized calibrated volumetric equipment, allow liquids to stabilize, read at the bottom of the meniscus for aqueous solutions, and account for measurement uncertainty. For regulated or high-accuracy work, keep calibration records and follow ISO/IEC 17025 and related NIST guidance."
