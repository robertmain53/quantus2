    "introduction": [
      "Use this estimator to convert a Bitcoin amount into an estimated US Dollar value. You can enter a live market exchange rate or an override for a specific quote, then include platform fees, network fees, and expected slippage to see net proceeds.",
      "This tool is intended for estimation and planning. Transaction execution prices can differ from the mid-market rate shown here due to order book depth, exchange spreads, and timing. For official valuations (tax reporting, accounting), retain exchange transaction records and consult tax guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator multiplies the BTC amount by the exchange rate to compute gross USD, then subtracts platform fees (percentage of trade) and fixed network fees in USD. Slippage is estimated as a percentage of the gross USD and shown separately so users can judge market-impact risk.",
      "Recommended best practice: use the real-time quote from the executing venue for exchange_rate when preparing to transact, and add both platform and network fees reported by that venue. For tax and compliance, reconcile this estimator with timestamped transaction receipts from your wallet or exchange."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Gross USD = Amount (BTC) × Exchange rate (USD/BTC).",
      "Total fees (USD) = Gross USD × (Platform fee %) / 100 + Network fee (USD).",
      "Estimated slippage (USD) = Gross USD × (Slippage %) / 100.",
      "Net USD = Gross USD − Total fees (does not automatically subtract slippage; slippage is shown separately so you can see market-impact risk)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where should I get the exchange rate used here?",
        "answer": "For transaction planning, use the live quote from the exchange or venue where you will trade. Aggregated mid-market rates are suitable for estimates; for executed trades, use the actual fill price from your trade receipt to reconcile proceeds."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include miner/network fees and slippage?",
        "answer": "Yes. Enter any fixed network or miner fee in USD. Slippage is estimated as a percentage of the gross USD value and shown separately so you can see potential market-impact loss; include slippage when planning large orders."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the output appropriate for tax or accounting?",
        "answer": "This tool provides an estimate. For tax and accounting, use transaction-level records and follow local tax authority guidance. In the United States, the IRS treats virtual currency as property; consult IRS guidance and a tax professional for definitive treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I refresh the exchange rate?",
        "answer": "Exchange rates for cryptocurrencies can change rapidly. Refresh rates immediately before trading. For real-time programmatic use, consider feeds that update every few seconds and include order-book depth to estimate slippage more accurately."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the limitations of this estimator?",
        "answer": "This estimator does not execute trades and does not access your exchange account. It does not include deposit/withdrawal fees, fiat conversion fees applied by banking rails, or exchange-specific spreads unless you manually enter them. Use it as an informed estimate, not a guaranteed settlement amount."
