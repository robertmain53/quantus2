    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms energy measured in joules (J) into British Thermal Units (BTU), using the internationally referenced BTU definition. It is intended for engineers, lab technicians, students, and anyone needing an accurate, traceable conversion between these two energy units.",
      "Where precision matters, this tool follows the NIST-recommended International Table definition for the BTU (see citations). Guidance on rounding, measurement uncertainty, and calibration context is provided so you can interpret results reliably for reporting, lab work, or regulatory submissions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the fixed relationship between the joule and the BTU as defined by authoritative metrology bodies. This converter uses the International Table BTU value expressed in joules, enabling reproducible, SI-consistent conversions.",
      "When converting, we recommend keeping track of significant figures from your measured value and applying rounding only after the conversion to avoid introducing avoidable rounding error. For reported results in technical documents, follow the significant-figure rules in NIST or your laboratory’s SOPs.",
      "For measurements that depend on instrument calibration or thermal-property assumptions, consult calibration certificates and applicable guidance from national laboratories (for example, NIST) and energy regulators (for example, EIA or DOE) to assess combined measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary conversion formula (International Table BTU): BTU = joules ÷ 1055.05585262",
      "Step 1: Take the energy value in joules. Step 2: Divide by 1055.05585262 to get BTU. Step 3: Round to the appropriate number of significant figures based on measurement precision or reporting requirements.",
      "Example representation: 1 BTU = 1055.05585262 J (International Table definition, NIST-referenced)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000 J = 1,000 ÷ 1055.05585262 = 0.947817 BTU (rounded to 6 decimal places).",
      "1,055.05585262 J = 1.000000 BTU (exact by definition used here).",
      "1,000,000 J = 947.817120 BTU (rounded to 6 decimal places)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor does this tool use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the International Table BTU definition: 1 BTU = 1055.05585262 J, consistent with NIST-referenced unit tables. That value produces reproducible conversions for engineering and reporting purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there different BTU definitions and does it matter?",
        "answer": "Yes. Historical and regional BTU definitions exist (for example, thermochemical vs. International Table variants). Differences are small but can matter in high-precision contexts. This tool uses the International Table definition; if you require a different BTU convention, consult metrology references and adjust calculations accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the precision of your original measurement or instrument. Do not add precision by converting and then reporting more digits. For regulatory or published work, follow the guidance in NIST SP publications or your organization's measurement policies."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle measurement uncertainty and calibration limits?",
        "answer": "Report the measurement result with an uncertainty statement derived from instrument calibration data, repeatability, and relevant environmental factors. Use calibration certificates and the uncertainty-propagation methods recommended by NIST or ISO to produce a combined uncertainty for converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from BTU to joules using the same factor?",
        "answer": "Yes. To convert BTU to joules, multiply BTU by 1055.05585262 J/BTU. Conversions are reversible using the same precise factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it acceptable to use Joules for regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "Many regulatory frameworks and scientific reports prefer SI units (joules or multiples such as kilojoules). When a non-SI unit like BTU is required or customary, include the SI equivalent and document the conversion factor and uncertainty per reporting guidelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references for unit definitions?",
        "answer": "Authoritative references include national metrology institutes and international bodies. See the citations below for NIST unit tables, the SI Brochure at BIPM, and energy conversion guidance from U.S. energy authorities."
