      "This calculator estimates the additional retirement contributions you may be allowed to make under common U.S. catch-up provisions. It supports the standard age 50+ catch-up, a simplified 457(b) special catch-up estimate, and the SIMPLE IRA catch-up. Because contribution limits are set by law and vary year to year, fields are provided so you can enter the latest IRS limits used by your plan.",
      "The tool is a planning aid and does not replace plan documents, your plan administrator, or formal tax advice. Use the override fields to reflect the current official limits published by the IRS for the tax year you are planning."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator uses three purpose-built methods to reflect the different catch-up rules: standard age-50+ catch-up (applies to many defined contribution plans), a simplified 457(b) special catch-up window (an estimate model), and SIMPLE IRA catch-up.",
      "Inputs include participant age, plan type, annual elective deferral limit, catch-up limit(s), and contributions already made. The logic computes eligibility flags and applies user-provided limits to compute available incremental contribution amounts and projected totals."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Standard age-50+ catch-up: If age is 50 or older, available catch-up equals the catch-up limit entered. Projected total equals current contribution plus the catch-up limit.",
      "457(b) special estimate: Simplified model multiplies the annual elective deferral limit by the number of years in the special window (user-set) to produce an estimated special catch-up pool; projected total adds that estimate to current contributions.",
      "SIMPLE IRA: If the plan type is SIMPLE and age is 50 or older, available catch-up equals the SIMPLE catch-up limit the user enters; projected total adds that amount to current contributions."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Are the numeric defaults guaranteed to match IRS limits?",
        "answer": "No. Limits are set by the IRS and can change annually. Default numeric values are for convenience only. Always confirm the current limits from the IRS or your plan sponsor and enter them into the appropriate fields."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool replace my plan administrator or tax advisor?",
        "answer": "No. This tool is a planning estimator. For binding determinations about allowable contributions, consult your plan documents, plan administrator, or a qualified tax advisor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the 457(b) special catch-up calculation exact?",
        "answer": "No. The 457(b) special catch-up provision has rules that depend on unused deferral history and plan specifics. This method provides an estimate; for precise calculations consult your plan administrator."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if my plan enforces lower limits than IRS maximums?",
        "answer": "Enter the plan-specific annual limit in the 'Plan's current annual elective deferral limit' field. This calculator uses the values supplied by you to produce estimates."
