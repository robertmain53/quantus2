    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts energy values from joules (J) to kilojoules (kJ) using the SI prefix relationship. It is intended for quick, exact numeric conversion when units are known; no assumptions are made about measurement uncertainty or instrumentation.",
      "The conversion reflects the SI prefix rule that kilo means 1,000. Use this converter for lab notes, engineering estimates, technical documentation, or when preparing values for regulatory or reporting workflows where SI-consistent units are required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the international SI prefix definition: 1 kilojoule equals 1,000 joules. The converter performs a straightforward scale change without applying rounding beyond the display precision requested by the UI.",
      "For traceability and measurement-grade reporting, retain the original measurement uncertainty and calibration certificates from your instrument. This converter only transforms the numeric value between units; it does not change measurement uncertainty, significant-figure rules, or instrument calibration status."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Exact relationship: 1 kJ = 1,000 J.",
      "To convert joules to kilojoules: kJ = J / 1000.",
      "To convert kilojoules to joules: J = kJ × 1000. The arithmetic is exact; any displayed rounding is a formatting choice, not a change in underlying precision."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 J → 0.5 kJ",
      "1,234 J → 1.234 kJ",
      "12,345 J → 12.345 kJ"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion between joules and kilojoules is exact because kilo is defined as 1,000 in the International System of Units (SI). Any difference you see in displayed values is due to rounding or formatting, not the conversion itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to adjust values for instrument calibration or uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No adjustment to the numeric unit conversion is required for calibration, but you must retain and report measurement uncertainty and calibration details separately. Follow your lab or regulatory protocol for uncertainty propagation and calibration traceability; see national calibration guidance for details."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report after conversion?",
        "answer": "Preserve the significant figures from the original measurement unless your reporting standard instructs otherwise. Rounding rules depend on context—laboratory reporting, regulatory submissions, and engineering calculations may each require different precision; consult your internal SOPs or referenced standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small values safely?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion is a simple scale by 1,000 and is safe across typical numeric ranges. For extreme magnitudes check that your environment supports the required numeric range and consider using scientific notation to avoid overflow or loss of precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references for the SI definition used here?",
        "answer": "Authoritative sources include national metrology institutes and the BIPM SI brochure. See the citations below for direct links to SI guidance and national calibration resources."
