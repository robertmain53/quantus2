    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms energy measurements from Joules to Kilojoules, enabling practical presentation of large energy values.",
      "The Joule is the SI base unit of energy, while the Kilojoule provides a more readable scale for engineering and nutrition applications. This conversion bridges scientific precision and practical clarity.",
      "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 kilojoule equals exactly 1,000 Joules."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 kJ = 1,000 J. To convert joules to kilojoules, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 J = 1 kJ, 50,000 J = 50 kJ, 1,000,000 J = 1,000 kJ.",
      "Physics equations produce results in joules, but engineering documentation typically uses kilojoules for clarity. Converting enables proper communication across disciplines.",
      "Nutrition science uses kilojoules as the standard energy unit in most countries. Converting from joules enables food energy comparison.",
      "This converter provides precise energy conversions for engineering, nutrition, and scientific applications."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Food energy: 2,000,000 J of dietary energy converts to 2,000 kJ, typical daily caloric intake for adults.",
      "Example 2 – Motor efficiency: A motor consuming 150,000 J of input energy uses 150 kJ, essential for power consumption analysis.",
      "Example 3 – Fuel energy: 100 kg of fuel with 46,000,000 J of energy provides 46,000 kJ of heat, useful for heating system design."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Joules to Kilojoules?",
        "answer": "1 kJ = 1,000 J. Divide joules by 1,000 to get kilojoules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use kilojoules instead of joules?",
        "answer": "Kilojoules provide more readable numbers for large energy quantities. 50 kJ is clearer than 50,000 J in most engineering contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do joules convert to food calories?",
        "answer": "1 food Calorie (kcal) ≈ 4.184 kJ. Use kilojoules for scientific nutrition work."
