    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates allowable SEP IRA employer contributions for traditional employer relationships (W-2 employees) and for owner-only/self-employed taxpayers. It implements the common IRS approach where employer contributions are limited to a percentage of compensation and also capped by the IRS annual contribution limit.",
      "For sole proprietors and other self-employed taxpayers the calculation must account for half of self-employment tax and the deduction interaction that reduces the effective contribution percentage. Use the fields to enter your compensation or net self-employment income and, if needed, an estimate of half your self-employment tax."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Employer method: contribution is compensation × chosen rate (typically up to 25% for eligible employees). The calculator applies an IRS annual dollar limit (entered above) and returns the lesser of the percentage calculation and the dollar cap.",
      "Self-employed method (sole proprietors): the contribution interacts with the allowable deduction. The conventional approach here uses the employer fraction of 25% but converts it to an effective rate for self-employed taxpayers by solving for the contribution when the deduction reduces the base. Mathematically this is rate / (1 + rate) applied to net earnings after subtracting half self-employment tax. For rate=25%, the effective multiplier is 0.25/(1+0.25) = 0.20 (20%).",
      "Security and accuracy: calculators like this must protect user data and follow recognized controls for handling sensitive financial inputs. We recommend implementing controls aligned with NIST SP 800-53 / NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 27001 for information security. Calculation logic should be validated and unit-tested; follow IEEE best practices for numerical robustness and document assumptions."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Employer (employees): contribution = min(compensation × (employer_rate_percent / 100), annual_limit).",
      "Self-employed (sole proprietor): contribution = min((rate / (1 + rate)) × (net_self_employment_income − half_self_employment_tax), annual_limit), where rate = 0.25 for the standard 25% employer fraction (effective multiplier = 0.25 / 1.25 = 0.20).",
      "Estimate half self-employment tax: half_self_employment_tax ≈ net_self_employment_income × 0.0765 (that is half of 15.3% Self‑Employment tax) if you do not have an exact figure from your tax calculations."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 (employee): Compensation = $60,000, Employer rate = 25% → uncapped contribution = $15,000. If the IRS annual limit is $69,000 the contribution stays $15,000.",
      "Example 2 (self-employed): Net profit = $100,000, estimate half SE tax ≈ $7,650 → adjusted income = $92,350. Effective multiplier = 0.25/1.25 = 0.20 → uncapped contribution ≈ $18,470; apply the annual dollar limit if lower."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator include the IRS dollar limit?",
        "answer": "Yes. Enter the current IRS annual contribution limit in the 'IRS annual contribution limit' field. The tool returns the lesser of the percentage-based contribution and that dollar cap. Verify the limit for your tax year from the IRS or your tax advisor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I estimate half of self-employment tax?",
        "answer": "If you do not have the exact figure from tax computations, estimate half of self-employment tax as net_self_employment_income × 0.0765 (half of 15.3%). For precise results use the actual amount from Schedule SE or your tax preparer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the effective rate for self-employed always 20%?",
        "answer": "The 20% effective multiplier shown arises from using the 25% employer fraction and solving for the deduction interaction: 0.25/(1+0.25)=0.20. If a different employer percentage is used, the calculator will apply the corresponding formula."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this a substitute for tax or legal advice?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides estimates only. Always verify calculations against IRS guidance and consult a tax professional for planning, filing, or compliance questions."
