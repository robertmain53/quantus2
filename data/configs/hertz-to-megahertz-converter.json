    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms hertz to megahertz for radio frequency specifications.",
      "Radio frequencies are commonly expressed in MHz for convenience and clarity.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 megahertz equals 1 million hertz."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz. To convert Hz to MHz, divide by 1,000,000.",
      "Radio bands span from kHz to GHz depending on application.",
      "Understanding frequency conversion is essential for radio electronics.",
      "This converter provides precise frequency conversion."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – FM radio: 88,500,000 Hz = 88.5 MHz.",
      "Example 2 – Cellular: 800,000,000 Hz = 800 MHz.",
      "Example 3 – WiFi: 2,400,000,000 Hz = 2,400 MHz."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is megahertz used for?",
        "answer": "Radio frequencies, WiFi, cellular bands, and RF engineering specifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What radio frequencies are common?",
        "answer": "FM: 88-108 MHz. AM: 535-1605 kHz. Cell: 800-2100 MHz. WiFi: 2.4 and 5 GHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I remember the conversion?",
        "answer": "1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz. Divide by million to convert Hz to MHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a gigahertz?",
        "answer": "1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. Used for microwave frequencies and modern WiFi."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use MHz instead of Hz?",
        "answer": "MHz reduces large numbers. 88.5 MHz easier to understand than 88,500,000 Hz."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can radio frequencies be fractional?",
        "answer": "Yes. Modern frequencies use decimals: 88.1 MHz, 101.5 MHz, 2.437 GHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do frequency bands work?",
        "answer": "Regulatory agencies allocate specific frequency ranges for different uses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is 5G in GHz?",
        "answer": "Yes, 5G uses much higher frequencies: 24-72 GHz mmWave bands."
