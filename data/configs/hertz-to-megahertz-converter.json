    "introduction": [
      "Convert frequency values in hertz (Hz) to megahertz (MHz) instantly. This tool uses standard SI prefix relationships so results align with international measurement conventions.",
      "Megahertz is a derived SI unit using the prefix 'mega' (1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz). Use this converter for engineering calculations, test reports, documentation, and quick unit checks.",
      "Guidance below includes how the conversion is computed, recommended precision practices for measurement instruments, and links to authoritative sources for calibration and regulatory frequency planning."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion follows SI prefixes: mega (M) = 10^6. The converter divides the input in hertz by 1,000,000 to produce megahertz.",
      "Values are presented in decimal and can be expressed in scientific notation to preserve significant digits for very large or small measurements. For measurement traceability and calibration guidance, follow NIST recommendations and use equipment calibrated to an accredited standard.",
      "When reporting converted values, consider the resolution and uncertainty of the original measurement instrument. Round or present significant figures consistent with the instrument's uncertainty and the needs of the application (e.g., lab reports, frequency allocation filings)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the frequency value in hertz (Hz).",
      "Step 2: Apply the SI prefix conversion: 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz.",
      "Formula: MHz = Hz ÷ 1,000,000 (equivalently MHz = Hz × 10^-6).",
      "Example computational note: 2,450,000 Hz → 2.45 MHz. Use scientific notation for clarity: 2.45 × 10^0 MHz or 2.45e0 MHz."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 Hz = 0.000001 MHz (1 × 10^-6 MHz)",
      "1500000 Hz = 1.5 MHz",
      "2450000000 Hz = 2450 MHz (2.45 GHz; shows how conversions chain between prefixes)",
      "0.5 Hz = 0.0000005 MHz"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact mathematical relationship between Hz and MHz?",
        "answer": "1 MHz equals 1,000,000 Hz. To convert hertz to megahertz, divide the hertz value by 1,000,000 (MHz = Hz ÷ 1,000,000)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep when converting?",
        "answer": "Keep significant figures consistent with your measurement uncertainty. If your frequency counter reports ±1 Hz at 1,000,000 Hz, convert and present uncertainty in MHz (±1 × 10^-6 MHz) and round results to match that uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this converter for very large frequencies (GHz and above)?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert Hz to MHz first, then apply further SI prefixes as needed (e.g., 1,000 MHz = 1 GHz). For extremely large values, scientific notation helps avoid precision loss."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for instrument calibration or measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No — this tool performs a mathematical unit conversion only. For calibrated measurements and uncertainty budgets, refer to accredited lab procedures and NIST guidance on calibration and traceability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are MHz and Hz SI units?",
        "answer": "Hertz (Hz) is the SI unit for frequency. Megahertz (MHz) is a derived unit using the SI prefix 'mega' (10^6). Both follow SI conventions for unit prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety concerns when reporting frequencies?",
        "answer": "Reporting frequency values is not in itself a safety issue, but regulatory context matters for spectrum use. For frequency allocations, emissions limits, and licensing requirements consult your national telecommunications authority and international bodies."
