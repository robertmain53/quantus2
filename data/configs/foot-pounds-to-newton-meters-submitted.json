          "content_markdown": "When you convert torque values for **real hardware** (vehicles, machines, lab rigs), the math is only part of the story. To maintain safety and traceability:\n\n1. **Follow the original specification first.** If a service manual or engineering drawing is published in N·m (the SI unit), adjust your torque wrench to N·m when possible instead of converting.\n2. **Check your torque wrench scale.** Many click-type torque wrenches now show both lb·ft and N·m. Prefer direct readings in the unit of the specification whenever available.\n3. **Respect calibration intervals.** In professional environments, torque tools are typically calibrated on a schedule (e.g., annually or based on number of cycles) against a reference standard. This helps keep the relationship between the dial reading and actual applied torque within the tolerance defined by the manufacturer.\n4. **Account for tool extensions.** Using crowfoot adapters or long extensions changes the effective lever arm. Most manufacturers provide correction formulas—apply those before or after using this unit converter.\n5. **Document conversions for quality records.** In labs or regulated industries, keep a note of any unit conversions used in test procedures or reports so another engineer can reproduce or audit your work.\n\nFor deeper background, many mechanical engineering departments and metrology labs publish guides on torque application, uncertainty, and calibration based on SI traceability. Using SI units (N·m) in your calculations and logs usually makes it easier to align with those references."

        "answer_markdown": "One **foot-pound (lb·ft)** of torque is equal to **1.3558179483 newton-meters (N·m)**. This factor comes from the exact definitions of the pound-force, foot, newton, and meter in the SI and customary unit systems. For most practical engineering purposes, values rounded to **1.356** or **1.36** are sufficiently accurate, but this calculator uses the full constant internally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a difference between ft·lb, lb·ft, and foot-pound?",
        "answer_markdown": "In everyday practice, **ft·lb**, **lb·ft**, and **foot-pound** are often used interchangeably to describe torque. Strictly speaking, the torque unit is **pound-foot (lb·ft)**, indicating a pound-force applied one foot from the pivot. However, many service manuals and tools write **ft·lb**. This converter treats them as the same torque unit and assumes you are working with torque, not energy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise does my torque conversion need to be?",
        "answer_markdown": "It depends on your application:\n\n- **Automotive repair and general maintenance:** Specifications typically allow a tolerance of a few percent. Rounding to **1 decimal place** in N·m is usually acceptable.\n- **Mechanical design and lab work:** You may require 2–3 significant figures, especially when documenting design calculations or test protocols.\n- **Metrology or calibration labs:** Calculations may use many more significant figures, but the practical accuracy is limited by instrument calibration and environmental factors.\n\nThis converter lets you choose the number of decimals so your outputs match the level of precision your task requires."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this converter for dynamic or impact torque?",
        "answer_markdown": "The conversion factor between foot-pounds and newton-meters is strictly **unit-based** and does not change for dynamic or impact loads. However, measuring and specifying **impact or transient torque** is more complex and usually requires dedicated instrumentation and methods. For safety-critical or high-speed applications, rely on manufacturer data and test procedures rather than back-of-the-envelope conversions alone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do engineering courses recommend using N·m instead of ft·lb?",
        "answer_markdown": "Most university engineering programs and scientific publications follow the **International System of Units (SI)**, where **newton-meter (N·m)** is the standard unit of torque. Using N·m keeps equations, constants, and software libraries consistent and reduces the risk of mixing units. Converting older or imperial torque data into N·m before analysis is a simple way to align your work with these conventions."
