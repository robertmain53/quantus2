This conversion bridges global and regional engineering practices.","This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 BTU equals approximately 1,055.06 Joules."],"methodology":["1 BTU ≈ 1,055.06 J. To convert joules to BTU, divide by 1,055.06. For example, 1,055.06 J ≈ 1 BTU, 10,550.6 J = 10 BTU.","International HVAC research produces results in joules, but North American equipment specifications use BTU. Converting enables proper specification translation.","Engineering standards differ between regions. Converting between units enables international collaboration and technology transfer.","This converter provides precise energy conversions for HVAC design, equipment selection, and international engineering applications."],"examples":["Example 1 – Cooling capacity: A system producing 3,500,000 J/s converts to approximately 3,320 BTU/s, essential for AC unit selection.","Example 2 – Heating output: A furnace output of 500,000 J converts to approximately 474 BTU, needed for heater specifications.","Example 3 – Energy efficiency: Equipment using 1,000,000 J converts to approximately 948 BTU, useful for international efficiency comparisons."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from Joules to BTU?","answer":"1 BTU ≈ 1,055.06 J. Divide joules by 1,055.06 to get BTU."},{"question":"Why use BTU for HVAC systems?","answer":"BTU/h is the traditional standard in North America for rating air conditioning and heating equipment. Many systems still use this scale."},{"question":"How many joules in a typical AC rating?","answer":"A 10,000 BTU/h system = approximately 2.93 kW, or 2,930 J/s (watts)."}],"citations":[{"label":"NIST – Thermodynamic Units","url":"https://www.nist.gov/"},{"label":"Energy Engineering – Unit Conversions","url":"https://www.ashrae.org/"}],"glossary":[{"term":"Joule (J)","definition":"SI base unit of energy, standard in physics and international engineering."},{"term":"BTU","definition":"British Thermal Unit, traditional unit for HVAC and heating in North America."}]},"links":{"internal":["/conversions/energy/btu-to-joules-converter"],"external":[]},"schema":{"additionalTypes":["HowTo"]}}}
