    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a quantity measured in seconds into centuries using a fixed mathematical relationship. Because there are multiple common definitions of a century (calendar century using the Gregorian average year, a Julian/astronomical century, or a simple 100×365-day century), the tool uses the widely accepted Gregorian average-year definition by default for civilian and many engineering purposes.",
      "Conversions that span historical time or high-precision scientific use must account for leap seconds and the exact epoch definition. Leap seconds are irregular, applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and are not part of a simple seconds-to-centuries multiplicative conversion. See the methodology and citations for guidance on which definition to use for different contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary conversion uses the Gregorian average year length of 365.2425 days. This is the calendar arithmetic average used for civil date arithmetic in the Gregorian calendar and is widely used for calendar-based time-span conversions.",
      "For astronomical and some scientific contexts, a Julian century (defined as exactly 36,525 days or 36525 days) is commonly used; that definition is an exact day count and differs slightly from the Gregorian average-century value.",
      "Leap seconds are irregular one-second adjustments applied to UTC. They create discontinuities that cannot be captured by a single fixed seconds-per-century factor. For high-accuracy time interval work involving UTC, consult national time authorities and synchronization standards such as those published by NIST and IEEE."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition used (default): 1 century = 100 Gregorian average years; 1 Gregorian average year = 365.2425 days; 1 day = 86,400 seconds.",
      "Formula (Gregorian average): 1 century = 100 × 365.2425 × 86,400 = 3,155,695,200 seconds.",
      "Alternate definitions: Simple 100-year (no leap years): 100 × 365 × 86,400 = 3,153,600,000 seconds. Julian century (astronomy): 36,525 days × 86,400 = 3,155,760,000 seconds.",
      "Practical note: Use the Gregorian-average value for civil calendar spans; use the Julian-century value for astronomical epoch calculations; explicitly document the definition when reporting converted results."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 second = 3.170979198e-10 centuries (using Gregorian average where 1 century = 3,155,695,200 seconds).",
      "1,000,000,000 seconds ≈ 0.316887 (gigasecond to Gregorian-average centuries). Calculation: 1e9 / 3,155,695,200 ≈ 0.316887.",
      "3,155,695,200 seconds = 1 century (Gregorian average).",
      "3,155,760,000 seconds ≈ 1 Julian century (astronomical definition of 36,525 days)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many seconds are in one century?",
        "answer": "It depends on the century definition. Common values are: Gregorian average century = 3,155,695,200 seconds; Julian century = 3,155,760,000 seconds; simple 100×365-day century = 3,153,600,000 seconds. The converter uses the Gregorian average by default."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds change the conversion?",
        "answer": "Leap seconds are irregular adjustments to UTC and are not modeled by a single fixed conversion factor. If your interval crosses announced leap seconds and you need UTC-accurate duration, you must apply leap-second corrections from an authoritative list (see NIST). For routine calendar-span conversions, the Gregorian-average factor is appropriate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which definition should I use for engineering, legal, or payroll purposes?",
        "answer": "Use the definition required by the governing regulation or contract. For workplace recordkeeping and legal compliance consult local labor rules and recordkeeping standards. For synchronization and instrumentation, follow precision time standards such as IEEE 1588 and guidance from national timing authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the result from this converter?",
        "answer": "The multiplicative conversion is exact to the precision of the constants used. The Gregorian-average century factor yields exact integer seconds for that definition (3,155,695,200). Real-world accuracy versus UTC can differ by the accumulated count of leap seconds; for sub-second or epoch-accurate work consult authoritative time services."
