    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts power values expressed in kilowatts (kW) to megawatts (MW) using the exact SI prefix relationship. It is intended for quick, unambiguous unit conversions used in engineering, grid planning, renewable energy estimates, equipment ratings, and reporting.",
      "The converter implements the fixed mathematical relationship between SI prefixes and provides guidance on appropriate precision, common use cases, and how power units differ from energy units. For measurement traceability and safety considerations consult the standards and regulatory guidance referenced below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) prefix definitions: kilo (k) = 10^3 and mega (M) = 10^6. Because these are fixed decimal prefixes, the conversion is exact and lossless mathematically.",
      "Recommended presentation of results follows metrology and engineering practice: keep enough significant figures for the context (see IEEE and NIST guidance) and avoid implying measurement accuracy beyond instrument calibration. When using converted values in regulatory filings or safety calculations, follow applicable standards and workplace safety rules.",
      "Accuracy caveats: the numeric conversion is exact, but real-world measurements include instrument uncertainty, rounding, and reporting conventions. For traceable measurements and declared uncertainties, follow NIST and relevant ISO/IEC guidance and document calibration status."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "To convert kilowatts to megawatts divide the kilowatt value by 1,000. Example formula: MW = kW ÷ 1000.",
      "To convert megawatts to kilowatts multiply the megawatt value by 1,000. Example formula: kW = MW × 1000.",
      "For large or small values use scientific notation to preserve precision. The conversion itself is exact because it relies on decimal SI prefixes."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1500 kW = 1500 ÷ 1000 = 1.5 MW.",
      "0.75 kW = 0.75 ÷ 1000 = 0.00075 MW.",
      "500000 kW = 500000 ÷ 1000 = 500 MW."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between kilowatts and megawatts is exact because kilo and mega are defined as decimal SI prefixes (10^3 and 10^6). Any approximation comes from rounding or from measurement uncertainty in the original value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between power (kW, MW) and energy (kWh, MWh)?",
        "answer": "Power (watts, kilowatts, megawatts) is a rate of energy transfer at an instant. Energy (watt-hours, kilowatt-hours, megawatt-hours) is the integral of power over time. Do not interchange power and energy units; convert power to energy only by multiplying by a time interval."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report significant figures appropriate to the measurement uncertainty and the decision context. Follow lab or instrument calibration documentation and standards guidance such as NIST or IEEE recommendations. Do not imply greater precision than the original measurement supports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or regulatory considerations when using converted values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use converted values in safety calculations or regulatory reports only after ensuring measurement traceability, calibration status, and compliance with applicable standards and workplace rules. Refer to electrical safety regulations and industry standards for thresholds and reporting requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What symbols are standard for these units?",
        "answer": "The standard symbols are kW for kilowatt and MW for megawatt. Use uppercase M for mega and lowercase k for kilo following SI conventions."
