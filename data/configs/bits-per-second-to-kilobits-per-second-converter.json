    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates data rates expressed in bits per second (bps) to kilobits per second (kbps). In most networking and broadband contexts, the SI decimal prefix is used, where 1 kilobit (kb) = 1000 bits.",
      "We also explain the alternative binary interpretation (kibibit = 1024 bits), when it appears in legacy tools or storage contexts, and provide practical notes on measurement precision and how network overhead affects observed throughput."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary conversion uses the SI decimal prefix: divide the bit rate (bps) by 1,000 to get kilobits per second (kbps). This follows international metric conventions for kilo as 10^3.",
      "When systems or legacy tools use binary prefixes, a kibibit (Kibit) equals 1024 bits. Converting to kibibits per second requires dividing bps by 1024; this is distinct from the SI kilobit and is less common for network link-rate reporting.",
      "Practical measurement notes: instrument precision, protocol overhead (headers, framing, retransmits), and sampling windows all affect measured throughput. Use averaged samples and report units explicitly (kbps vs Kibit/s) to avoid ambiguity."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal kilobits per second (kbps): kbps = bps ÷ 1000",
      "Binary kibibits per second (Kibit/s): Kibit/s = bps ÷ 1024",
      "To convert to kilobytes per second (KB/s, decimal): KB/s = (bps ÷ 8) ÷ 1000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1500 bps → 1500 ÷ 1000 = 1.5 kbps (decimal kilobits per second).",
      "Example 2: 1500 bps → 1500 ÷ 1024 ≈ 1.4648 Kibit/s (binary kibibits per second).",
      "Example 3: 8000 bps → (8000 ÷ 8) ÷ 1000 = 1 KB/s (one kilobyte per second using decimal byte units)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is kbps equal to 1000 bps or 1024 bps?",
        "answer": "By SI metric convention, kbps uses kilo = 1,000, so 1 kbps = 1,000 bps. The 1,024 value belongs to binary prefixes (kibi, mebi) standardized for digital information; 1 kibibit (Kibit) = 1,024 bits. Always check whether the source uses SI (decimal) or binary prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my router report different speeds than my speed test?",
        "answer": "Router link rates often report physical-layer maximums while speed tests measure application-layer throughput. Factors such as protocol overhead (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP), encryption, retransmissions, and the test server path reduce observed throughput. Averaging measurements and specifying the unit (kbps vs Mbps) clarifies comparisons."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I display precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "Round to a number of significant digits appropriate for the measurement method. For small values (under 100), two decimal places can be useful; for large values, use integer or one decimal. Always show the unit and whether decimal (SI) or binary prefixes were used."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between kbps and KB/s?",
        "answer": "kbps (lowercase k, lowercase b) denotes kilobits per second. KB/s (uppercase B) denotes kilobytes per second; 1 byte = 8 bits. To convert bits per second to kilobytes per second, divide bps by 8, then by 1,000 for decimal kilobytes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there authoritative standards for these prefixes?",
        "answer": "Yes. SI (metric) prefixes such as kilo = 10^3 are defined by international standards bodies. Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi) are standardized for discrete data quantities. Use the standardized names to avoid ambiguity."
