1. This is a converter because it converts between two length/area units (square feet ↔ square meters) that have a fixed mathematical relationship, requires one numeric input, and returns one numeric output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown or HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, meta, schema_org, robots, form for converters, custom UI fields, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
