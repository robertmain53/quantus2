    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts electrical or mechanical power values expressed in kilowatts (kW) to metric horsepower (often abbreviated PS or mhp). The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship and is appropriate for reporting, documentation, and unit harmonization.",
      "Use the converter for single-value conversions where measurement precision and reporting standards matter. For measured engine or motor power, ensure the underlying measurement method and correction factors follow applicable measurement standards and calibration procedures before converting units."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the internationally accepted definitions of the units. Metric horsepower (Pferdestärke, PS) is defined such that 1 PS = 0.73549875 kW. The converter applies this fixed relationship and preserves significant figures according to user rounding rules.",
      "This page clarifies the numeric relationship, shows compact formula forms, offers examples, and flags practical accuracy considerations such as instrument calibration, measurement uncertainty, and applicable standards for reporting measured power."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: metric_hp = kilowatts ÷ 0.73549875",
      "Equivalent multiplication form: metric_hp = kilowatts × 1.3596216173033624",
      "Round only at the final step and keep at least 6 significant digits during intermediate calculations to reduce rounding error."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1.00 kW → 1.3596216 metric hp (1.0 ÷ 0.73549875 = 1.3596216173...).",
      "Example 2: 50 kW → 67.9810809 metric hp (50 ÷ 0.73549875 ≈ 67.981080865...).",
      "Example 3: 0.73549875 kW → 1.0000000 metric hp (by definition: 0.73549875 ÷ 0.73549875 = 1)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is metric horsepower and how does it differ from mechanical (imperial) horsepower?",
        "answer": "Metric horsepower (PS) is a unit historically used in many countries and is defined as 0.73549875 kilowatts. Mechanical or imperial horsepower (commonly used in the United States) has a slightly different value (approximately 0.74569987 kW). Use the appropriate horsepower variant for legal, technical, or specification contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The conversion is exact based on the defined constant (1 PS = 0.73549875 kW). Practical precision depends on the measurement uncertainty of the original kW value, instrument calibration, and rounding. Retain sufficient significant digits during calculation and round only for presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do measurement standards affect how I should convert reported power?",
        "answer": "Yes. When converting measured engine or motor power, ensure measurements conform to relevant standards (for example, standards covering measurement procedures, ambient corrections, and instrument calibration). The numeric conversion between units is independent of test method, but reporting must reference the measurement standard used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or regulatory considerations when measuring power?",
        "answer": "Yes. Follow occupational safety standards and safe work procedures when measuring machinery or engines. Consult applicable safety regulations, lockout/tagout procedures, and manufacturer guidance before performing measurements or adjustments."
