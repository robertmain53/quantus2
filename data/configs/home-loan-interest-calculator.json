    "introduction": [
      "This calculator compares standard monthly amortization to bi‑weekly payment schedules for a home loan. Enter the loan amount, annual interest rate (APR), term in years, and any optional additional amount you plan to add to each bi‑weekly payment.",
      "Results show the estimated monthly and bi‑weekly payment amounts, total interest paid under each schedule (using 26 bi‑weekly periods per year), estimated interest savings, total paid under a bi‑weekly schedule, and an approximate payoff time when making bi‑weekly payments including extras."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard amortization formulas converting the annual nominal rate to the period rate (monthly = annual/12, bi‑weekly = annual/26) and the standard annuity formula for level payments. For zero interest rate the calculator uses linear repayment to avoid division by zero.",
      "This tool provides deterministic mathematical estimates for comparison and planning. It does not account for lender-specific policies (for example, whether your lender applies bi‑weekly payments as credited halves of a monthly payment, posts payments immediately, or applies payments toward principal on receipt). Use the results for planning and discuss exact payoff timing with your lender."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Monthly payment formula: payment = r * P / (1 - (1+r)^-N) where r = annual_rate/100/12 and N = term_years*12. If r = 0, payment = P / N.",
      "Bi‑weekly payment base formula: same annuity formula with r = annual_rate/100/26 and N = term_years*26. Optional extra is added to each bi‑weekly payment.",
      "Total interest = (periodic payment * number of periods) - principal. Approximate bi‑weekly payoff time (years) is derived from the standard logarithmic formula for number of periods when payment differs from the base amortizing payment; if rate = 0 the payoff time is principal / payment divided by periods per year."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does a bi‑weekly schedule always save interest?",
        "answer": "Generally yes when bi‑weekly payments result in an extra equivalent monthly payment each year or when additional per‑payment principal is applied. Savings depend on exact payment amount, timing, and how the lender posts payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some calculators show different savings for the same inputs?",
        "answer": "Differences come from modeling choices: whether bi‑weekly is treated as 26 equal payments per year, whether half‑monthly payments are used, how interest is compounded, and whether lender posting rules or prepayment penalties are modeled."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these estimates?",
        "answer": "Estimates use standard amortization mathematics but are approximate for real‑world payoff timing. They do not substitute for lender statements or escrow/tax/fee calculations. See accuracy caveats and standards references below."
