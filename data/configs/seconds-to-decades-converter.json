    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a numeric value in seconds into calendar decades. It is designed for quick, deterministic unit conversion where a decade is treated as exactly ten Gregorian years, using the Gregorian average year length to account for leap years over long spans.",
      "The tool is intended for general-purpose conversions, planning, and educational use. For high-precision scientific or historical timekeeping (astronomical years, Julian years, or atomic timescales), consult the methodology and the cited standards to choose the appropriate definition."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base unit: the second is the SI base unit for time. This converter uses the international definition of the second as the SI unit and converts through calendar year length to decades.",
      "Decade definition used here: 1 decade = 10 × (Gregorian average year). The Gregorian average year is 365.2425 days. A day is 24 hours and an hour is 3600 seconds, so 1 day = 86,400 seconds. This choice balances common civil-calendar usage and leap-year averaging.",
      "Accuracy and scope: this converter gives a deterministic numeric result under the chosen assumptions. It is not intended for astronomical ephemeris calculations, precision time synchronization, or legal timestamping where leap seconds, UTC adjustments, or different year definitions may be required."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: 1 day = 24 × 3600 = 86,400 seconds.",
      "Step 2: Gregorian average year = 365.2425 days → 1 year = 365.2425 × 86,400 = 31,556,952 seconds.",
      "Step 3: 1 decade = 10 × 1 year = 10 × 31,556,952 = 315,569,520 seconds.",
      "Conversion formula: decades = seconds ÷ 315,569,520."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1,000,000,000 seconds → 1,000,000,000 ÷ 315,569,520 ≈ 3.16880878 decades (about 31.69 years).",
      "Example 2: 31,556,952 seconds → 31,556,952 ÷ 315,569,520 = 0.1 decades (exactly one Gregorian year under the chosen assumption)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does the converter use 365.2425 days per year?",
        "answer": "365.2425 days is the arithmetic average of a Gregorian calendar year (accounts for leap years over a 400-year cycle). This is a common civil standard for converting between calendar years and seconds when leap-year variation should be smoothed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you account for leap seconds or UTC adjustments?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds and UTC adjustments are discontinuous, administratively inserted events for keeping civil time aligned with Earth's rotation. This converter uses a continuous average year length and does not include leap seconds. For precise timekeeping with leap seconds, use time‑synchronization standards and tools that follow UTC and IERS announcements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What definition should I use for astronomical or scientific work?",
        "answer": "For astronomy or high-precision science, you may prefer a Julian year (exactly 365.25 days) or definitions consistent with the BIPM SI brochure and astronomical conventions. Consult relevant standards (BIPM, IAU) and domain-specific tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the numeric result?",
        "answer": "Precision depends on input precision and rounding. The underlying conversion constant here (1 decade = 315,569,520 seconds) is exact given the stated assumptions; however, when converting very large or very small values, roundoff and display formatting can affect the shown digits. See accuracy caveats in citations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert backwards (decades to seconds)?",
        "answer": "Yes. The inverse operation uses the same constant: seconds = decades × 315,569,520."
