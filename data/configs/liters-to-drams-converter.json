    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a volume value expressed in liters into drams using the standard US fluid dram definition unless otherwise specified. The tool is intended for quick, reliable unit conversion for laboratory, culinary, or general measurement tasks.",
      "Use this converter with awareness of the assumed dram variant (US fluid dram). For regulated work, verify the dram definition required by your procedure or jurisdiction and ensure measuring instruments are calibrated and traceable to national standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses fixed, internationally recognized relationships between metric and customary liquid volume units. The implementation assumes the US customary fluid ounce and its subdivision into fluid drams.",
      "Results are presented as a pure unit conversion without adding measurement uncertainty from instruments. For regulated measurements, apply instrument-specific uncertainty and calibration records traceable to national metrology institutes.",
      "Where multiple historical 'dram' definitions exist (for example, apothecary or weight-based dram units), this converter defaults to the US fluid dram. If a different dram definition is required, use the corresponding conversion factor for that variant."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base definitions used: 1 liter = 1000 milliliters; 1 US fluid ounce = 29.5735295625 milliliters; 1 US fluid dram = 1/8 US fluid ounce.",
      "Step 1: Convert liters to milliliters: milliliters = liters × 1000.",
      "Step 2: Convert milliliters to US fluid drams: drams = milliliters ÷ 3.6966911953125.",
      "Compact formula: drams = liters × 270.512181 (approximately).",
      "Rounding recommendation: show results to three significant figures for general use; retain more digits for engineering or calibration purposes and record instrument uncertainty separately."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 liter → 270.512 drams (US fluid dram) — exact factor yields 270.512181... drams.",
      "0.25 liters → 67.628 drams (approx).",
      "2 liters → 541.024 drams (approx)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This tool converts liters to US fluid drams using fixed unit relationships. It assumes the US fluid dram (1/8 US fluid ounce).",
      "For regulated measurements, confirm the required dram definition, apply instrument calibration and uncertainty, and follow the applicable standards referenced below."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which dram does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "By default this converter uses the US fluid dram (1 US fluid dram = 1/8 US fluid ounce ≈ 3.6966911953125 mL). Other historical or weight-based dram definitions are not used unless explicitly required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many drams are in 1 liter?",
        "answer": "Approximately 270.512 drams (US fluid dram). The exact conversion factor is about 270.512181 drams per liter."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle measurement uncertainty and calibration?",
        "answer": "This converter provides mathematical unit conversion only. For measurements used in regulated activities, record the uncertainty of the measuring device and ensure it is calibrated with traceability to a national metrology institute. Follow relevant standards and your laboratory quality system for uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there other dram variants I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "Yes. Historical or region-specific definitions include apothecary drams and dram as a unit of mass. Confirm which variant your workflow requires because values can differ. If in doubt, consult the procedure or standards governing your work."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision should I display?",
        "answer": "For everyday use, three significant figures are typically sufficient. For laboratory, engineering, or compliance work, preserve more digits internally and round only for reporting, documenting the associated measurement uncertainty."
