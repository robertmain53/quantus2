    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a volume entered in liters to the equivalent number of US fluid drams (fl dr). It assumes the US customary fluid dram (volume), not a dram of mass.",
      "Use this tool for quick conversions in lab notes, recipes, packaging labels, or documentation. For legal, medical, or trade uses verify the dram definition required by the regulating authority before finalizing any specification."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculation uses internationally recognized base definitions: 1 liter = 1000 milliliters (mL) and the US fluid dram is defined as 1/8 of a US fluid ounce. The US fluid ounce is defined in terms of the international millilitre value agreed by standards organizations.",
      "Where precision matters, ensure measuring instruments are calibrated per NIST or ISO guidance and report results with an appropriate number of significant digits and uncertainty estimates. This tool provides a deterministic mathematical conversion and does not include instrument or sampling uncertainty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert liters to milliliters: milliliters = liters × 1000.",
      "Step 2: Use the US fluid dram volume: 1 US fluid dram = (1/8) × 1 US fluid ounce = 3.6966911953125 mL.",
      "Step 3: Compute drams = (liters × 1000) ÷ 3.6966911953125. Example factor: 1 L ≈ 270.512181 fl dr (US)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 liter → 270.512181 fl dr (US) (approximately 270.512)",
      "0.5 liter → 135.256091 fl dr (US) (approximately 135.256)",
      "2 liters → 541.024362 fl dr (US) (approximately 541.024)"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which type of dram does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the US fluid dram (volume), defined as 1/8 of a US fluid ounce. It does not convert mass drams (avoirdupois or apothecary dram) nor imperial fluid drams unless specifically selected in a different converter."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Report decimals according to the precision of your measurement and the intended use. For routine non-regulatory uses 3 significant figures is commonly sufficient. For laboratory, legal, or quality-control use, follow the uncertainty reporting and significant-figure rules in NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there other dram definitions I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "Yes. There is an imperial fluid dram (based on imperial fluid ounce) and mass-based drams used historically in apothecary or weight systems. Those give slightly different numeric results. Use the dram variant required by your jurisdiction or process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement or calibration error?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides the mathematical conversion only. For measurement accuracy and traceability, calibrate instruments according to NIST or ISO procedures and document measurement uncertainty as appropriate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for regulatory labeling or safety data?",
        "answer": "Use this converter for preliminary calculations. For regulatory labeling, product specifications, safety data sheets, or legal documents, confirm unit definitions and rounding conventions required by the relevant authority and follow documented calibration and traceability procedures cited by standards bodies."
