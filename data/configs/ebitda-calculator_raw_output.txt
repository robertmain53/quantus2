1. This is a simple_calc because EBITDA requires multiple numeric inputs (net income, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, revenue, and optional adjustments) and computes one primary financial metric (EBITDA) plus a derived metric (EBITDA margin). It fits the "formula with multiple inputs → one primary output" definition.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content strictly as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, UI/layout fields, nor will I include a form for a converter or any extra custom keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
