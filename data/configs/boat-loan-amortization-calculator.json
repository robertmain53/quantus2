    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates periodic payments, total amount paid, and total interest for a boat loan under three common amortization approaches: monthly, bi‑weekly (standard), and accelerated bi‑weekly (half of the monthly payment every two weeks). Use the extra payment field to model additional principal paid each period.",
      "Results are numerical estimates intended for planning. They exclude lender fees, taxes, insurance, repossession costs, and other charges that may be included in a loan agreement. Confirm final terms with your lender."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard amortization formulas for fixed‑rate installment loans. Periodic rates are derived from the APR divided by the number of periods per year (12 for monthly, 26 for bi‑weekly). For accelerated bi‑weekly the tool computes the half‑monthly payment and applies it every two weeks (26 payments/year), which typically reduces principal faster than monthly payments.",
      "Numerical accuracy and rounding follow good engineering practice. Results are computed with double precision arithmetic where available; final displayed values are rounded to two decimal places for currency. This tool follows validation and quality assurance principles aligned with ISO quality process guidance and IEEE numerical computation recommendations. Data handling and integrity guidance references NIST best practices for information integrity."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic interest rate = APR / 100 / periods_per_year.",
      "Number of periods = term_years * periods_per_year.",
      "Periodic payment (if rate is greater than zero) = principal * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)); if the rate equals zero, payment = principal / n.",
      "Accelerated bi‑weekly payment (this tool) equals half the monthly payment, applied every two weeks (26 payments per year).",
      "Total paid = periodic payment (including extra) * number of periods. Total interest = total paid - principal."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $30,000 loan, 6.5% APR, 10 years. Monthly payment computed by monthly method; accelerated bi‑weekly shows faster principal reduction and lower total interest over the term.",
      "Example 2: Same loan with $20 extra per bi‑weekly period reduces term and interest; enter extra_payment to see impact."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does accelerated bi‑weekly always save interest?",
        "answer": "Typically yes: accelerated bi‑weekly (half the monthly payment every two weeks) results in 26 half‑payments per year, which is equivalent to 13 full monthly payments per year instead of 12, yielding extra principal reduction and lower total interest. Exact savings depend on APR, term, and any extra payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is APR the same as the periodic interest rate used here?",
        "answer": "APR is annual percentage rate. This calculator converts APR into a periodic rate by dividing APR by the number of periods per year (12 or 26). Some lenders quote APR differently (including fees); consult your loan documents for the effective rate and any finance charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are lender fees, taxes, or insurance included?",
        "answer": "No. This tool models amortization on the principal and APR only. Fees, insurance, taxes, and escrow items are excluded and must be added separately or clarified with your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these numbers?",
        "answer": "Values are theoretical estimates using standard amortization formulas and double precision arithmetic. Rounding and lender rounding conventions can produce small differences. For exact payoff schedules or regulatory disclosures, refer to lender statements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the APR is zero?",
        "answer": "If the APR is 0, the calculator divides principal evenly over the number of periods. No interest will be shown."
