1. This is a "converter" because the task is a fixed, single-step unit conversion between two area units (square meters ↔ square feet) where the user inputs one numeric value and expects one numeric output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or any other extra keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
