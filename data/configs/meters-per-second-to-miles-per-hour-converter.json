    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single speed value expressed in metres per second (m/s) to miles per hour (mph) using the exact international definitions of the metre and the international mile. The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship and does not depend on context-specific variables.",
      "Use this tool when you need a precise unit conversion for engineering calculations, lab reports, vehicle speed checks, or data display. The underlying factor is exact given the definitions: 1 international mile = 1609.344 metres, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds; the result should be rounded to the precision required by your use case."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies internationally accepted unit definitions. The metre is the SI base unit of length and the international mile is defined as exactly 1609.344 metres. Time is converted from seconds to hours using 3600 seconds per hour.",
      "Calculation uses the exact rational factor derived from those definitions. Displayed results are rounded only for presentation; the conversion factor itself is exact. For traceable measurement, follow instrument calibration and uncertainty statements in accordance with NIST and ISO guidance.",
      "Recommended practices: state the number of significant figures required, document the measurement instrument and its calibration date, and include an uncertainty estimate when results are used for regulatory or safety decisions. Refer to NIST and ISO standards for uncertainty evaluation and calibration procedures and to applicable workplace safety standards for operational limits."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Multiply metres per second by the number of seconds in an hour: m/s × 3600 = metres per hour.",
      "Step 2: Divide metres per hour by the number of metres in an international mile: (m/s × 3600) ÷ 1609.344 = miles per hour.",
      "Concise formula: mph = m/s × 3600 ÷ 1609.344. Numeric factor: 1 m/s = 2.2369362920544 mph (use required rounding for display)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 m/s → 1 × 2.2369362920544 = 2.2369362921 mph (typically displayed as 2.237 mph for 4 significant figures).",
      "10 m/s → 22.369362920544 mph (commonly presented as 22.37 mph).",
      "27.7777777778 m/s (which is 100 km/h) → 62.137119223733 mph (commonly displayed as 62.14 mph)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor is exact based on the international definitions: 1 mile = 1609.344 metres and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Any deviation in reported results comes from rounding for display or from measurement uncertainty in the input value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places to match the precision of your input and the requirements of your application. For general use, 3 to 4 significant figures are common. For calibrated instruments or laboratory work, follow the precision and uncertainty reporting requirements in NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion consider measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "This tool performs a mathematical unit conversion only. It does not estimate measurement uncertainty or calibration error. For traceable results include the instrument specification, calibration status, and an uncertainty budget following NIST and ISO procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion is linear and valid across magnitudes. Watch for numeric overflow or display rounding in consumer interfaces when values are extreme. For safety-critical systems check applicable industry standards and limits before using converted values operationally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I look for regulatory or safety limits related to speed?",
        "answer": "Regulatory and safety limits are application-specific. Consult relevant workplace safety and transportation regulations and standards. For workplace safety, refer to national occupational safety guidance and any industry-specific standards before acting on converted speed values."
