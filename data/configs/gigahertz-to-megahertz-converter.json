It is designed for RF engineers and telecommunications professionals.","Modern wireless systems use GHz notation, but detailed specifications and component datasheets often use MHz. Converting between these units is essential for system integration.","This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 gigahertz equals exactly 1,000 megahertz."],"methodology":["1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. To convert GHz to MHz, multiply by 1,000. For example, 2.4 GHz = 2,400 MHz, 5 GHz = 5,000 MHz, 28 GHz = 28,000 MHz.","Component specifications, frequency allocations, and technical documentation often use both units. Converting enables proper equipment selection and verification.","Frequency bands are specified in different units depending on context. Understanding both MHz and GHz ensures accurate system design and implementation.","This converter provides precise frequency conversions for RF engineering, system integration, and technical documentation."],"examples":["Example 1 – WiFi specification: 2.4 GHz WiFi converts to 2,400 MHz for detailed channel analysis.","Example 2 – Cellular frequency: 1.9 GHz cellular band converts to 1,900 MHz for equipment specification.","Example 3 – 5G system: 28 GHz millimeter wave converts to 28,000 MHz for component sourcing.","Example 4 – Frequency channel: A 100 MHz channel width at 5 GHz represents specific frequency range in MHz."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from GHz to MHz?","answer":"1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. Multiply GHz by 1,000 to get MHz."},{"question":"Why do different systems use different frequency units?","answer":"Historical convention and convenience. Older systems use MHz; modern systems use GHz. Both are valid; conversions enable system integration."},{"question":"How do I verify my frequency conversion is correct?","answer":"Use known reference frequencies: WiFi 2.4 GHz = 2,400 MHz, WiFi 5 GHz = 5,000 MHz. Verify your conversions against these standards."},{"question":"What frequency ranges are critical for wireless design?","answer":"2.4 GHz and 5 GHz for WiFi; 700 MHz to 2.6 GHz for cellular; 28+ GHz for 5G. Understanding these ranges is essential for product design."},{"question":"How do I select RF components for a frequency?","answer":"Equipment datasheets specify operating frequency in MHz or GHz. Convert as needed to match your design frequency. Verify that component frequency range covers your application."},{"question":"What is frequency tuning in RF systems?","answer":"The ability to adjust operating frequency within a band. Most RF systems can tune across their allocated band; conversion between MHz and GHz helps specify tuning range."},{"question":"How does frequency relate to antenna size?","answer":"Antenna size is inversely proportional to frequency. GHz-frequency antennas are much smaller than MHz-frequency antennas. This relationship is critical for device design."},{"question":"What is channel spacing?","answer":"The frequency separation between adjacent communication channels. Channel spacing is typically specified in MHz, even for GHz-band systems. Understanding this ensures proper frequency allocation."}],"citations":[{"label":"FCC – Frequency Allocation and Equipment Standards","url":"https://www.fcc.gov/"},{"label":"IEEE 802.11 – WiFi Technical Specifications","url":"https://www.ieee.org/"},{"label":"3GPP – Cellular Band Specifications and Frequencies","url":"https://www.3gpp.org/"},{"label":"ITU – Spectrum Regulation","url":"https://www.itu.int/"},{"label":"NIST – RF Measurement Standards","url":"https://www.nist.gov/"}],"glossary":[{"term":"Gigahertz (GHz)","definition":"1,000 Megahertz.
