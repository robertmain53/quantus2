    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a length in feet (ft) to meters (m) using the internationally agreed conversion factor. It is intended for quick conversions, engineering checks, and everyday use where unit consistency is required.",
      "The numeric conversion factor used here is exact by definition; guidance on rounding, measurement uncertainty, and traceability is provided to help you choose an appropriate display precision for your application."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed relationship between the foot and the metre established by international agreement. The metre is the SI base unit of length and the relationships among customary units are maintained for compatibility with SI.",
      "For measurement traceability and notation guidance we reference national and international standards. Use calibrated instruments and documented procedures when measurements affect safety, compliance, or contractual obligations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Use the exact conversion factor: 1 foot = 0.3048 metres.",
      "Calculation step: meters = feet × 0.3048.",
      "Rounding guidance: present results to a precision appropriate for the task (engineering checks often use 3 to 6 decimal places). Remember that the conversion factor itself is exact; measurement uncertainty comes from the input value and instruments."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5 ft → 5 × 0.3048 = 1.524 m",
      "6 ft 2 in: convert inches to feet first (6 + 2/12 = 6.1666667 ft) → 6.1666667 × 0.3048 ≈ 1.87962 m",
      "0.1 ft → 0.1 × 0.3048 = 0.03048 m"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Multiply feet by 0.3048 to obtain metres. The factor 0.3048 is exact by international definition; round results according to the required measurement precision.",
      "When converting measurements that originated from physical instruments, include instrument uncertainty and calibration records for any regulated, safety-critical, or contractual work."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is 1 foot equal to exactly 0.3048 meters?",
        "answer": "Yes. By international agreement the inch is defined as exactly 0.0254 metres, making one foot exactly 0.3048 metres. The conversion factor is exact; uncertainty comes from how the input value was measured or rounded."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Depends on context. For simple everyday use 2–3 decimal places are usually fine. For engineering or surveying tasks 3–6 decimal places may be appropriate. For legal or safety-critical contexts, follow the precision specified in contracts or standards and include measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do two calculators give slightly different results?",
        "answer": "Differences usually stem from display rounding or from how the input was entered (for example, converting feet and inches vs entering feet as a decimal). The underlying exact factor is the same; check input format and rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Yes, but beware of floating-point precision limits in software. For extremely large or precise values use software or libraries that support arbitrary precision arithmetic and keep track of significant figures and instrument uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do standards or regulators require calibration or documentation?",
        "answer": "Standards bodies and regulators recommend or require traceable calibration of measurement instruments for regulated work. Maintain calibration certificates and follow relevant guidance when measurements affect compliance, safety, or contracts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert from feet and inches?",
        "answer": "Convert inches to feet first by dividing inches by 12, add to feet, then multiply the total feet by 0.3048 to get metres."
