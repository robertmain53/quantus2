    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a volume entered in liters to teaspoons. It is intended for both everyday uses such as cooking and for quick scientific or educational conversions where a fixed unit relationship applies.",
      "The tool shows the conversion based on standard defined volumes and includes guidance about US versus metric teaspoon definitions, expected precision, and when to prefer laboratory-grade measurement methods."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed by mapping both units to a common base (milliliters) and applying a fixed arithmetic ratio. This is a pure unit conversion; no temperature, pressure, or substance density adjustments are applied.",
      "When precision matters, results follow best practices from measurement standards. See NIST and the international guidance on units and uncertainty for proper rounding, calibration, and reporting of measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert liters to milliliters: milliliters = liters × 1000.",
      "Step 2 (US teaspoon): teaspoons (US) = milliliters ÷ 4.92892159375. That is, teaspoons = liters × 1000 ÷ 4.92892159375.",
      "Alternative (metric teaspoon): some contexts define a teaspoon as exactly 5 milliliters. Using that convention: teaspoons (metric) = liters × 1000 ÷ 5.",
      "Rounding: choose precision appropriate for the context. For culinary use, rounding to 0.1 teaspoon is usually acceptable. For laboratory or regulatory reporting, follow the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and report uncertainty alongside the value."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 0.75 L → using US teaspoon factor: 0.75 × 1000 ÷ 4.92892159375 ≈ 152.289 tsp (US).",
      "Example 2: 0.25 L → using metric teaspoon (5 mL): 0.25 × 1000 ÷ 5 = 50 tsp (metric)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which teaspoon definition does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "The default conversion uses the common teaspoon unit. For clarity, the calculation notes include both the US teaspoon (1 US tsp = 4.92892159375 mL) and the metric teaspoon convention (1 metric tsp = 5 mL). Check which convention is required for your recipe or specification."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the result and what about rounding?",
        "answer": "The numerical conversion is exact for the chosen fixed factors. Practical accuracy depends on input precision and the teaspoon definition used. For casual use, round to one decimal place. For scientific or regulatory use, include an uncertainty estimate and follow measurement and calibration standards (see citations)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I prefer milliliters or liters instead of teaspoons?",
        "answer": "Use milliliters or liters for precise dosing, laboratory work, or regulatory records. Teaspoons are primarily convenient for informal cooking measurements and may introduce rounding differences between 4.9289 mL and 5 mL conventions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to account for temperature or density?",
        "answer": "No. Converting liters to teaspoons is a pure volume-to-volume conversion and does not depend on temperature or density. If you need to convert mass to volume or vice versa, you must supply density and apply appropriate formulas."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document conversions for compliance or lab records?",
        "answer": "Record the numeric value, the unit definitions (e.g., US teaspoon = 4.92892159375 mL), the rounding rule, and an estimate of measurement uncertainty. Follow guidance in recognized standards for traceability and calibration."
