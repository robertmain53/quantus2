    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a data-rate value given in megabits per second (Mbps or Mb/s) into megabytes per second (MB/s or MB/s). It follows the standard relationship between bits and bytes used in telecommunications and computing.",
      "Most network providers and speed tests report throughput in bits per second. Because 1 byte equals 8 bits, the straightforward mathematical step is to divide a megabit value by 8 to get the corresponding megabyte value. For users concerned with binary vs decimal prefixes, both variants and their practical impact are explained below.",
      "Use the examples and measurement guidance here to interpret advertised speeds, to plan transfers, or to size links and storage pipelines. Citations to authoritative standards (NIST, FCC) and practical measurement guidance are included for transparency."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the fixed relationship: 1 byte = 8 bits. For decimal SI-prefixed units commonly used by network carriers, 1 megabit = 1,000,000 bits and 1 megabyte = 1,000,000 bytes.",
      "When binary-prefixed units are relevant (MiB, Mib), the base is 2: 1 mebibyte (1 MiB) = 2^20 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes. This matters when software reports sizes in MiB/s rather than MB/s; both interpretations are shown in examples.",
      "Practical throughput measured on a network will be affected by protocol overhead (TCP/IP headers, encryption), link-layer framing, and congestion. The converter gives the pure unit transformation; expected real-world transfer rates should account for 5–15% overhead depending on protocol and packetization."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal MB/s (common ISP convention): MB/s = Mbps ÷ 8.",
      "Binary MiB/s (where software uses mebibytes): MiB/s = (Mbps × 1,000,000 ÷ 8) ÷ 1,048,576 = (Mbps ÷ 8) × (1,000,000 ÷ 1,048,576).",
      "Practical note: advertised Mbps typically use decimal prefixes (1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits/s). Some operating-system transfer displays use binary bytes (MiB)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 Mbps → 12.5 MB/s (decimal MB/s) — calculation: 100 ÷ 8 = 12.5",
      "100 Mbps → ~11.92 MiB/s (binary mebibyte) — calculation: (100 × 1,000,000 ÷ 8) ÷ 1,048,576 ≈ 11.9209",
      "50 Mbps → 6.25 MB/s; 10 Mbps → 1.25 MB/s; 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps) → 125 MB/s"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Do I always divide Mbps by 8 to get MB/s?",
        "answer": "Yes for a pure unit conversion: 1 byte = 8 bits, so MB/s = Mbps ÷ 8. Be aware of decimal vs binary prefix differences (MB vs MiB) which affect the numeric result when software reports in MiB/s."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Mb (or Mbps) and MB (or MB/s)?",
        "answer": "Mb (lowercase b) stands for megabit while MB (uppercase B) stands for megabyte. Bits measure digital signaling rate; bytes are groups of 8 bits commonly used for storage and file sizes. Lowercase b (bits) vs uppercase B (bytes) is the standard convention."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my file transfer show lower speeds than the converted value?",
        "answer": "Observed transfer rates are lower due to protocol and framing overhead (TCP/IP headers, encryption), flow control and congestion, disk I/O limits, and measurement method. Expect overhead of several percent; encrypted or small-packet transfers can add more overhead."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which should I use for planning: MB/s or MiB/s?",
        "answer": "For network planning and ISP advertised speeds, use decimal MB/s (SI convention). For software that reports transfer size using binary units, use MiB/s to compare apples-to-apples. This converter shows both approaches in examples."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are megabit and megabyte defined by standards?",
        "answer": "Yes. SI decimal prefixes (kilo, mega, giga) are the official metric system prefixes. International standards bodies and national metrology institutes document these conventions; where binary prefixes are used for computing, standards (IEC) define mebibyte, gibibyte, etc."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I test my actual speed to validate conversions?",
        "answer": "Use a wired connection to eliminate Wi‑Fi variability, test at off-peak times, run multiple tests with reputable speed-measurement tools, ensure no other applications are saturating the link, and compare average values. Consult FCC and NTIA measurement guidance for methodology."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for packet-level overhead like TCP/IP?",
        "answer": "No — this tool performs a unit conversion only (bits ⇄ bytes). To estimate effective throughput, subtract expected protocol and framing overhead from the converted result; typical guidance and studies are available from standards agencies and regulatory test programs."
