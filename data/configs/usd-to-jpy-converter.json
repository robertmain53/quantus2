    "introduction": [
      "Convert a value from US dollars (USD) into Japanese yen (JPY) using prevailing market exchange rates. Results shown are calculated from the stated mid-market rate and do not automatically include bank or provider fees.",
      "This converter uses the standard financial convention: multiply the USD amount by the exchange rate quoted as JPY per 1 USD. Display precision follows ISO 4217 minor-unit rules (JPY typically has 0 fractional digits)."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Rates are sourced from reputable market data feeds aggregated from interbank and public central-bank references and expressed as the mid-market (spot) exchange rate. For transparency we reference standards and official rate publications from central banks and international financial authorities.",
      "The converter multiplies the USD amount by the quoted JPY-per-USD spot rate, then applies currency-specific rounding rules. Display rounding follows ISO 4217 minor unit guidance (for JPY, round to whole yen for final display, while intermediate calculations retain extra precision).",
      "This tool is informational. Actual executed rates for bank transfers, card payments, or cash exchanges may differ due to provider spreads, commissions, timing, and local regulatory controls (AML/KYC). Consult your payment provider for final settled amounts."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Obtain the spot exchange rate expressed as JPY per 1 USD (rate).",
      "Multiply: result_jpy = amount_usd × rate.",
      "Apply internal precision for calculation (retain at least 6 significant digits), then round the final displayed value according to ISO 4217 minor units (JPY → round to nearest whole yen).",
      "If converting from JPY to USD, invert the rate: result_usd = amount_jpy ÷ rate."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where do the exchange rates come from?",
        "answer": "Rates come from live market data aggregators and are cross-checked against official central-bank publications and international financial datasets. See the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and IMF pages in the citations for authoritative references."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the converted amount differ from my bank or payment app?",
        "answer": "Banks and payment providers add a spread or fees to the mid-market rate and may use different execution times. This tool shows the mid-market (spot) rate only and does not include provider-specific fees, commissions, or correspondent bank charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often are rates updated and what time is used?",
        "answer": "Rates update continuously during market hours from data feeds; the timestamp shown with each conversion indicates the last update. For settlement or legal purposes, use the timestamp published by your executing provider or the central bank reference they rely on."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is rounding handled for JPY?",
        "answer": "Calculations keep high internal precision and round the final displayed amount according to ISO 4217 minor-unit rules. The Japanese yen has 0 minor units, so the final displayed amount is rounded to the nearest whole yen unless a provider specifies otherwise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this include taxes, reporting, or regulatory limits?",
        "answer": "No. Tax implications, reporting thresholds, and regulatory requirements (for example AML/KYC or cross-border reporting) depend on jurisdiction and transaction type. Consult relevant government guidance or your financial institution for regulatory or tax treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool suitable for large-value transfers?",
        "answer": "This converter provides an estimate using spot rates. For large-volume transfers, contact liquidity providers or banks for firm quotes, as market impact, limits, and bespoke fees can materially change the executed rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I verify the source rate used for a conversion?",
        "answer": "Verify the timestamp and reference source published with the rate. For audit or reconciliation, use central bank publications or official statistical releases (Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, IMF) listed in the citations."
