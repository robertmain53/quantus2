    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a single speed value expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h) into miles per second (mi/s). The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship based on the international definitions of the kilometer and the mile and the length of an hour in seconds.",
      "Use this tool when you need a quick, deterministic conversion for calculations, simulations, logging, or reporting. For instrument calibration, regulatory compliance, or safety-critical systems, review the methodology and cited standards and consider measurement uncertainty and calibration procedures."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on two exact unit relationships used in international measurement practice: 1 kilometer equals 0.6213711922373339 miles (based on the statute mile definition of 1 mi = 1609.344 m), and 1 hour equals 3600 seconds. The calculation is therefore deterministic and does not depend on contextual factors.",
      "For regulated or safety-critical applications, follow calibration and traceability guidance such as ISO/IEC 17025 for laboratory calibration and NIST traceability recommendations to document measurement uncertainty and maintain compliance. Relying solely on a numeric conversion without accounting for instrument error and sampling can lead to incorrect operational decisions.",
      "Round only as needed for display or interfacing with other systems. When integrating converted values into control loops, physics models, or official records, include the applied precision and uncertainty budgets in line with industry standards (ISO, NIST, IEEE) and workplace safety rules (OSHA) where relevant."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilometers to miles using the factor 1 km = 0.6213711922373339 mi.",
      "Step 2: Convert hours to seconds using 1 hour = 3600 seconds.",
      "Formula: miles_per_second = kilometers_per_hour × 0.6213711922373339 ÷ 3600. Concise form: mi/s = km/h × 0.0001726031090103705."

    "examples": [
      "1 km/h = 0.0001726031090103705 mi/s (useful as a base unit check).",
      "90 km/h = 90 × 0.0001726031090103705 = 0.015534279810933345 mi/s (typical vehicle speed example).",
      "100 km/h = 0.01726031090103705 mi/s (round to 0.01726 mi/s for display; preserve full precision for calculations)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many miles per second is 1 km/h?",
        "answer": "One kilometer per hour equals 0.0001726031090103705 miles per second. Use the full factor for internal calculations and round only for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion uses the defined relationship between the kilometer and the statute mile and the exact duration of an hour, so the arithmetic is exact given those definitions. Practical measurements of speed carry additional uncertainty from instruments and sampling; account for those when precision matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I worry about calibration or standards?",
        "answer": "If converted speeds are used in compliance reporting, safety controls, performance verification, or legal records, follow ISO/IEC 17025 for calibration traceability and document measurement uncertainty per NIST guidance and applicable industry or workplace standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why provide miles per second instead of miles per hour?",
        "answer": "Miles per second is a unit useful for high-speed contexts, scientific calculations, or simulations where seconds are the time step. For most everyday contexts, miles per hour may be more practical; choose the unit that matches the model or regulatory requirement."
