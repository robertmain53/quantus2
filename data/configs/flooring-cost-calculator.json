    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates the installed cost of a flooring project by combining material, labor, waste allowance, underlayment, removal, trim, fixed charges, and sales tax. Enter measured area and local unit costs to produce an itemized total and unit cost per square foot.",
      "Results are intended for planning and budgeting. For a formal bid, measure onsite and request written quotes from licensed installers; local labor rates, substrate condition, complex layouts, or required permits can materially change final price."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We calculate material quantity by applying the user-specified waste percentage to the measured area, then multiply by the material unit price to get total material cost.",
      "Labor is estimated as a simple area-based rate (cost per sq ft) which covers time and standard installation steps. Additional items (underlayment, removal, trim, and flat fees) are calculated separately and summed to a subtotal.",
      "Sales tax is applied to the subtotal using the provided tax rate. Outputs include both per-item totals and aggregated totals so you can adjust line items independently.",
      "For guidance on typical installer wages and occupational data, consult official labor statistics. For measurement best practices and safety/performance standards see national standards bodies and building science resources."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Material area including waste = area_sqft × (1 + waste_percent / 100)",
      "Material cost = material area including waste × material_cost_per_sqft",
      "Labor cost = area_sqft × labor_cost_per_sqft",
      "Additional costs = (area_sqft × underlayment_cost_per_sqft) + (area_sqft × removal_cost_per_sqft) + (trim_length_ft × trim_cost_per_ft) + additional_flat_cost",
      "Subtotal = material cost + labor cost + additional costs",
      "Tax = Subtotal × (sales_tax_percent / 100)",
      "Total = Subtotal + Tax",
      "Cost per sq ft = Total / area_sqft"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: 200 sq ft, $4.00 material, 10% waste, $2.00 labor, $0.50 underlayment → material area = 220 sq ft; material = $880; labor = $400; underlayment = $100; subtotal = $1,380; adjust tax and fixed fees to get total.",
      "Use a higher waste percent (12–15%) for diagonal patterns, large-format tiles, or layouts with many cuts; corners and stair work often increase labor beyond the area-based estimate—quote separately when needed."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these estimates?",
        "answer": "This tool gives a planning-level estimate based on user inputs. Accuracy depends on input precision (measured area, real local prices), substrate condition, and project complexity. Expect final contractor bids to vary; use this estimate to compare scenarios and prepare budgets."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose a waste percentage?",
        "answer": "Common waste allowances: 5–8% for straight-run materials, 8–12% for tiles with patterns or lots of cuts, and 12–20% for diagonal or complex layouts. Include extra for damaged or batch-mismatched boards. When in doubt, consult your installer or supplier."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find local labor rates?",
        "answer": "Labor rates vary by region and installer skill. Official occupational and wage statistics published by national labor agencies provide a reference; contact local installers for current market pricing and ask for detailed written estimates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include permits or subfloor repair?",
        "answer": "No—permits, structural repairs, moisture mitigation, or subfloor replacement are not included unless entered as 'Other fixed costs'. These items can be significant; inspect the site or ask a contractor for a formal assessment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for different units (metric)?",
        "answer": "This calculator uses square feet and US currency by default. Convert your measurements and unit prices into the same units before entering values. For consistent unit conversion references consult national metrology resources."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the calculator ask for underlayment separately?",
        "answer": "Underlayment is often priced and installed separately from the finish material; including it as a separate line ensures more accurate budgeting because materials and installation rules differ by floor type."
