    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a numeric quantity expressed in seconds to its equivalent number of days using the International System of Units (SI) relationship that defines one day as 24 hours or 86,400 seconds.",
      "The converter is intended for general-purpose calculations, reporting, and quick checks. For work that depends on legal timekeeping, regulated reporting, or high-precision time synchronization, consult the standards and measurement authorities referenced below.",
      "Accuracy notes and operational limits are provided so you can decide whether this simple conversion is appropriate for your use case or whether you need atomic-time or leap-second-aware procedures."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the exact SI arithmetic identity: 1 day = 24 hours = 24 × 60 minutes × 60 seconds = 86,400 seconds. The tool divides the input seconds by 86,400 to produce days.",
      "This converter does not apply calendar corrections (no leap-second insertion/removal, no time zone or daylight-saving adjustments). It performs a pure mathematical unit conversion from seconds to days.",
      "For applications requiring synchronized clocks or legal timestamps, follow guidance from national timekeeping authorities and precision-time standards (see citations). For networked time synchronization use NTP or IEEE 1588 (PTP) as appropriate."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Define: 1 day = 86,400 seconds.",
      "Formula: days = seconds ÷ 86,400",
      "Rounding: display rounding is configurable in the user interface; internal calculation uses standard double-precision arithmetic. For integer-second inputs, fractional days will typically be shown as decimal values."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "3600 seconds → 3600 ÷ 86,400 = 0.041666666666666664 days (equivalent to 1 hour)",
      "86,400 seconds → 86,400 ÷ 86,400 = 1 day",
      "172,800 seconds → 172,800 ÷ 86,400 = 2 days"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for leap seconds?",
        "answer": "No. This conversion uses the SI definition where 1 day = 86,400 seconds. Leap seconds are occasional one-second adjustments applied to UTC by international authorities and are not part of a pure unit conversion. For timestamping or elapsed-time calculations that must reflect UTC with leap seconds, consult NIST, IERS, and your time-distribution system."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding and precision limitations should I expect?",
        "answer": "Calculations are performed with standard double-precision arithmetic (IEEE 754). That gives a very wide dynamic range but integer exactness only up to about 9 × 10^15. For extremely large second counts or when exact integer arithmetic is required, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or integer-based libraries to avoid rounding errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this appropriate for legal or regulatory timekeeping (payroll, safety logs)?",
        "answer": "This converter is suitable for simple conversions and estimates. For legal or regulatory recordkeeping, follow applicable local regulations and employer guidance. Where regulations require synchronized timestamps or specific time standards, rely on authoritative sources and documented timekeeping systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle time zones and daylight saving time?",
        "answer": "This conversion is purely unit-based and does not handle time zones, calendar dates, or daylight saving rules. Convert timestamps to a consistent time base (for example UTC) before applying date arithmetic that requires calendar context."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I use for high-precision measurement or synchronization?",
        "answer": "For high-precision needs use atomic time references and synchronization protocols such as NTP or IEEE 1588 (Precision Time Protocol). Verify equipment calibration and follow best practices from national metrology institutes."
