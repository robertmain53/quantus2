    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a pressure value from pounds per square inch (psi) to kilopascals (kPa). The relationship is fixed and deterministic, so a single input returns a single primary output.",
      "The converter includes guidance on numerical accuracy, recommended significant figures for common uses (tyre pressure, laboratory measurements, industrial gauges), and references to standards and safety agencies for calibration and compliance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the defined SI relationship between the pascal and pound-force per square inch. One psi equals 6894.757293168 pascals, which equals 6.894757293168 kilopascals. This value is based on internationally accepted definitions of force and area.",
      "For user-facing results we recommend returning at least three significant figures for general use and more (4–6) when used in laboratory or calibration contexts. Always consider the accuracy and calibration of the originating instrument before reporting converted values.",
      "For regulatory or safety-critical applications consult applicable standards and calibration certificates. Relevant organizations include NIST for unit definitions and traceability, ISO for measurement standards (for example ISO 80000 series on quantities and units), IEEE standards where instrumentation electronics are involved, and OSHA for workplace pressure and safety limits."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply the value in psi by 6.894757293168 to get kilopascals.",
      "Formula: kPa = psi × 6.894757293168.",
      "Round results according to context: use 3 significant figures for everyday tasks, 4–6 for engineering calculations, and follow instrument calibration uncertainty for compliance reporting."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 30 psi × 6.894757293168 = 206.84271879504 kPa → report 206.8 kPa (3 s.f.) for tyre pressure.",
      "Example 2: 0.145 psi × 6.894757293168 = 1.000 (approximately) kPa → useful when converting small vacuum/pressure differentials; preserve extra digits if feeding into further calculations."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The numerical factor used is based on exact definitions of the base units and widely published conversion constants. In practice the conversion is deterministic, but the meaningful accuracy of a converted result is limited by the precision and calibration of the original measurement device."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Use 2–3 meaningful digits for consumer tasks (tyre pressure, HVAC checks). Use 4–6 digits for engineering calculations or when the upstream instrument report has corresponding precision. For official measurements include instrument uncertainty from calibration certificates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "This converter provides the arithmetic conversion only. For regulatory reporting check the specific agency requirements and include instrument calibration traceability. Refer to standards from NIST and ISO and follow local OSHA or equivalent workplace safety thresholds."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does temperature or altitude affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. The unit conversion between psi and kPa is a mathematical unit relationship and does not change with temperature or altitude. However, measured pressure values from sensors or gauges can vary with environmental conditions; account for sensor compensation and calibration when measuring."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle rounding when chaining calculations?",
        "answer": "Keep full precision in intermediate steps and round only at the final result to avoid cumulative rounding error. When results are reported, include uncertainty or significant figures appropriate to the measurement context."
