    "introduction": [
      "This calculator provides multiple commonly used approaches to estimate how much life insurance coverage you may need. It supports needs-based, income-replacement, human-life-value, and debts-and-final-expenses methods so you can compare results and choose a prudent target.",
      "Results depend on user inputs and assumptions about investment returns, inflation, and survivor resources. Use the estimates as planning guidance only; consult a licensed financial professional or actuarial advisor for a comprehensive, personalized recommendation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies standard actuarial and financial math: present-value calculations for income replacement and discounted future earnings for human-life-value. For immediate needs it sums debts and final expenses then subtracts readily available survivor resources.",
      "Model and operational practices align with recognized guidance for financial calculation rigor and information security. For example, use of tested numerical methods and validation is consistent with NIST recommendations for numerical software testing and ISO guidelines for financial services quality management. This tool is not a substitute for professional advice."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Needs-based: Recommended = PV(income replacement) + Education needs + Immediate needs (debts + final expenses) - Available resources.",
      "Income-replacement (PV): PV = Annual replacement × (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r, where r = expected investment return (decimal) and n = years to replace.",
      "Human Life Value (HLV): HLV ≈ Discounted sum of projected earnings over the planning horizon using the same PV annuity formula.",
      "Debts & final expenses: Simple sum of outstanding debts and final expenses minus immediate survivor resources.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these estimates?",
        "answer": "Estimates are approximate and depend on input accuracy and assumptions (returns, inflation, years of income replacement). They do not account for taxes, changing future earnings, or complex household needs. Use them for planning, not as a binding financial guarantee."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method should I use?",
        "answer": "Needs-based is comprehensive for most households because it combines immediate obligations and future income needs. Income-replacement and HLV provide complementary viewpoints. Consider multiple methods to create a range and consult a licensed advisor for a final insurance decision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these calculations compliant with standards?",
        "answer": "The calculation logic follows widely accepted financial math. For process controls, testing, and data handling, this tool references best-practice frameworks and standards listed in citations. It is not a regulatory filing or actuarial certification."

        "question": "What if expected investment return is zero?",
        "answer": "If the expected investment return is zero, present-value annuity formulas degenerate to simple multiplication (annual replacement × years). The tool's formulas assume a nonzero rate for discounting; for a zero or near-zero rate results should be interpreted cautiously."

      {
        "question": "Can I rely solely on this calculator to buy a policy?",
        "answer": "No. Use this calculator to inform discussions. Final policy selection should consider underwriting, premium affordability, policy type, riders, and the advice of a licensed insurance agent or financial planner."
