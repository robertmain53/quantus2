    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass expressed in kilograms (kg) to micrograms (µg). The relationship is a fixed SI scaling based on metric prefixes, so conversion is deterministic and suitable for calculators, lab notes, and documentation.",
      "Use the converter for quick numeric transformations, and consult the methodology and accuracy notes below when using results in calibrated measurements, regulatory reporting, or safety calculations."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the International System of Units (SI) prefix definition: micro- means 10^-6 and kilo- means 10^3. Converting between units with these prefixes is a matter of multiplying or dividing by powers of ten.",
      "For traceable laboratory or regulatory work, report converted values with uncertainty and the number of significant figures consistent with instrument calibration and standards such as NIST and ISO practice documents.",
      "Be mindful that the calculator gives an exact arithmetic conversion. When applying converted values in measurements, apply measurement uncertainty, instrument tolerance, and any rounding rules required by your governing standards or procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with the mass in kilograms (kg).",
      "Step 2: Apply the conversion factor: 1 kilogram = 1,000,000,000 micrograms.",
      "Formula: micrograms = kilograms × 1,000,000,000 (i.e., kg × 10^9)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 0.001 kg = 0.001 × 10^9 µg = 1,000,000 µg.",
      "Example 2: 2.5 kg = 2.5 × 10^9 µg = 2,500,000,000 µg (can be written as 2.5e9 µg)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between kilograms and micrograms using SI prefixes is exact: 1 kg = 10^9 µg. Practical measurements that produce the input value are subject to uncertainty and instrument tolerance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use µg or mcg notation?",
        "answer": "The SI symbol for microgram is µg. In contexts where the Greek letter mu is unavailable, mcg is a widely used ASCII alternative. Follow the notation rules of your organization or the applicable standard."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report after conversion?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the precision of the original measurement and the calibrated resolution of your instrument. Do not introduce additional precision by conversion alone; include measurement uncertainty where relevant."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small values safely?",
        "answer": "Yes, but be aware of numeric limits in software or devices. For extremely large values, consider scientific notation (for example, 1e9 µg). When using converted values in compliance or safety calculations, validate numeric range and rounding rules required by the governing standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for regulatory exposure calculations?",
        "answer": "You can use this as the arithmetic conversion step, but regulatory compliance typically requires documented measurement methods, calibrated instruments, uncertainty budgets, and adherence to applicable standards and agency guidance such as NIST and OSHA documents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator include measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs the arithmetic unit conversion only. For uncertainty analysis, combine instrument uncertainty, calibration certificate values, and propagation rules from ISO and NIST guides."
