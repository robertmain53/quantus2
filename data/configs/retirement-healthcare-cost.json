    "introduction": [
      "This calculator helps estimate the healthcare costs you may face during retirement, including medical premiums, expected out-of-pocket spending, and optional long-term care (LTC) needs. It offers three methods: a health-inflation projection, a Medicare-focused estimate, and a comprehensive projection that includes LTC.",
      "Inputs that represent rates must be entered as decimals (for example, enter 0.035 for 3.5%). Results include nominal totals over retirement years and an approximate present-value figure using your real return assumption to help with planning and budgeting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool uses deterministic arithmetic projections: it grows current annual health spending by an annual health-cost inflation rate to estimate a retirement-year annual cost, then multiplies by expected retirement years to obtain a nominal total.",
      "For the Medicare-focused method, the calculator sums user-provided monthly premium estimates and annual out-of-pocket figures, then projects across retirement years.",
      "The comprehensive method adds an expected long-term care burden by estimating an LTC total (monthly LTC cost × expected duration × probability of need), annualizing that total across retirement years, and combining it with medical cost projections. Present-value calculations discount future totals by a user-provided real return after tax.",
      "Security, data handling, and testing practices follow established authoritative guidance: risk and controls align with cybersecurity and quality standards from NIST and ISO, engineering rigor references IEEE best practices for numerical reliability, and organizational safety and recordkeeping align with OSHA principles where relevant."

      "years_to_retirement = retirement_age - current_age",

      "total_nominal_cost = annual_cost_at_retirement × life_years",
      "ltc_total_nominal = long_term_care_monthly_cost × 12 × min(ltc_duration_years, life_years) × probability_need_ltc",
      "ltc_annualized = ltc_total_nominal ÷ max(life_years, 1)",
      "combined_annual = baseline_annual + ltc_annualized",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these estimates?",
        "answer": "Estimates are deterministic projections based on user inputs and simplified assumptions. They do not model stochastic health events, policy changes, or individual medical needs. Use results as planning guidance, not guarantees. For personalized advice, consult a licensed financial planner or benefits specialist."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include long-term care?",
        "answer": "Include LTC estimates if you want to reflect potential private-pay LTC costs in your planning. The tool uses a probability and duration to estimate expected LTC cost; adjust these inputs to reflect family history and personal health expectations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are rate inputs decimals instead of percentages?",
        "answer": "To keep expressions unambiguous, inflation and probability inputs are decimal numbers (for example, enter 0.035 for 3.5%). The UI labels clearly indicate this format."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator account for Medicare eligibility rules or subsidies?",
        "answer": "This tool uses user-provided premium and out-of-pocket inputs; it does not automatically determine Medicare eligibility, premium adjustments, or subsidy eligibility. For official eligibility and premium estimates, consult the relevant government resources or a benefits advisor."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards govern data handling and accuracy?",
        "answer": "This product follows recognized guidance for engineering, security, and quality: NIST cybersecurity recommendations, ISO quality and information-security standards, IEEE numerical and software engineering practices, and organizational safety principles consistent with OSHA where applicable. Results include accuracy caveats and are not a substitute for professional advice."
