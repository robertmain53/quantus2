    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms frequency values in hertz (Hz) to gigahertz (GHz) using the standard SI prefix relationship: 1 gigahertz equals 1,000,000,000 hertz (1 GHz = 10^9 Hz). Use it for quick conversions when working with radio, RF design, digital electronics, and signal processing.",
      "Results are exact arithmetic conversions (no assumptions about instrument uncertainty). For measured data, review instrument accuracy and calibration guidance before reporting converted values; authoritative frameworks such as NIST metric-prefix guidance and ISO/IEC laboratory standards govern traceability and uncertainty."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Frequency is an SI quantity with base unit hertz (Hz), defined as inverse seconds (s⁻¹). SI prefixes scale the base unit by powers of ten; 'giga' denotes 10^9.",
      "The converter applies the fixed mathematical relationship between prefixes. No empirical models or approximations are used: the conversion is a deterministic division or multiplication by a power of ten.",
      "When converting measured frequencies, consider the instrument's specified accuracy, resolution, and calibration interval. Accredited calibration and uncertainty reporting follow ISO/IEC 17025 principles and NIST guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 GHz = 1 × 10^9 Hz.",
      "To convert Hz → GHz: divide the value in hertz by 1,000,000,000 (10^9). Example: 2,450,000,000 Hz ÷ 1,000,000,000 = 2.45 GHz.",
      "To convert GHz → Hz (reverse): multiply the value in gigahertz by 1,000,000,000 (10^9). Example: 5.0 GHz × 1,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 Hz."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000 Hz → 0.000001 GHz (1,000 ÷ 1e9 = 1e-6 GHz).",
      "2,450,000,000 Hz → 2.45 GHz (Wi‑Fi 2.4 GHz band example).",
      "0.009 GHz → 9,000,000 Hz (0.009 × 1e9 = 9e6 Hz)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter performs an exact SI-prefix conversion between hertz and gigahertz by dividing or multiplying by 10^9. For measured values, supplement converted results with instrument uncertainty and calibration traceability when precision matters."

    "glossary": [

      "Gigahertz (GHz): A frequency unit equal to 10^9 hertz. Commonly used in radio and microwave systems.",
      "Calibration: Process of comparing an instrument's measurements to a reference to establish accuracy and traceability; important when converting measured data for reporting."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between hertz and gigahertz?",
        "answer": "1 GHz = 1,000,000,000 Hz (1 × 10^9). To convert Hz to GHz, divide the Hertz value by 1,000,000,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include measurement uncertainty after converting a measured frequency?",
        "answer": "Yes. This converter performs a pure mathematical conversion. If you converted a measured value, append the instrument's uncertainty and indicate calibration status following ISO/IEC 17025 and accepted metrology practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I sometimes see results in scientific notation?",
        "answer": "Large or very small numeric results are often shown in scientific notation (e.g., 2.45e9) to preserve precision and readability. Scientific notation is a standard way to represent values across many engineering and scientific tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do instrument limits (resolution, sampling) affect frequency conversion?",
        "answer": "Conversion itself is exact, but the meaningful digits depend on the instrument's resolution and accuracy. For example, a spectrum analyzer's frequency counter may report limited digits; do not overstate precision when reporting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion valid for any frequency value?",
        "answer": "Yes—mathematically, the conversion applies to any real-valued frequency. For practical measurement and regulatory work, ensure frequencies fall within permitted bands and that measurement equipment supports the required range."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory considerations when working with GHz-range signals?",
        "answer": "Yes. Operating radio transmitters in GHz bands is subject to spectrum allocations and licensing in most jurisdictions. Consult national regulators and ITU allocations before transmitting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round converted frequencies for documentation?",
        "answer": "Round according to the measurement uncertainty and the significant digits justified by your instrument or calculation. When in doubt, include an uncertainty statement rather than excessive significant figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative guidance on SI prefixes and units?",
        "answer": "Authoritative guidance on SI units and prefixes is published by national metrology institutes and international standards organizations. Refer to NIST and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) for SI rules and prefixes."
