    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates payments and interest for auto loans when you make bi-weekly payments. It offers both a standard bi-weekly calculation (splitting the nominal annual rate across 26 periods) and an accelerated bi-weekly approximation (paying half of the equivalent monthly payment every two weeks).",
      "Use the tool to compare monthly, standard bi-weekly, and accelerated bi-weekly approaches. Results include estimated periodic payment, estimated total interest, and effective annual rate when compounding at the payment frequency. These estimates are suitable for planning and comparison but are not a substitute for a lender's contract schedule."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard annuity formulas to compute level periodic payments: Payment = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)), where r is the periodic rate and n is the number of periods. For the standard bi-weekly method we divide the entered nominal annual rate by 26 to get the periodic rate and set n = years * 26.",
      "The accelerated bi-weekly mode estimates results by halving the equivalent monthly payment and applying it on a bi-weekly cadence. This produces interest savings in practice because it increases the number of payments per year relative to monthly schedules, but the model here is an approximation and does not perform a full per-period amortization with early-payoff date shortening.",
      "Precision and numerical behavior follow widely used floating-point and financial calculation practices. For transparency we flag effective annual rate computed as (1 + periodic_rate) ^ payments_per_year - 1. Regulatory APR under consumer lending law is a legal disclosure that may differ from the effective annual rate shown here."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate (standard bi-weekly) = annual_rate_pct / 100 / 26.",
      "Number of payments = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Periodic payment (annuity) = loan_amount * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)).",
      "Effective annual rate = (1 + periodic_rate) ^ payments_per_year - 1, shown as a percentage.",
      "Accelerated bi-weekly is an approximation: periodic payment = (monthly annuity payment) / 2, applied over ~26 payments/year; amortization shortening and exact payoff dates are not simulated here."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $20,000 loan, 5% APR, 5 years. Standard bi-weekly splits the rate into 26 periods to compute the bi-weekly payment and total interest. Accelerated bi-weekly splits the monthly payment and typically reduces total interest versus monthly payments.",
      "Example 2: A borrower with $15,000, 6% APR, 4-year term and $300 fees can compare the estimated total paid under monthly, standard bi-weekly, and accelerated bi-weekly options to see potential savings before discussing exact terms with the lender."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator show the legally required APR (Regulation Z)?",
        "answer": "No. This tool shows nominal periodic payment calculations and an effective annual rate derived from periodic compounding. The legally required APR disclosed by a lender under consumer protection law may differ because it follows regulatory definitions and specific treatment of fees and finance charges. For the legally required APR see your lender's disclosure."

      {
        "question": "Is the accelerated bi-weekly result exact?",
        "answer": "No. The accelerated bi-weekly method here approximates the common practice of paying half the monthly payment every two weeks. That practice typically results in faster payoff and interest savings, but exact payoff dates and interest require a full amortization schedule with each payment applied to interest and principal."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the numbers? Should I round?",
        "answer": "Displayed values are rounded for readability. Internal calculations follow standard floating-point arithmetic consistent with IEEE 754. For contract-level precision consult your lender; small rounding differences can change the final cent amount on long schedules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I include additional fees or balloon payments?",
        "answer": "This version supports an upfront fees field. It does not model periodic extra payments, balloon payments, or irregular payment schedules. For complex scenarios use a detailed amortization tool or request an exact payoff schedule from your lender."
