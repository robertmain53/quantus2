1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion depends on a variable market exchange rate and optional service fees, so the tool requires multiple user inputs (amount, exchange rate, fees) and computes results via a formula rather than a fixed unit ratio.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), and no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata fields, no schema_org, no styling, no converter-style form omission, etc.). The only allowed form object will be the required form for simple_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
