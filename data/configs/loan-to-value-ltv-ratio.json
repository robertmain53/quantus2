    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes Loan-to-Value (LTV) as a straightforward ratio between loan amounts and property value. It shows both the primary LTV (single loan) and combined LTV (CLTV) when you include additional loans such as a second mortgage or HELOC.",
      "Use the Target LTV field to estimate the maximum primary loan you could take while remaining at or below a specified LTV after accounting for existing secondary debt. Results are approximate and intended for planning and comparison; final underwriting may apply appraisal adjustments, seasoning rules, or different definitions of value."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies direct arithmetic formulas: divide the relevant loan sum by the property value. Combined LTV adds other outstanding loans to the primary loan before dividing by value.",
      "Validation and development practices follow recognized software quality and assurance principles. Recommended governance and testing reference ISO quality management guidance and IEEE software validation recommendations. For data handling and operational security, follow NIST and ISO/IEC information security guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary LTV (%) = (Primary loan amount / Property value) × 100",
      "Combined LTV (%) = (Primary loan amount + Other loans) / Property value × 100",
      "Down payment implied = Property value − Loan(s)",
      "Max primary loan for target LTV = (Target LTV% × Property value) − Other loans"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Primary loan $200,000 on a $250,000 property → Primary LTV = (200000 / 250000) × 100 = 80%.",
      "Example 2: Same primary loan plus $20,000 HELOC → Combined LTV = ((200000 + 20000) / 250000) × 100 = 88%."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator replace lender underwriting?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides an arithmetic estimate. Lenders may apply appraised value adjustments, repair cost deductions, seasoning requirements, or different definitions for included debt. Always confirm with your lender or servicer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which loans should I include as 'other loans'?",
        "answer": "Include outstanding second mortgages, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and any junior liens that the lender considers in combined LTV calculations. Do not include consumer unsecured debt."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might my calculated LTV differ from a lender's LTV?",
        "answer": "Differences arise from appraisal methods (market value vs. purchase price), effective dates, rounding rules, and whether the lender includes certain fees or credits in the loan amount. This calculator uses raw amounts you enter without lender-specific adjustments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the result and what safeguards exist?",
        "answer": "Results are mathematically exact given your inputs but are subject to input errors, rounding, and lender policy variation. Development and validation reference IEEE and ISO practices; operational security and identity guidance reference NIST standards. This is not a substitute for professional appraisal or lender confirmation."
