    "introduction": [
      "Convert bytes to megabytes quickly and reliably. This converter uses the standard unit definitions and explains both the decimal megabyte (MB) and the binary mebibyte (MiB) so you can understand which is appropriate for storage manufacturers, operating systems, or software memory metrics.",
      "Use the decimal definition (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes) for most storage-capacity labeling and financial/spec documentation. Use the binary definition (1 MiB = 1,048,576 bytes) when working with memory, low-level OS reporting, or contexts that explicitly use binary prefixes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Two commonly used definitions exist: the SI-based decimal megabyte (MB) defined by powers of ten, and the binary mebibyte (MiB) defined by powers of two. This tool performs a unit conversion only; it does not change the underlying data.",
      "Standards bodies and government guidance distinguish the two definitions. When precision matters (billing, compliance, or specification), state which definition you used and cite the relevant standard or guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal megabytes (MB, SI): MB = bytes ÷ 1,000,000. Example: 5,000,000 bytes = 5.0 MB.",
      "Binary mebibytes (MiB, binary): MiB = bytes ÷ 1,048,576 (2^20). Example: 5,242,880 bytes = 5.0 MiB.",
      "When this converter shows “megabytes (MB)”, it uses the decimal definition unless a binary/miB option is explicitly presented. For reporting that requires binary prefixes, convert to MiB and label accordingly."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "12345678 bytes → 12.345678 MB (decimal: divide by 1,000,000)",
      "12345678 bytes → 11.7737 MiB (binary: divide by 1,048,576)",
      "1,000,000 bytes → 1.0 MB (decimal) and ≈0.9537 MiB (binary)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between MB and MiB?",
        "answer": "MB (megabyte) is the decimal unit equal to 1,000,000 bytes and follows SI prefixes. MiB (mebibyte) is the binary unit equal to 1,048,576 bytes (2^20). Use MB when following decimal storage labeling; use MiB when the binary (power-of-two) definition is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do drive capacities shown by the manufacturer differ from my operating system?",
        "answer": "Manufacturers commonly advertise capacity using decimal MB/GB (powers of 10). Operating systems often report sizes using binary units (MiB/GiB) or convert binary values into decimal-labeled units, creating apparent discrepancies. Always check which definition is used in the label or OS report."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which definition should I use for compliance, billing, or contracts?",
        "answer": "Specify the unit definition explicitly in contracts or specifications. Many standards and regulatory references recommend using SI decimal units (MB = 1,000,000 bytes) for commercial labeling; if binary units are intended, use the IEC binary prefixes (MiB, GiB) and state them clearly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I display?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context: two to three significant digits are typical for user-facing displays; for technical or QA work keep more digits. Always accompany the numeric value with the unit label (MB or MiB) so the definition is unambiguous."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there any calibration or instrument limitation to worry about when measuring bytes?",
        "answer": "Bytes are discrete counts of data, not analog measurements, so there is no instrument calibration in the traditional sense. However, reporting and measurement tools (filesystems, backup software, hardware counters) may apply rounding, compression, or sparse-file handling—document those behaviors when precision is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert stored file sizes that include compression or metadata?",
        "answer": "This converter converts raw byte counts. If filesystems apply compression, deduplication, or container metadata, the byte count you supply must reflect the specific metric you want converted (logical size vs. on-disk usage)."
