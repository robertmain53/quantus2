    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a fuel economy value expressed in miles per imperial gallon (MPG, UK/imperial) into liters consumed per mile (L/mi). The conversion uses the exact imperial gallon definition to produce a deterministic numeric result suitable for engineering, reporting, or comparison.",
      "Use the tool to compare vehicles, translate manufacturer figures, or prepare data for further calculations (for example converting to L/100 km). Review the methodology and FAQs for information on precision, differences between US and Imperial gallons, and measurement limits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The imperial gallon is defined as exactly 4.54609 liters. Miles per gallon (MPG) expresses distance traveled per unit of fuel volume; liters per mile (L/mi) expresses volume consumed per unit distance. Convert by dividing the liter volume of one imperial gallon by the MPG value.",
      "This is a fixed mathematical relationship (no empirical coefficients). For traceable reporting and auditing, apply NIST/ISO measurement best practices: use NIST-traceable flow meters or calibrated fuel measurement methods and report the number of significant figures reflecting instrument uncertainty.",
      "Accuracy caveat: this conversion provides exact arithmetic based on unit definitions. Real-world fuel consumption varies with driving conditions, measurement method, temperature, and fuel density. For regulatory or safety-critical uses, follow applicable standards for measurement equipment calibration and uncertainty reporting (see citations)."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Use the exact volume of the imperial (UK) gallon: 1 imperial gallon = 4.54609 liters.",
      "Step 2: Given MPG (UK), compute liters per mile as: L/mi = 4.54609 ÷ (MPG).",
      "Compact formula: L/mi = 4.54609 / MPG(UK). Example numeric evaluation: MPG = 50 → L/mi = 4.54609 / 50 = 0.0909218 L/mi.",
      "Optional: to convert L/mi to L/100 km multiply L/mi by 62.137119 (since 1 mile = 1.609344 km and 100 km = 62.137119 miles)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 50 MPG (UK) → L/mi = 4.54609 / 50 = 0.0909218 L/mi (rounded 0.09092 L/mi).",
      "Example 2: 30 MPG (UK) → L/mi = 4.54609 / 30 = 0.1515363 L/mi (rounded 0.15154 L/mi).",
      "Example 3: 40 MPG (UK) → L/mi = 4.54609 / 40 = 0.11365225 L/mi (rounded 0.11365 L/mi)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between UK (imperial) MPG and US MPG?",
        "answer": "Imperial (UK) and US gallons are different sizes. One imperial gallon = 4.54609 liters; one US gallon = 3.785411784 liters. This converter uses the imperial gallon. Converting US MPG requires using the US gallon volume instead of 4.54609 L."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report as many significant figures as justified by measurement uncertainty. For routine comparisons, two to three significant digits are common. For instrument-calibrated measurements used in compliance, follow the uncertainty statement from your calibration certificate and relevant ISO/NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion valid for regulatory reporting or vehicle lab tests?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact for unit translation. For regulatory or lab reporting, ensure fuel volume and distance measurements are performed and documented in accordance with applicable standards and local regulations; report measurement uncertainty and traceability to NIST/ISO where required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might the converted value differ from manufacturer specifications?",
        "answer": "Manufacturer figures are often averaged from test cycles under controlled conditions and may use different rounding rules or reporting units (for example L/100 km). Real-world driving, measurement method differences, fuel quality and temperature all affect observed consumption."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert the result to L/100 km?",
        "answer": "First compute L/mi as 4.54609 / MPG(UK). Then multiply that L/mi value by 62.137119 to get L/100 km. This multiplier is exact given mile-to-kilometer conversion 1 mi = 1.609344 km."
