1. This is a "converter" because the user wants a single-value, single-output conversion (USD → ETH); the interface is a direct currency conversion tool where a user enters one amount and expects one converted value.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no extra metadata fields, no UI/layout keys, no schema_org, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
