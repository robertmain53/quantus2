    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a power value in kilowatts (kW) to metric horsepower (often abbreviated PS), using the established fixed conversion factor between the units. It is intended for engineering, equipment specification, and quick verification tasks where a standard unit-to-unit conversion is required.",
      "The converter returns a numeric equivalent; users should consider measurement uncertainty and the context of the rating (electrical rating versus engine output) before using results for compliance, procurement, or safety reporting.",
      "When high accuracy is required for certification, testing, or regulatory submissions, use calibrated instruments and follow relevant national or international standards cited below for unit definitions and reporting precision."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally recognized relationship between the SI unit kilowatt and the metric horsepower definition. This relationship is a fixed multiplicative factor and does not depend on experimental measurements.",
      "Precision guidance and recommended rounding are provided so results can be reported consistently with engineering documentation. When converting measured power, include measurement uncertainty rather than overstating precision.",
      "References to standards bodies and measurement guidance are provided to support traceability and compliance: see NIST for unit definitions, ISO for quantities and units, and IEEE for electrical measurement practices. Follow workplace safety standards (for example OSHA) when applying power values to equipment operation or labeling."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "One metric horsepower (PS) is defined as exactly 0.73549875 kilowatts. Equivalently, 1 kilowatt equals 1.3596216173064 metric horsepower.",
      "Formula: metric horsepower = kilowatts × 1.3596216173064.",
      "Steps: 1) Take the value in kW. 2) Multiply by 1.3596216173064. 3) Apply appropriate rounding based on the required number of significant figures or stated measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 kW → 1 × 1.3596216173064 = 1.359621617 metric hp. Report as 1.36 mhp when rounding to three significant figures.",
      "Example 2: 100 kW → 100 × 1.3596216173064 = 135.96216173064 metric hp. Report as 136.0 mhp when one decimal place is required for equipment nameplates."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between metric horsepower and mechanical (imperial) horsepower?",
        "answer": "Metric horsepower (PS) is defined differently than mechanical (imperial) horsepower. The conversion factor used here is specific to metric horsepower (PS). For mechanical horsepower use the corresponding conversion factor for that horsepower definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use when reporting converted values?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context: for quick comparisons 2–3 significant figures are common; for technical specifications or test reports include measurement uncertainty and use the number of decimals justified by instrument accuracy. Avoid presenting more digits than the input measurement supports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion precise enough for certification or legal documents?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact given the defined factor. However, values derived from physical measurements include instrument uncertainty. For certification or regulatory filings, document measurement method, calibration status, and uncertainty per the relevant standard (for example ISO or IEEE guidance)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use kW instead of horsepower on equipment labels?",
        "answer": "Local regulations or industry standards may require one unit or both. Use the unit mandated by jurisdiction or standard; if both are shown, include consistent rounding and a note on measurement conditions. Refer to applicable regulatory guidance for labeling requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for losses or mechanical efficiency?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a pure unit conversion. To account for losses or efficiency, first calculate the net or gross power using the appropriate efficiency factors, then convert the resulting power value between units."
