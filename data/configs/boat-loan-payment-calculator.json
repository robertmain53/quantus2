    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates fixed-rate boat loan payments for common payment schedules including monthly and bi-weekly. Enter the loan amount, down payment, APR, term and desired payment frequency. You may add a per-period extra payment to see its effect on total interest and payoff time.",
      "Use the equivalent monthly payment output to compare how different schedules (for example bi-weekly versus monthly) change periodic cash flow and total interest. Results assume a fixed interest rate and regular on-time payments; actual lender schedules, fees, taxes or rounding rules may differ."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use the standard amortization formula for fixed-rate installment loans. The periodic interest rate is the APR divided by the chosen number of payments per year. The scheduled payment is the level payment that amortizes the financed principal over the specified number of periods.",
      "When an extra per-period payment is entered it is added directly to each scheduled payment and reduces principal faster, lowering total interest and accelerating payoff. The tool assumes payments are applied at period end and that interest compounds at the same frequency as payments.",
      "For reliability and traceability we follow recognized guidance on calculation transparency and numerical stability. See NIST and ISO guidance for numerical methods and documentation practices, and IEEE best practices for software reliability and testing. This calculator is a financial estimator and not a substitute for lender disclosures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Let P = principal - down_payment.",
      "Let r = annual_rate / 100 / payments_per_year (periodic interest rate).",
      "Let n = term_years * payments_per_year (total number of payments).",
      "Periodic payment (excluding optional extra) = r * P / (1 - (1 + r)^-n). The calculator returns this plus any extra payment entered.",
      "Total paid = periodic payment (including extra) * n. Total interest = Total paid - P."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Will switching to bi-weekly payments always save interest?",
        "answer": "Bi-weekly schedules often reduce interest because you make more frequent payments and sometimes an extra half-month equivalent per year, which reduces average principal sooner. Savings depend on how your lender applies payments and whether the APR and compounding align with payment frequency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include fees, taxes or insurance?",
        "answer": "No. This tool models interest and principal only. It does not include lender fees, sales tax, registration, insurance, or optional products. Add those costs separately when comparing offers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Results are mathematical estimates based on the provided inputs and the fixed-rate amortization model. Actual payoff schedules may differ due to rounding, lender posting rules, fees, payment timing, or variable rates. See the accuracy caveat in the citations for guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I provide to my lender to verify these numbers?",
        "answer": "Provide your loan amount, APR, term, payment frequency and any intended extra payments. Compare this estimator to the lender's amortization schedule and disclosures; lenders are required to provide a Truth-in-Lending or equivalent disclosure showing APR and payment schedule."
