    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a value in megabits per second (commonly written Mb/s or Mbps) into bits per second (b/s or bps). In telecommunications and consumer networking, megabit is typically used as an SI decimal prefix (1 megabit = 1,000,000 bits).",
      "Because computing communities sometimes use binary-prefixed units (mebibit, written Mib), this tool shows the standard decimal conversion by default and documents the binary alternative for cases where 1 Mib = 2^20 bits (1,048,576 bits) is required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary conversion follows SI (decimal) prefixes: multiply megabits by 1,000,000 to obtain bits per second. This matches telecom practice and SI guidance from international measurement authorities.",
      "When binary prefixes are required (for example in some low-level computing contexts), use the mebibit interpretation: multiply by 1,048,576 (2^20). The converter’s default uses the decimal definition; the alternative is documented for transparency.",
      "Practical note: measured throughput on real networks may differ from nominal link rates due to protocol overhead, error retransmission, and measurement tool resolution. For regulated measurement or calibration, follow guidance from NIST and relevant telecommunications measurement programs."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) conversion — standard telecom usage: bits per second = megabits per second × 1,000,000",
      "Binary (IEC) conversion — mebibit interpretation: bits per second = mebibits per second × 1,048,576 (2^20)",
      "Example formula notation: bps = Mbps × 10^6 (decimal) or bps = Mib/s × 2^20 (binary/mebibit)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 Mbps → 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 bps",
      "100 Mbps → 100 × 1,000,000 = 100,000,000 bps",
      "0.5 Mbps → 0.5 × 1,000,000 = 500,000 bps",
      "1 Mib/s (mebibit) → 1 × 1,048,576 = 1,048,576 bps (binary interpretation)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Mb and MB?",
        "answer": "Mb (lowercase b) denotes bits; MB (uppercase B) denotes bytes. 1 byte = 8 bits. Network speeds are usually expressed in bits per second (e.g., Mbps)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which conversion should I use for network speeds?",
        "answer": "Use the decimal (SI) conversion (1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits per second) for telecommunications and internet service specifications. Use the binary (mebibit) conversion only when software or low-level data tools explicitly use binary prefixes (Mib)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do reported Mbps values equal actual data throughput?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. Protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgements), encryption, and retransmissions reduce usable throughput. For calibrated measurements, follow laboratory procedures and measurement uncertainty guidance from standards bodies."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact for the chosen definition (decimal or binary). Practical measurement precision depends on the instrument, sampling method, and measurement interval; consult NIST guidance on measurement uncertainty for formal lab use."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do binary prefixes like 'mebibit' come from?",
        "answer": "Binary prefixes (kibi-, mebi-, gibi-) were standardized by international bodies to remove ambiguity between powers of ten and powers of two. The IEC/BIPM publications document these prefixes and their intended use."
