      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms megabit speeds to raw bits per second for detailed technical analysis.",
        "Network engineers often need to express Mbps speeds in bits to understand component-level performance.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 1 megabit per second equals exactly 1 million bits per second."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps. To convert Mbps to bps, multiply by 1,000,000.",
        "Expressing speeds in bps reveals the fundamental data transfer rate.",
        "Understanding Mbps to bps conversion is essential for network engineering analysis.",
        "This converter provides precise data rate conversion for technical calculations."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Standard broadband: 100 Mbps = 100,000,000 bps.",
        "Example 2 – Fast connection: 500 Mbps = 500,000,000 bps.",
        "Example 3 – Gigabit Ethernet: 1,000 Mbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 1 Gbps."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "Why express speeds in bps instead of Mbps?",
          "answer": "Base unit. Useful for precise engineering calculations and component specifications."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do Mbps relate to MB/s?",
          "answer": "Mbps = megabits per second. MB/s = megabytes per second. 8 Mbps = 1 MB/s."
        },
        {
          "question": "What determines maximum network speed?",
          "answer": "Slowest component: router, modem, ISP service tier, cable quality, distance, interference."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can two devices achieve max speed simultaneously?",
          "answer": "Not if combined needs exceed available bandwidth. Bandwidth is shared among all devices."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long to download a file?",
          "answer": "Time (seconds) = File Size (bits) ÷ Speed (bps). Example: 80 Mb file ÷ 10 Mbps = 8 seconds."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the relationship with ping?",
          "answer": "Speed (bps) and latency (ms) are different. High speed + high latency = slow responsiveness."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need faster than 1 Gbps?",
          "answer": "For most uses: no. 1 Gbps sufficient for 4K video, large file transfers, multiple concurrent uses."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Wi-Fi as fast as wired?",
          "answer": "Wi-Fi maximum same as wired, but actual performance usually 50-70% of wired due to interference."
