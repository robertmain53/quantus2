      "This calculator produces a research-grounded estimate for roof replacement or re-cover projects. It adjusts horizontal footprint area for slope, applies a material waste factor, and separates material and labor costs so you can compare quotes accurately.",
      "Results are estimates intended for planning and budgeting. They use standard geometric adjustments and industry practice for waste and labor; for final pricing, obtain on-site measurements and written quotes from licensed contractors."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We compute the sloped roof area from the horizontal footprint using the Pythagorean correction: roof plane area = footprint area × sqrt(1 + (rise/12)^2).",
      "A configurable waste percentage increases the material area to account for cuts, ridges, and off-cuts; this is industry standard and varies by material and complexity.",
      "Material and labor totals are calculated per square foot of adjusted area and may be scaled with a regional multiplier to reflect local market differences.",
      "The calculator purposely separates fixed costs (permits, debris removal, minor structural repairs) so they are visible and editable.",
      "Formulas and guidance follow common building-science measurement practices and safety guidance; always confirm with local building departments and licensed roofers."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "roof_plane_area = roof_area_sqft × sqrt(1 + (roof_slope / 12)^2)",
      "adjusted_area = roof_plane_area × (1 + waste_percent / 100)",
      "roofing_squares = adjusted_area / 100",
      "material_cost = adjusted_area × material_cost_per_sqft × region_multiplier",
      "labor_cost = adjusted_area × labor_cost_per_sqft × region_multiplier",

    "examples": [
      "Example: 2,000 sq ft footprint, 4/12 slope, 10% waste, $3.50/ft² material, $3.00/ft² labor, $750 other costs → calculator returns adjusted area, squares, material, labor and total cost estimates for budgeting.",
      "Use the region multiplier to account for high-cost metropolitan areas (e.g., 1.2–1.5) or low-cost rural markets (e.g., 0.8–0.95)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this estimate?",
        "answer": "This tool provides planning-level estimates. Accuracy depends on input quality—particularly actual measured area, chosen waste percentage, and local labor rates. Typical variance vs. final contractor bids is ±10–30% depending on project complexity. For a binding price, get written site-specific estimates from licensed contractors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does slope (rise per 12) change the area?",
        "answer": "A sloped roof has greater surface area than its horizontal footprint. We apply a geometric correction derived from the Pythagorean theorem to convert horizontal projection to sloped plane area."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I enter for material waste percentage?",
        "answer": "Common practice: 5–10% for simple installs, 10–20% for complex layouts or steep roofs, and higher when valleys, hips, or multiple pitches increase cuts. Use contractor guidance for material-specific recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I pick labor and material unit costs?",
        "answer": "Use recent contractor quotes or local supplier prices when possible. National and regional averages are useful starting points, but labor and materials vary widely by location, roof complexity, and material type."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need permits or inspections?",
        "answer": "Many jurisdictions require permits and inspections for roof replacement. Check your local building department before work begins. Permits, disposal fees and code-required repairs should be included in Other fixed costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or environmental rules I should follow?",
        "answer": "Yes. For worker safety, follow federal and state worker-safety guidance. For renovation affecting lead paint or hazardous materials, follow renovation rules and disposal regulations. Always verify contractor compliance before hiring."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this calculator handle multi-layer re-roofs?",
        "answer": "This calculator assumes a single replacement layer. Multi-layer removals add labor, disposal, and potentially structural repairs. Increase Other fixed costs and labor/unit costs to model tear-off scenarios, and confirm with a contractor."
