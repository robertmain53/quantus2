KB = kilobytes (storage). 8 kb = 1 KB."},{"question":"Why the confusion?","answer":"Similar abbreviations. 'b' vs 'B' matters. Always check context."},{"question":"How long to transfer 1 KB?","answer":"At 1 kbps: 8 seconds. At 56 kbps: 0.14 seconds. Very fast."},{"question":"Are kilobytes still used?","answer":"Rarely. Modern files measured in MB/GB. Kilobytes only for tiny files."},{"question":"What fits in 1 kilobyte?","answer":"~200 words of text.
