    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a single pressure value from kilopascals (kPa) to megapascals (MPa) using the exact SI relationship: 1 kPa = 0.001 MPa. It is intended for quick unit conversion for engineering, lab records, documentation, and calculations that use SI pressure units.",
      "Use the tool when you need a reliable numeric conversion between these two SI units. For measurement-critical work, confirm that your pressure instrument is calibrated and that the conversion precision aligns with measurement uncertainty and regulatory requirements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed SI scale factor between the two units: 1 kilopascal equals 0.001 megapascals. No temperature, material, or additional physical properties affect the unit conversion because both units measure the same physical dimension (pressure).",
      "Recommendations for high-trust results: keep track of instrument calibration certificates (traceable to national standards), round results according to significant-figure rules appropriate for your measurement uncertainty, and document any conversion in reports to comply with audit or regulatory traceability."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply the value in kilopascals by 0.001 to get megapascals.",
      "Formula: MPa = kPa × 0.001",
      "Example calculation step: 101.325 kPa × 0.001 = 0.101325 MPa"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 kPa → 1.0 MPa",
      "250 kPa → 0.25 MPa",
      "101.325 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure) → 0.101325 MPa"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is any temperature or gas type needed for this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. This is a pure units conversion between two SI pressure units. Temperature, gas composition, and other physical conditions do not change the mathematical relationship between kPa and MPa."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep?",
        "answer": "Keep significant figures consistent with your measurement uncertainty and instrument specification. For display, use the same number of significant digits as the input or round according to the uncertainty interval; avoid presenting more precision than your measurement supports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter account for instrument calibration or traceability?",
        "answer": "No. The converter performs only the unit conversion. For calibrated measurements and regulatory compliance, ensure instruments are calibrated to national standards and retain calibration records as required by your procedures or applicable regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What level of accuracy can I expect from this mathematical conversion?",
        "answer": "The numerical relationship is exact (1 kPa = 0.001 MPa). Any loss of accuracy arises from numeric rounding in displays or from the precision of the input value. When reporting, include measurement uncertainty separately."
