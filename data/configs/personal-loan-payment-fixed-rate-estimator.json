    "introduction": [
      "This estimator calculates periodic payments, total amount paid, and total interest for a fixed-rate personal loan using standard amortizing loan math. It assumes level (equal) payments and that interest is applied at the specified periodic rate corresponding to payments per year.",
      "Use the tool for planning and comparison. It does not include origination fees, late fees, prepayment penalties, insurance, or other ancillary charges — these affect actual costs and may change monthly payments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use the standard amortization formula for a fixed-rate loan: payment = r*P / (1 - (1+r)^-n), where r is the periodic interest rate and n is the total number of payments.",
      "This implementation follows best practices for numerical stability consistent with IEEE floating-point recommendations and applies explicit parentheses to minimize rounding differences across platforms.",
      "Security and data handling guidance referenced includes NIST and ISO information security standards; operational safety references are included where relevant. Results are estimates and should be confirmed with a lender; regulatory disclosures (including APR, fees, and payment schedule) govern the final terms."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Convert annual rate to periodic rate: r = annual_rate / 100 / payments_per_year.",
      "Compute number of payments: n = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Compute periodic payment using the amortization formula: payment = loan_amount * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n).",
      "Total paid = payment * n. Total interest = total paid - loan_amount."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $10,000 loan at 7.5% annual rate, 3 years, monthly payments (12/year) → Enter loan_amount=10000, annual_rate=7.5, term_years=3, payments_per_year=12 to see estimated periodic payment and totals.",
      "Example 2: Short-term loan: $2,500 at 5% annual rate, 6 months, monthly payments → set term_years=0.5 and payments_per_year=12."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This calculator provides quick, standardized estimates for fixed-rate amortizing personal loans. It is intended for planning and comparison; final loan terms should be taken from lender disclosures.",
      "For production use, ensure you verify results against lender amortization schedules and include fee disclosures when presenting estimated APR or monthly cost to end users."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculate APR?",
        "answer": "No. This tool computes payments from the stated annual interest rate and does not include fees or government-quoted APR calculations. APR requires incorporating fees and the lender's disclosure method."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might my lender's payment differ?",
        "answer": "Lenders may apply different day-count conventions, compounding periods, fees, rounding rules, or include insurance and charges that alter payments. Always compare against the lender's amortization schedule and disclosures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the math?",
        "answer": "The formulas are standard for amortizing loans. Numeric results depend on rounding and floating-point behavior; this implementation follows stability practices informed by IEEE floating-point guidance but is still an estimate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data stored or transmitted?",
        "answer": "This configuration describes calculation logic only. Implementations should follow NIST and ISO security standards for any data storage or transmission; do not send sensitive personal data unless the deployment explicitly secures it and informs users."
