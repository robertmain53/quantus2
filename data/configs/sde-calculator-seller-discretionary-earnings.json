    "introduction": [
      "Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) is a commonly used cash-flow proxy for small owner-operated businesses. It starts from reported profit and adds back owner-specific compensation, nonrecurring items, and financing or tax effects that are not required by a new owner.",
      "This calculator offers three workflows: a standard SDE built from net income, a reconciliation-first workflow for careful add-backs, and an alternate path starting from EBIT. Use the workflow that matches your accounts and reconciling documentation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formula: SDE = Net income + Owner compensation + Owner benefits + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation & amortization + One-time expenses + Owner rent (if applicable) + Other approved add-backs − Non-operating income.",
      "Reconciled workflows separate non-operating and one-time items first, then add owner-specific costs to reduce double-counting and improve comparability across buyers.",
      "Security, data handling, and reporting recommendations follow controls and documentation best practices cited by leading standards bodies to support traceability and auditability of inputs."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Choose the input workflow that matches your financial statements (Net Income, Reconciled Add-backs, or EBIT).",
      "Step 2: Enter reported figures in the input fields. Provide supporting notes for any nonrecurring or owner-specific items used as add-backs.",
      "Step 3: Review outputs: SDE value and SDE margin. If total revenue is zero or not provided, margin will be zero or not meaningful; rely on SDE absolute value instead.",
      "Step 4: Keep a reconciliation memo and source documents; buyers and professional valuers typically require supporting schedules for add-backs."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is SDE the same as EBITDA?",
        "answer": "No. EBITDA excludes owner compensation and some owner-specific add-backs. SDE is intended for small owner-operated businesses and typically adds back owner salary and benefits to estimate cash available to an owner-operator."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which inputs need documentation?",
        "answer": "Nonrecurring expenses, owner personal expenses paid by the business, and unusual adjustments require source documents such as invoices, contracts, or written explanations to be credible to buyers or advisors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
        "answer": "This tool provides an estimation framework. Accuracy depends on the quality of inputs and the completeness of reconciliations. Use this for preliminary analysis and engage a qualified accountant or valuation professional for transaction-level valuation. See accuracy and compliance notes below."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use tax-deductible items as add-backs?",
        "answer": "Only when they are owner-specific or non-operating in nature. Items required for ongoing operations should not be added back. Consult a tax professional for tax treatment implications."
