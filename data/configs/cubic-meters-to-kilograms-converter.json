    "introduction": [
      "Convert a material volume in cubic metres (m³) to mass in kilograms (kg) by supplying the material density in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³). This is used across engineering, shipping, lab work, and material costing where mass must be derived from measured or tabulated volume.",
      "Density is material- and condition-dependent. When available, use measured density at the relevant temperature and pressure. For many calculations, water at 4 °C is taken as approximately 1000 kg/m³, but density varies with temperature and composition."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Mass is calculated by multiplying volume by density. Both inputs must use coherent SI units: volume in m³ and density in kg/m³. This ensures the product has units of kg.",
      "Prefer measured densities from calibrated instruments (hydrostatic balance, pycnometer) or authoritative references. For safety-critical or regulatory work, follow measurement and calibration practices recommended by standards organizations and national metrology institutes.",
      "Report results with appropriate significant figures based on the input data and instrument uncertainty. Document the temperature and pressure at which density was defined when precision matters."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Ensure volume is in cubic metres (m³). Convert if necessary (1 L = 0.001 m³).",
      "Step 2: Ensure density is in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³). Many tables list density in g/cm³; multiply g/cm³ by 1000 to get kg/m³.",
      "Formula: mass (kg) = density (kg/m³) × volume (m³).",
      "Example: For water at ~4 °C, density ≈ 1000 kg/m³. A volume of 1.5 m³ → mass = 1000 × 1.5 = 1500 kg."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Volume = 1 m³, Density = 1000 kg/m³ → Mass = 1 × 1000 = 1000 kg (typical freshwater near 4 °C).",
      "Example 2: Volume = 0.25 m³, Density = 7850 kg/m³ (steel) → Mass = 0.25 × 7850 = 1962.5 kg.",
      "Example 3: Volume = 0.01 m³, Density = 0.92 × 1000 = 920 kg/m³ (approx. light crude oil) → Mass = 0.01 × 920 = 9.2 kg."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What density should I use if I don't know the material?",
        "answer": "Use a published reference table or manufacturer specification for the material. If exact composition is unknown, obtain a sample and measure density under controlled temperature using a calibrated instrument. For general estimates, use typical densities from engineering handbooks but flag uncertainty for decisions that affect safety or compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does temperature affect the conversion?",
        "answer": "Density changes with temperature (and to a lesser extent with pressure). For liquids and gases, density typically decreases as temperature rises. Report the temperature at which density was specified. For high-precision work, apply thermal expansion corrections or use density values tabulated at the relevant temperature."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate will the calculated mass be?",
        "answer": "Accuracy depends on the precision and uncertainty of the volume measurement and the density value. Combine measurement uncertainties according to standard uncertainty propagation rules. For formal measurement guidance, follow national metrology institute and ISO practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert liters to kilograms with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert liters to cubic metres first (1 L = 0.001 m³) then multiply by density in kg/m³. Alternatively, enter the equivalent volume in m³ directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory implications for transport or hazardous materials?",
        "answer": "Yes. Mass-based regulatory thresholds (for transport limits, classification, or reporting) may apply. Use validated densities and follow regulations from the relevant authority for hazard classification, labeling, and transport documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle solids with internal porosity or voids?",
        "answer": "Decide whether you need bulk density (includes porosity and voids) or material particle density (excludes pore space). Use the density type that matches your application and be explicit in reporting which was used."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report significant figures consistent with the least precise input and instrument uncertainty. Do not imply greater accuracy than supported by measurement or reference data."
