    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms length measurements from Meters to Yards, enabling understanding of imperial specifications.",
      "Metric measurements often need conversion to yards for US sports and construction contexts.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 yard equals exactly 0.9144 meters."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 yard = 0.9144 meters. To convert meters to yards, divide by 0.9144. For example, 1 m ≈ 1.09 yards, 10 m ≈ 10.9 yards.",
      "Sports rules and field dimensions in the US are specified in yards, requiring metric conversion for international events.",
      "Construction specifications from international sources use meters but need conversion for US implementation.",
      "This converter provides precise length conversions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Golf distance: A 100-meter par 3 is approximately 109.4 yards.",
      "Example 2 – Sports field: A 90-meter field is approximately 98.4 yards long.",
      "Example 3 – Measurement: A 50-meter distance is approximately 54.7 yards."

      {
        "question": "How many feet in a meter?",

      {
        "question": "What is a meter used for?",
        "answer": "Meters measure distances and dimensions in all scientific and most international contexts."
