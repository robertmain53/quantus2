    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length value from metres (m) to yards (yd). The conversion uses the internationally agreed relationship between the metre and the yard and is appropriate for everyday and engineering use.",
      "The conversion factor is based on an exact definition adopted by international agreement: one yard is exactly 0.9144 metres. For routine calculations the result can be rounded to the required number of decimal places; for traceable metrology or surveying use the guidance and standards cited below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the fixed, exact relationship between the international yard and the metre established by international agreement: 1 yard = 0.9144 metres. Converting metres to yards therefore uses the reciprocal of 0.9144.",
      "No empirical measurement or approximation is required to perform the mathematical conversion itself. However, practical measurement of a length in metres carries instrument uncertainty and calibration requirements that affect the meaningful precision of the converted value.",
      "For high-precision or regulatory work (surveying, legal measurements, laboratory calibration) follow standards and local regulations; in some contexts the US survey foot/yard historically differs from the international yard and may be required instead."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Exact relationship: 1 yard = 0.9144 metres (international yard).",
      "To convert metres to yards: yards = metres ÷ 0.9144.",
      "Equivalent multiplication form using the reciprocal: yards = metres × 1.0936132983377078 (rounded representation of 1 / 0.9144)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Convert 5 metres to yards. Using yards = metres ÷ 0.9144 gives 5 ÷ 0.9144 = 5.468066491688539. Rounded to two decimals = 5.47 yd.",
      "Example 2: Convert 0 metres. 0 ÷ 0.9144 = 0.0 yd."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The defining relationship 1 yd = 0.9144 m is exact by international agreement. The numeric reciprocal (1 / 0.9144) is an exact rational value but its decimal representation is finite only to a chosen number of digits; numerical results are typically rounded for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I worry about differences like the US survey yard?",
        "answer": "For most applications the international yard (1 yd = 0.9144 m) is the correct standard. In legacy surveying and some cadastral work the US survey foot/yard has been used; if you are performing legal surveying or working with historical data, confirm which unit definition is required by the governing authority or standards body."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on the measurement uncertainty and application. For casual use 2 decimal places are common. For engineering use, match the significant figures to instrument calibration and measurement uncertainty; do not display more precision than your input measurement justifies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does instrument calibration affect the converted result?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical conversion is exact, but the meaningful accuracy of a converted length depends on how accurately the original metre value was measured. Instruments should be calibrated to traceable standards and measurement uncertainty should be carried through conversions for reporting."
