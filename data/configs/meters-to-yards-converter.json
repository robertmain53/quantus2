    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a length in meters (m) to yards (yd) using the internationally agreed exact relationship between the units. The international yard is defined as exactly 0.9144 meters, which makes the mathematical conversion deterministic and suitable for technical, commercial, and educational use.",
      "Use this tool for quick, repeatable conversions. For engineering, calibration, or regulatory compliance work, follow the accuracy and traceability guidance in the methodology and citations below to ensure measurement integrity."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the international definition: 1 yard = 0.9144 meters exactly. This definition is maintained by national metrology institutes and referenced in international standards.",
      "Displayed results are the product of a fixed mathematical transformation. For applications requiring documented traceability or legal metrology, calibrate measuring instruments against accredited standards and retain calibration records according to applicable policies such as those from national metrology bodies and ISO guidelines."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: yards = meters ÷ 0.9144",
      "Alternate formula: yards = meters × 1.0936132983377078 (reciprocal of 0.9144).",
      "Rounding guidance: choose significant digits appropriate to the use case. For everyday use 2–3 decimal places are common; for engineering or surveying follow project or standard-specific precision requirements."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between meters and yards?",
        "answer": "By international agreement, 1 yard is exactly 0.9144 meters. Use yards = meters ÷ 0.9144 for exact conversion. The reciprocal is approximately 1.0936132983 yards per meter."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "It depends on context. For casual conversions 2 decimal places are usually sufficient. For engineering, surveying, or regulatory reports follow the precision specified by the governing standard or project specification, and document rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for legal or regulated measurements?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact, but legal or regulated measurements require instrument calibration, traceability to national standards, and adherence to the relevant regulations and documentation practices. Consult applicable regulatory guidance before relying on measurements for compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits or safety concerns when converting large values?",
        "answer": "Mathematically there are no inherent limits, but when working with very large or very small numbers consider numeric precision and storage format in software. For physical measurements, consider instrument range, environmental factors, and safety rules governed by workplace standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document a conversion in a technical report?",
        "answer": "State the input value and units, show the conversion formula used (with the exact factor 0.9144), report the converted value with the number of significant digits or decimal places and rounding rule, and, where required, include instrument calibration and traceability information."
