1. This is a **advanced_calc** because EBIT can be derived via multiple valid input sets (for example: revenue minus operating expenses; or net income plus interest and taxes), so the tool should offer selectable methods with conditional inputs and dependent variables.

2. I will use `component_type: 'advanced_calc'` with `logic.type: 'advanced'`.

3. I will structure `page_content` as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like `[url](url)`, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, calculator, form for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
