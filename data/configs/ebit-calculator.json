    "introduction": [
      "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) measures operating profitability before financing and tax impacts. It is widely used for margin analysis, operating performance comparisons across companies, and as an input to valuation multiples such as EV/EBIT.",
      "This tool computes EBIT from income statement line items and provides a reconciliation computed from Net Income (Net Income + Interest Expense + Income Tax Expense). Use the reconciliation check to identify classification differences or non-operating items that affect reported EBIT."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary calculation: EBIT = Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold − Operating Expenses − Depreciation & Amortization + Other Operating Income. This follows standard presentation where depreciation and amortization are operating expenses and other operating items are included in operating profit.",
      "Reconciled calculation: EBIT (reconciled) = Net Income + Interest Expense + Income Tax Expense. This is a back-solve from the bottom of the P&L; differences between the two approaches highlight non-operating gains/losses, unusual items, or presentation differences.",
      "EBIT Margin = EBIT / Revenue × 100. When revenue is zero, interpret margin with care; negative margins indicate operating losses. For authoritative accounting guidance, consult the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and public filing practices described by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 (direct): Revenue 1,000, COGS 400, Operating Expenses 300, D&A 50, Other Operating Income 0 → EBIT = 1,000 − 400 − 300 − 50 = 250; EBIT Margin = 25.0%.",
      "Example 2 (reconcile): Net Income 140, Interest Expense 30, Income Tax Expense 80 → Reconciled EBIT = 140 + 30 + 80 = 250; if calculated EBIT is different, investigate non-operating items or tax/interest presentation differences."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which line items should I include to compute EBIT?",
        "answer": "Include revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, depreciation & amortization, and other operating income or expense. Exclude financing items (interest) and income taxes. Treatment of one-off and non-operating items varies by disclosure; when in doubt, align with the company’s reported operating income in its financial statements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the EBIT from the income statement differ from the reconciled EBIT from Net Income?",
        "answer": "Differences can arise from non-operating gains or losses, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, tax adjustments, interest capitalizations, or presentation choices. Use the reconciliation difference to identify these items and review footnotes in filings."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I interpret a negative EBIT or EBIT margin?",
        "answer": "Negative EBIT indicates operating loss before financing and taxes. Persistent negative margins suggest structural profitability issues. Short-term negative EBIT may result from large one-off charges; review notes and normalized (adjusted) EBIT if performing comparative analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or accounting standards I should consider?",
        "answer": "Yes. For authoritative accounting classification and disclosures consult FASB (U.S. GAAP) and the SEC’s guidance on financial statement presentation and filings. International reporting follows IFRS under the IFRS Foundation. Use company filings (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q) for the firm-specific presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are these calculations and how should I round results?",
        "answer": "Calculations use the numeric inputs you provide. For reporting, round to the nearest whole unit or as customary for financial statements (thousands or millions). When comparing companies, ensure consistent currency units and rounding conventions."
