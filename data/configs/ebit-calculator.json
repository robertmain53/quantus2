1. This is an advanced_calc because users commonly compute EBIT in several valid ways (e.g., from operating income, from net income + interest + taxes, or by aggregating revenue minus COGS and operating expenses). The tool should let users pick the method that matches the data they have.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata fields, no UI/layout keys, no form for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
