    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) from primary income statement items. EBIT isolates operating performance by excluding financing (interest) and tax effects, supporting peer comparisons and operating-margin analysis.",
      "Enter amounts in the same reporting currency and period (e.g., quarterly or annual). The tool also displays EBITDA (EBIT plus depreciation and amortization) for continuity with common coverage metrics used by analysts and regulators."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Formula used: EBIT = Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses − Depreciation & Amortization + Other Operating Income (net). EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation & Amortization (equivalently Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses + Other Operating Income).",
      "Map each input to the corresponding line on the income statement: Revenue (sales/top line), COGS (direct production costs), Operating Expenses (selling, general & administrative, research and development), Depreciation & Amortization (non-cash charges), and Other Operating Income (net) for operating gains or losses.",
      "This calculator follows common practice used in financial reporting and analysis. For regulatory and standard-setting guidance consult authoritative resources such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). For academic context and examples, reference MIT OpenCourseWare materials on financial statements."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is EBIT and why use it?",
        "answer": "EBIT measures operating profit before interest and taxes, showing how well a company generates profits from core operations independent of capital structure and tax effects. It is useful for operational comparisons across firms and industries."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is EBIT different from EBITDA?",
        "answer": "EBIT excludes interest and taxes but includes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA removes depreciation and amortization as well, approximating cash operating performance but omitting capital intensity and non-cash charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which line items should I include from a financial statement?",
        "answer": "Use top-line Revenue (net sales), subtract COGS, and subtract operating expenses such as SG&A and R&D. Subtract recorded depreciation and amortization; add or subtract any other operating income or losses. Do not include interest expense or income tax expense."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can inputs be negative (loss items) or zeros?",
        "answer": "Yes. Revenues, expenses, and other operating items may be negative depending on reporting. The calculator accepts negative values where appropriate; ensure all inputs use the same reporting period and currency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to adjust for one-time items or discontinued operations?",
        "answer": "For comparability, remove or separately note material one-time items, restructuring costs, or discontinued operations if you want a normalized operating view. Use the notes to financial statements and management discussion for proper classification."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I interpret a negative EBIT?",
        "answer": "A negative EBIT indicates operating losses — the company’s operations did not cover operating costs and non-cash charges. Analysts will investigate margins, cost structure, and whether losses are structural or temporary."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I convert currencies or adjust for inflation before comparing firms?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert all inputs to a common reporting currency using the same exchange rates and adjust for inflation when comparing periods if inflation materially affects comparability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory standards for calculating EBIT?",
        "answer": "Regulators do not prescribe a single EBIT definition, but standard setters (FASB) and disclosures in SEC filings require transparent presentation. Always reconcile calculator inputs to the company’s reported lines and footnotes."
