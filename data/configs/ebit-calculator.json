    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) using two common approaches: (1) by aggregating income-statement components and (2) by starting from net income and adding back interest and taxes. It also provides an EBITDA companion figure for operational comparability.",
      "EBIT is widely used to compare operating profitability before financing and tax effects. Use the components method when you have detailed line items; use the net-income method when you only have the bottom-line profit and the interest and tax amounts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Method 1 — Components: EBIT = Revenue − COGS − Operating expenses − Depreciation & amortization + Other operating income. This mirrors line-item aggregation on a standard income statement and is recommended when you can separate operating versus non-operating items.",
      "Method 2 — Net-income addbacks: EBIT = Net income + Interest expense + Income tax expense. This is useful when working from reported net income in financial statements or filings.",
      "EBITDA is provided as a companion metric: EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation & amortization, which here simplifies to Revenue − COGS − Operating expenses + Other operating income when D&A is captured separately.",
      "Practical notes: exclude non-operating gains or losses (investment gains, one-time disposal gains) unless you want an adjusted operating measure. Consistency across periods and peers is key when using EBIT for trend analysis or valuation multiples."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which method should I use — components or net-income addbacks?",
        "answer": "Use the components method when you have detailed income-statement line items (it gives the clearest operating view). Use the net-income addback method when you only have net income plus explicit interest and tax amounts. Both methods should match for correctly classified financial statements; differences often indicate classification issues or non-operating items."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include non-recurring items or one-time gains/losses?",
        "answer": "By default, EBIT reflects recurring operating performance. Exclude one-time non-operating gains or losses if you need a normalized operating measure. If you include them, document the adjustment so comparisons remain transparent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can EBIT be negative and is that meaningful?",
        "answer": "Yes. Negative EBIT indicates an operating loss before financing and tax costs. It is meaningful and common for early-stage companies or firms undergoing restructuring. Investigate whether losses are from operating activity, high depreciation, or extraordinary items."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my EBITDA differ from EBIT plus D&A?",
        "answer": "It should not differ if the D&A entered is the same D&A used in the income-statement aggregation. Differences typically arise from inconsistent classification of D&A (operating vs non-operating) or omitted items such as non-cash impairment expense."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are these calculations and what are the limitations?",
        "answer": "Calculations here are arithmetic based on inputs you provide. Accuracy depends on the correctness and classification of your inputs. This tool does not access financial statements or automatic adjustments; use audited financials and note accounting policy differences when comparing companies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative guidance on income-statement presentation and terminology?",
        "answer": "Refer to official accounting standards and filing guidance for authoritative definitions and presentation requirements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provide formal guidance on classification, and university course materials explain practical application and examples."
