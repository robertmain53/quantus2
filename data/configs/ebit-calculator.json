1. This is an "advanced_calc" because EBIT can be computed with multiple valid methods (a revenue/expense breakdown or by backing up from net income) and the tool should support switching between those calculation flows and their dependent variables.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced" to represent multiple calculation methods and clear variable dependencies.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, open_graph, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or arbitrary UI fields). The form will be used only as permitted by the schema; no form will be added where not allowed.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
