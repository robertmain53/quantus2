            "answer": "By definition, 1 lux equals 1 lumen per square metre (1 lx = 1 lm/m²). To find lumens you multiply illuminance in lux by the illuminated area in m². For example, 400 lx on 5 m² corresponds to 2000 lm."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why do standards and regulations talk about lux instead of lumens?",
            "answer": "Illuminance in lux describes the light that actually reaches the working plane where people read, assemble, inspect or walk. That is what safety and building standards care about. Lumens measure the light emitted by a source; the same lumens can result in very different lux levels depending on area, distance, optics and reflectances."
          },
          {
            "question": "How accurate is a lux to lumens conversion?",
            "answer": "Mathematically the formula is exact. In practice, accuracy is limited by your lux meter calibration, how uniformly the area is lit, and how precisely you know the illuminated area. For design work, engineers typically apply utilization and maintenance factors and then confirm the design with on-site measurements."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I use this converter for photography and video lighting?",
            "answer": "Yes. Many photographers and videographers use lux readings on their set to estimate how many lumens they are getting from panels and softboxes, and to compare fixtures from different manufacturers. Remember that camera exposure also depends on shutter speed, aperture and ISO, so always test with your own camera after using the converter."
          },
          {
            "question": "Does the converter account for beam angle or distance from the light source?",
            "answer": "No. Beam angle, distance and optical losses are all folded into the lux value you measure with your meter. The converter simply turns that illuminance and your stated area into lumens. To predict lux before installation, use lighting-design software or manufacturer photometry data in addition to this tool."
