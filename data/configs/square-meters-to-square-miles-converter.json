    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms area measured in square meters (m²) to square miles (mi²) using the exact international definition of the mile (1 international mile = 1,609.344 meters). The conversion is deterministic and suitable for scientific, engineering, mapping, and general-purpose use.",
      "Use this tool for single-value conversions where you need a precise, reproducible result. For large-area land surveys, mapping, or regulatory reporting, combine this conversion with appropriate geodetic projections, measurement uncertainty, and calibration records."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally accepted definition of the mile (1 mi = 1,609.344 m) and squares that factor to convert areas. Because the underlying linear relationship is exact by international agreement, the area conversion factor is exact and not empirical.",
      "Practical considerations: when converting measured areas (for example, survey polygons captured by GPS or lidar), account for measurement uncertainty, projection distortion, and instrument calibration. For geodetic and cadastral work consult national agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Geodetic Survey for guidance on datum and projections.",
      "Rounding and display: this converter returns a numeric conversion; choose a display precision appropriate to your use case (for engineering or regulatory reporting, follow the precision rules in your domain or referencing standards)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — base linear definition: 1 international mile = 1,609.344 meters (exact).",
      "Step 2 — square the linear factor to get area factor: 1 square mile = (1,609.344 m)² = 2,589,988.110336 m² (exact).",
      "Step 3 — convert square meters to square miles: divide the area in square meters by 2,589,988.110336. Example formula: area_mi2 = area_m2 / 2,589,988.110336."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 m² → 1000 / 2,589,988.110336 = 0.000386102158542 mi² (approx. 3.8610e-4 mi²).",
      "1,000,000 m² → 1,000,000 / 2,589,988.110336 = 0.386102158542 mi² (approx. 0.3861 mi²).",
      "2,589,988.110336 m² → 2,589,988.110336 / 2,589,988.110336 = 1 mi² (exact)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor is exact because the international mile is defined exactly as 1,609.344 meters; squaring that linear definition yields an exact area factor of 2,589,988.110336 m² per square mile. Any approximation arises only from numeric rounding for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many square meters are in one square mile?",
        "answer": "One square mile equals exactly 2,589,988.110336 square meters based on the exact international definition of the mile."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose display precision?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For mapping and land-use planning, two to four significant digits in mi² may be sufficient; for engineering or regulatory submissions, follow your agency or standards guidance. Always document rounding rules used when reporting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for cadastral or legal land descriptions?",
        "answer": "This converter provides the mathematical conversion, but cadastral and legal land descriptions require consideration of the geodetic datum, projection, survey methodology, and certified measurement records. Consult national geodetic authorities and local land registries for official procedures and acceptance criteria."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do measurement uncertainty and projection distortions affect converted area values?",
        "answer": "Measurements from GPS, total stations, or remote sensing have inherent uncertainty; converting units does not remove that uncertainty. Additionally, map projections introduce area distortion. For accurate area reporting, apply appropriate projection corrections, quantify uncertainty, and reference calibration documentation from relevant authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find official standards or references for units and conversions?",
        "answer": "Refer to national and international standards bodies such as NIST and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) for unit definitions and SI guidance, and to national geodetic agencies for mapping and survey practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool handle compound conversions or multiple inputs?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a single fixed-ratio conversion from square meters to square miles for one input value. For compound calculations (for example, incorporating measurement uncertainty or multiple fields), use a dedicated calculation workflow or calculator designed for that purpose."
