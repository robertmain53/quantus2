    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes the periodic payment for a boat loan that includes a balloon payment due at the end of the term, and shows how a constant recurring extra payment per period changes the periodic outflow and estimated payoff time. Use the extra payment fields to model additional principal contributions applied each period.",
      "Outputs include the scheduled periodic payment (excluding extras), the periodic payment with extras, estimated total paid over the term (payments plus balloon), and a simple approximation of periods to payoff if you apply a constant extra payment each period. Results are for planning and comparison only."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We compute the periodic scheduled payment by solving the present-value annuity equation with a residual balloon balance: principal = payment * (1 - (1+r)^-N)/r + balloon/(1+r)^N, where r is the periodic interest rate and N is the total number of periods.",
      "To illustrate the effect of extra payments we add the recurring extra amount directly to the scheduled payment (this shows the immediate cashflow effect). An approximate analytic formula is used to estimate the number of periods to payoff when a constant extra payment is applied each period; this estimate assumes the extra is applied from the first period it is scheduled and that the interest rate and payment frequency remain constant."

      "Periodic rate r = (annual_interest_rate / 100) / payments_per_year",
      "Number of periods N = term_years * payments_per_year",
      "Scheduled periodic payment = [ r * (principal - balloon / (1 + r)^N ) ] / [1 - (1 + r)^(-N) ]",
      "Payment with extra = scheduled periodic payment + extra_payment",
      "Total paid over term = scheduled periodic payment * N + balloon",
      "Approx. periods to payoff with constant extra (analytic approximation) uses the standard loan payoff logarithmic relationship assuming no intermediate changes to payments or rate."

        "question": "Does this calculator amortize every payment and show a schedule?",
        "answer": "This tool computes summary values and an analytic approximation for payoff timing when a constant extra is applied. It does not output a full period-by-period amortization table. For an exact schedule with variable timing of extras, generate an amortization schedule using a spreadsheet or amortization tool that iterates period-by-period."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results if I enter a nonzero extra payment?",
        "answer": "The calculator shows the immediate effect of adding a recurring extra payment and gives an analytic estimate of periods-to-payoff. For precise payoff dates and interest savings when extras start or stop mid-term, use a period-by-period amortization engine. See the accuracy notes and standards references below."
