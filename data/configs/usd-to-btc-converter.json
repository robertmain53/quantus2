    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns an amount in United States dollars (USD) into Bitcoin (BTC) using the prevailing market spot price. It is intended for quick reference, accounting estimates, and planning — it does not execute trades or include platform or network fees.",
      "Results show the theoretical BTC amount based on the selected spot price. For on‑chain transfers, wallet minimums and the network fee (miner/validator fee) affect the final received amount. For exchange purchases, platform spreads and transaction fees will alter the executed price.",
      "Use the tool to estimate holdings, prepare reports, or check approximate value before initiating a transfer or trade. This tool is informational and not financial or tax advice; consult a licensed professional for decisions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use a single spot price expressed as USD per BTC to perform the conversion. The spot price should be sourced from a reliable market feed or an aggregation of multiple liquidity providers to approximate the mid‑market rate.",
      "Conversion is performed by dividing the USD amount by the spot price (USD per BTC) to yield BTC. When displaying the result, BTC is formatted with up to 8 decimal places to reflect satoshi precision (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis).",
      "Displayed values do not include exchange spreads, custody or trading fees, nor blockchain network fees. Where relevant, the tool indicates minimum transferable units (one satoshi) and recommends rounding rules to avoid presenting amounts smaller than the smallest Bitcoin unit.",
      "For compliance and recordkeeping, users should retain timestamps and the referenced spot price used for a conversion. Government guidance classifies virtual currency transactions for tax and reporting — consult official guidance for obligations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: BTC = USD ÷ SpotPrice_USD_per_BTC",
      "Inverse formula (for reference): USD = BTC × SpotPrice_USD_per_BTC",
      "Smallest on‑chain unit: 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC. Convert: satoshis = BTC × 100000000",
      "Rounding guidance: show up to 8 decimal places for BTC; values smaller than 1 satoshi are reported as 0.00000000 BTC or by showing the satoshi equivalent when precision is required."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 — If SpotPrice = 50,000 USD/BTC and you enter 100 USD, BTC = 100 ÷ 50,000 = 0.00200000 BTC (200,000 satoshis).",
      "Example 2 — If SpotPrice = 27,500 USD/BTC and you enter 1, USD, BTC = 1 ÷ 27,500 = 0.00003636 BTC (3,636 satoshis)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where does the spot price come from and how often does it update?",
        "answer": "The spot price should come from an aggregated market feed or a single trusted liquidity provider; frequency depends on the feed (many update in real time or every few seconds). For formal recordkeeping, capture the timestamp and the source of the spot price used in the conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter include exchange fees, spreads, or blockchain network fees?",
        "answer": "No. The converter returns the theoretical BTC amount using the spot price only. Actual executed amounts will differ because of exchange spreads, trading fees, custody fees, and blockchain network fees. Account for those separately when planning transfers or purchases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision do you use and why?",
        "answer": "Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places (one satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC). The converter displays up to 8 decimal places and shows the corresponding satoshi count so users understand the smallest transferable unit and avoid rounding surprises."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might a small USD amount show as 0.00000000 BTC?",
        "answer": "If the USD amount converts to less than one satoshi given the current spot price, the BTC display will round to 0.00000000 BTC. In such cases the converter can display the equivalent satoshi fraction or advise increasing the amount to reach one satoshi."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool executing a trade or moving funds?",
        "answer": "No. This is a reference calculator only. To buy, sell, or transfer Bitcoin you must use a custodial or non‑custodial wallet or an exchange service and accept their fees, limits, and compliance procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or tax considerations I should know?",
        "answer": "Yes. In many jurisdictions, converting fiat to cryptocurrency is a taxable event and subject to reporting and anti‑money laundering rules. Retain conversion timestamps and the spot price used for accurate records and consult official government guidance or a tax professional."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum transferable amount of Bitcoin?",
        "answer": "The smallest on‑chain unit is one satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). Some wallets or services may enforce higher minimums due to fee economics or service policies."
