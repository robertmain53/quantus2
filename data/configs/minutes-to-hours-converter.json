    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a quantity expressed in minutes into the equivalent number of hours using the fixed mathematical relationship that 1 hour = 60 minutes. The primary output is decimal hours (for example, 90 minutes → 1.5 hours).",
      "It is intended for everyday use (time tracking, payroll, scheduling) and for technical contexts where an exact minutes-to-hours conversion is required. Guidance on rounding, decimal hours versus hours-and-minutes formatting, and accuracy considerations is provided below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculation uses the internationally accepted relationship between minutes and hours: hours = minutes ÷ 60. This is a fixed unit conversion not dependent on context or external variables.",
      "For decimal-hour outputs used in payroll or billing, round according to your organizational policy (examples and common rounding rules are included). For high-assurance applications, follow numeric representation best practices per IEEE 754 for floating-point arithmetic and verify results against SI definitions from NIST."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: hours = minutes ÷ 60",
      "To express a decimal hour as hours and minutes: whole_hours = floor(decimal_hours); remaining_minutes = round((decimal_hours - whole_hours) × 60)",
      "Example: 135 minutes → 135 ÷ 60 = 2.25 hours → 2 hours and 15 minutes"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "45 minutes → 45 ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours (0 hours and 45 minutes)",
      "90 minutes → 90 ÷ 60 = 1.5 hours (1 hour and 30 minutes)",
      "7 minutes → 7 ÷ 60 ≈ 0.1166667 hours (round to policy-specified precision)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use decimal hours or hours-and-minutes for payroll?",
        "answer": "Use the format required by your payroll system. Many payroll systems use decimal hours (e.g., 1.25 hours) for calculations. When converting for payroll, apply the employer's rounding and minimum increment rules before summing totals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round converted values?",
        "answer": "Rounding depends on policy. Common practices: round to the nearest hundredth for decimal hours (two decimal places), or to the nearest 6-minute increment (0.1 hour). For financial calculations, follow your accounting rules and document the rounding method."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this converter handle very large or negative minute values?",
        "answer": "Mathematically yes. Very large values may be limited by the numeric range of the environment (floating-point limits). Negative values are converted using the same formula but represent negative time intervals; ensure negative durations are meaningful in your context."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The conversion is exact in rational arithmetic (minutes ÷ 60). In computing environments, representation and rounding follow IEEE 754 floating-point rules; small rounding differences may appear when displaying many decimal places. For traceable measurements, reference NIST and use sufficient precision for your use case."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool comply with any standards?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the SI-derived relationship between minutes and hours as recognized by national and international standards bodies. For numeric representation and rounding guidance consult IEEE 754 (floating-point) and applicable organizational or regulatory requirements for timekeeping."
