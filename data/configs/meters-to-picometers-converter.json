    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length given in meters (m) to picometers (pm). The relationship is exact within the International System of Units (SI): 1 meter equals 1,000,000,000,000 picometers (1 × 10^12 pm). Enter a single numeric value in meters to obtain the equivalent value in picometers.",
      "Practical uses include converting macroscopic measurements to atomic-scale units for comparison, preparing data for instruments that report very small lengths, and ensuring unit consistency in calculations. Results include guidance on rounding, expected numeric limits, and measurement-system considerations to help you interpret outputs correctly."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed SI relationship between meters and picometers. No empirical calibration factor is required for the mathematical conversion itself because it is a defined scaling factor of 10^12.",
      "When results are used in measurement, reporting, or regulated contexts, follow applicable standards for notation, uncertainty, and calibration. Key references include the NIST guidance on SI units and the ISO standards for quantities and units. For laboratory calibration of measurement instruments, consult ISO/IEC 17025 and national metrology institute guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core formula: value_in_pm = value_in_meters × 1,000,000,000,000 (1e12).",
      "Step 1: Accept input in meters (numeric). Step 2: Multiply by 1e12. Step 3: Apply chosen numeric formatting or significant-figure rules before display.",
      "Numeric notes: very large or very small numbers may exceed typical display precision in some environments; consider scientific notation and explicitly handle significant figures and rounding according to your reporting requirements."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 0.000000001 m → 1,000 pm (0.000000001 × 1e12 = 1,000)",
      "Example 2: 2 m → 2,000,000,000,000 pm (2 × 1e12 = 2e12)",
      "Example 3: 3.45e-10 m → 345 pm (3.45 × 10^-10 × 10^12 = 345)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The scaling factor between meters and picometers (10^12) is an exact, defined relationship within the SI system. Any approximation arises only from numeric rounding, display precision, or floating-point limitations in the computing environment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle significant figures and rounding?",
        "answer": "Apply significant-figure rules based on measurement uncertainty and reporting requirements. For computed conversions, carry sufficient internal precision and round only for final reporting. If measurements include uncertainty, propagate uncertainty through the multiplication rather than relying on simple rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits where this converter is unreliable?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is reliable for any finite numeric input. Practical limits arise from the platform's numeric range (overflow/underflow) and display precision. For extremely large or small values, use scientific notation and verify with a high-precision library if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate this converter?",
        "answer": "No calibration is required for the arithmetic conversion itself because it is a defined unit scaling. Calibration applies to instruments that measure length in meters; ensure those instruments are calibrated under ISO/IEC 17025 or equivalent to establish measurement traceability before conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which unit abbreviations are correct?",
        "answer": "Use 'm' for meters and 'pm' for picometers following SI conventions. When preparing formal reports, include full unit names on first use and indicate measurement uncertainty and traceability."
