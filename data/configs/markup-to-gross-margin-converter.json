    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a percent markup into the equivalent percent gross margin (and vice versa). Markup and margin are related but different measures: markup is based on cost, margin is based on selling price. Use the appropriate measure for pricing, reporting, or competitive comparison.",
      "The tool applies exact algebraic relationships to deliver results quickly. Results assume inputs are pure percentages (for example enter 50 for 50%). Review the methodology and examples to confirm the interpretation before using values for accounting or public reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We treat markup and margin as precise mathematical relationships derived from cost and selling price. No empirical fitting or approximations are used; conversions use algebraic rearrangement of price = cost × (1 + markup_decimal).",
      "Precision and numeric representation follow best-practice guidance for reporting computed values: round only for presentation, preserve sufficient internal precision for further calculations, and state rounding rules in downstream reports. For guidance on measurement uncertainty and numeric reproducibility consult NIST and IEEE standards listed in citations.",
      "This converter is an aid for analysis and pricing. It does not replace accounting systems or formal financial statements. Always reconcile with your accounting records and follow applicable regulatory reporting standards (for example local tax authority rules or industry-specific reporting standards)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definitions: markup_percent (m%) is based on cost; margin_percent (g%) is based on selling price.",
      "Step 1: convert percentage to decimal: markup_decimal = m% / 100.",
      "Step 2: price = cost × (1 + markup_decimal). Margin (decimal) = (price - cost) / price = markup_decimal / (1 + markup_decimal).",
      "Direct formula (percent): margin_percent = 100 × (m / (100 + m)).",
      "Reverse formula (percent): markup_percent = 100 × (g / (100 - g)).",
      "Examples are shown below to validate the algebra for common values."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Markup 50%. Compute margin: margin_percent = 100 × (50 / (100 + 50)) = 100 × (50 / 150) = 33.3333%.",
      "Example 2: Desired margin 40%. Compute required markup: markup_percent = 100 × (40 / (100 - 40)) = 100 × (40 / 60) = 66.6667%."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between markup and gross margin?",
        "answer": "Markup is the percentage added to cost to set the selling price. Gross margin is the percentage of the selling price that is gross profit. They use different bases: markup uses cost, margin uses selling price."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I enter values?",
        "answer": "Enter percentages as whole numbers or decimals representing percent (for example enter 50 for 50%). The tool converts internally to decimal form before applying formulas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative values or discounts?",
        "answer": "Yes; negative markup or margin can represent a loss or discount. The algebraic formulas remain valid, but interpret negative results carefully and confirm with accounting controls."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding or precision should I use?",
        "answer": "Keep at least four significant digits internally when chaining calculations. Present rounded values (commonly two decimal places) with an explicit statement of rounding. For critical financial reporting follow your organization's rounding policies and applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this include taxes, shipping, or other add-ons?",
        "answer": "No. This conversion treats cost and price as the base figures. If taxes or additional fees affect cost or final price, include them in your input values or perform separate calculations to incorporate their impact."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool certified or audited?",
        "answer": "This utility provides deterministic algebraic conversions. It is not a substitute for audited financial statements. For formal measurement uncertainty or software assurance follow NIST, ISO, and IEEE guidance referenced in citations."
