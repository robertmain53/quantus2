    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a markup percentage into the equivalent gross margin percentage and vice versa. Markup expresses profit relative to cost; gross margin expresses profit relative to selling price. Use this tool to check pricing, reconcile accounting reports, and communicate margins consistently across teams.",
      "The tool operates on the standard algebraic relationship between markup and margin. It is intended for quick, deterministic conversions for planning and reporting; it is not a substitute for full accounting systems or professional financial advice. Results are subject to input precision and rounding rules; see methodology and FAQs for limits and testing guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Derivation is purely algebraic: markup (M) = (Price - Cost) / Cost; margin (G) = (Price - Cost) / Price. Solve these definitions to get the conversion formulas shown below. No empirical data or approximations are used.",
      "Inputs are treated as percentages by default. Internally the calculator converts percentages to decimals (divide by 100), applies the algebraic formula, then converts back to percentage for display. Typical UI will accept either raw decimal or percent with clear labeling.",
      "Accuracy and verification guidance: follow established quality and testing practices when integrating this converter into software. For software development and testing, adhere to NIST guidance on software testing and verification, ISO quality management principles (for example ISO 9001) for process controls, IEEE best practices for numerical and software reliability, and applicable workplace safety and operational controls referenced by OSHA for broader operational compliance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Notation: markup (as decimal) = m, margin (as decimal) = g. Percent values are converted: m_percent / 100 = m; g_percent / 100 = g.",
      "To convert markup to margin: g = m / (1 + m). In percent form: margin% = (markup% / (100 + markup%)) * 100.",
      "To convert margin to markup: m = g / (1 - g). In percent form: markup% = (margin% / (100 - margin%)) * 100.",
      "Input and domain notes: markup must be greater than negative one because a markup of negative one would imply zero price. Margin must be less than one and greater than negative values corresponding to markup greater than negative one. Values at or beyond those limits are invalid."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Markup = 50%. As decimal m = 0.5. Margin g = 0.5 / (1 + 0.5) = 0.333333. Displayed result = 33.3333%.",
      "Example 2: Markup = 100%. m = 1.0. Margin g = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. Displayed result = 50%.",
      "Example 3: Margin = 20%. g = 0.2. Markup m = 0.2 / (1 - 0.2) = 0.25. Displayed result = 25%."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Markup and gross margin are different bases: markup is relative to cost, margin is relative to price.",
      "Conversion formulas are exact algebraic identities: margin = markup / (1 + markup) and markup = margin / (1 - margin).",
      "Validate inputs (avoid markup less than or equal to negative 100 percent, or margin greater than or equal to 100 percent). Apply consistent rounding rules when reporting percentages."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The conversion uses exact algebraic formulas. Any apparent approximation comes from rounding the displayed percentage. For high-precision needs, increase decimal places before final reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What input formats are supported and what are the domain limits?",
        "answer": "Inputs are percent values (for example 50 for 50%). Internally they are converted to decimals. Valid markup must be greater than negative 100 percent. Valid margin must be less than 100 percent. Values outside these ranges are invalid because they imply zero or negative selling price."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I see small differences when I reverse-convert?",
        "answer": "Small differences are due to rounding at the display precision. If you convert markup to margin and then back, preserve the full decimal precision internally to avoid rounding error. Use at least four decimal places for intermediate calculations when exact reconciliation is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this tool be used for regulatory reporting or automated billing?",
        "answer": "This tool is intended for quick conversions and planning. For automated billing, regulatory reporting, or financial statements, integrate rigorous input validation, unit tests, and audit trails. Follow NIST software testing recommendations, ISO 9001 process controls, and IEEE reliability practices when deploying in production systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for presentation?",
        "answer": "Rounding depends on context. For internal analysis two to four decimal places in percent form (e.g., 33.33% or 33.3333%) is common. For public reporting follow your organization's disclosure and rounding policy. Always document the rounding convention used."
