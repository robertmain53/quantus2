1. This is a converter because the task is a unit-to-unit conversion (gigabytes ↔ terabytes) with a fixed mathematical relationship where the user supplies one value and expects one output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays or arrays of objects where allowed).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
