    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates fuel economy values expressed in kilometres per litre (km/L) to miles per imperial gallon (mpg UK). It is intended for vehicle owners, fleet managers, and engineers who need a quick, traceable conversion between metric and imperial fuel economy units.",
      "The conversion follows standard unit definitions: kilometres to miles and litres to the imperial gallon. Results are appropriate for display, reporting, and quick engineering checks; check instrument and instrument calibration guidance in the FAQs before using values for regulatory compliance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply fixed, SI-consistent relationships between base length and volume units, then combine them to convert a rate (distance per volume). The method is deterministic and relies on published unit definitions from national metrology and energy agencies.",
      "Kilometres are converted to miles using the internationally accepted metre-to-mile relationship and litres are converted to gallons using the imperial gallon definition. This approach matches guidance from national measurement authorities and energy research groups.",
      "When higher precision is required for regulatory reporting or laboratory work, consult primary sources for the exact constants and perform conversions using the same constants to avoid small discrepancies due to rounding."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilometres to miles. 1 kilometre = 0.62137119223733 miles.",
      "Step 2: Convert per litre to per imperial gallon by multiplying miles per litre by the number of litres in an imperial gallon. 1 imperial gallon = 4.54609 litres.",
      "Combined formula: mpg (UK) = km_per_litre × 0.62137119223733 × 4.54609.",
      "Numeric factor (for reference): 1 km/L ≈ 2.824809 (mpg UK). Use the exact constants above for high-precision work."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 10 km/L → 10 × 0.62137119223733 × 4.54609 ≈ 28.25 mpg (UK).",
      "Example 2: 5.5 km/L → 5.5 × 0.62137119223733 × 4.54609 ≈ 15.54 mpg (UK)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why is there a difference between UK mpg and US mpg?",
        "answer": "The UK (imperial) gallon is larger than the US gallon (1 imperial gallon = 4.54609 L; 1 US gallon = 3.785411784 L). Converting km/L to mpg US uses a different volume factor, so results differ. Use the correct target gallon definition for accurate comparisons."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I display?",
        "answer": "For general use, two decimal places are usually sufficient. For engineering, lab, or regulatory work follow the precision rules required by the governing standard or laboratory protocol. When in doubt, carry full precision in calculations and round only for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "This converter provides a mathematically correct unit conversion. For regulatory submissions, verify the exact constants and rounding rules required by the reporting body and confirm instrument calibration and test-cycle methodology before submitting data."
      },
      {
        "question": "My onboard trip computer reports different values than this conversion. Why?",
        "answer": "Onboard computers estimate fuel economy from sensor data and may apply smoothing, fuel trims, or manufacturer-specific calibration which introduces differences. This tool performs a pure unit conversion and does not replicate on-vehicle filtering or measurement biases."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does instrumentation error affect converted values?",
        "answer": "Instrument error in distance or fuel volume measurement propagates through the conversion. A relative error in km/L (from sensors or fill-measurements) remains the same percentage when converted to mpg; only absolute numbers change. For critical measurements, rely on calibrated measurement equipment and documented uncertainty budgets."
      },
      {
        "question": "What constants are used and where do they come from?",
        "answer": "This converter uses internationally accepted constants for unit definitions: the kilometre-to-mile factor and the litre-to-imperial-gallon factor. These originate from national metrology institutes and energy research organizations. See citations for authoritative references."
