    "introduction": [
      "Convert area values from square meters (m²) to square millimeters (mm²) using the exact metric scaling. This tool implements the SI-consistent relationship between metres and millimetres so you get an exact, reproducible numeric result.",
      "Beyond raw conversion, the page offers practical guidance for applied users: how squaring a linear conversion affects precision, recommended rounding practices for reporting, and brief calibration and uncertainty cues relevant to lab and engineering contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is derived directly from SI unit scaling: 1 metre = 1,000 millimetres. Area conversions square the linear factor so the area factor is (1,000)² = 1,000,000. This is the exact mathematical relationship; no approximations are used.",
      "When converting measured values, carry forward measurement uncertainty and instrument resolution. For traceable measurements, follow national standards and accredited laboratory guidance (for example, NIST guidance and ISO/IEC 17025 principles) to document calibration, uncertainty, and significant-figure conventions.",
      "For engineering workflows, prefer reporting to a meaningful number of significant digits based on the least precise measurement and include units. For regulatory or procurement contexts, verify whether the receiving specification requires a particular unit or rounding rule before submission."

      "Linear relationship: 1 m = 1,000 mm.",
      "Square the linear factor for area: 1 m² = (1,000 mm)² = 1,000,000 mm².",
      "Apply to a value: Value_in_mm² = Value_in_m² × 1,000,000.",
      "Example: 2.5 m² → 2.5 × 1,000,000 = 2,500,000 mm²."

    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 0.001 m² = 0.001 × 1,000,000 = 1,000 mm².",
      "Example 2: 1 m² = 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000 mm².",
      "Example 3: 3.4567 m² ≈ 3,456,700 mm² (keep significant figures based on measurement resolution)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from m² to mm²?",
        "answer": "Exact factor: 1 m² = 1,000,000 mm² because 1 m = 1,000 mm and the linear factor is squared for area units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Round according to the precision of the original measurement and the tolerance required by your application. For measured inputs, carry and report uncertainty; for calculated geometry, choose significant digits consistent with design or regulatory requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "This converter returns the exact numerical conversion. Users should separately propagate instrument uncertainty and document calibration status according to standards such as ISO/IEC 17025 and national metrology guidance (e.g., NIST) when results are used for compliance or scientific reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does area use the square of the linear conversion?",
        "answer": "Area units are two-dimensional. Converting linear units (metres to millimetres) multiplies each linear dimension by 1,000; the combined area multiplier is the product of both linear multipliers: 1,000 × 1,000 = 1,000,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I prefer mm² over m²?",
        "answer": "Use mm² when working with very small features, precision machining, electronics, or specifications where millimetre-scale resolution is the norm. Use m² for larger areas such as rooms, land, or building floors. Choose the unit that aligns with the measurement resolution and specification context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or procurement considerations I should know?",
        "answer": "Yes. Many specifications and procurement documents require specific units and may mandate rounding or tolerance statements. For traceability and formal reporting, follow national metrology and accreditation guidance (for example, NIST recommendations and ISO standards) and include calibration information if measurements were used."
