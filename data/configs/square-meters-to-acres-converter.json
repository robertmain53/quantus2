    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts area in square meters (m²) to acres (ac) using the standardized international relationship between SI area units and traditional land-area units.",
      "The conversion factor is fixed by international measurement conventions and is suitable for engineering calculations, GIS workflows, planning estimates, and general use. For legal land surveys or property deeds, consult your licensed surveyor or local cadastral authority as regulations and rounding rules may differ.",
      "Results are presented with full-precision internally; display rounding is configurable in many tools — consider required tolerance before reporting (see FAQs for guidance on precision and regulatory considerations)."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the exact internationally accepted equivalence between acres and square meters. The canonical value used here is: 1 acre = 4,046.8564224 square meters.",
      "To convert, the calculator divides the input in square meters by 4,046.8564224 to produce acres. This factor is consistent with national metrology and international standards (see citations)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Canonical relationships used:",
      "1 acre = 4,046.8564224 m²",
      "Therefore: acres = square_meters ÷ 4,046.8564224",
      "Equivalently: 1 m² = 0.00024710538146716535 acres (approx). Use division for conversion to acres and multiplication by 4,046.8564224 to convert acres to m²."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 m² → acres = 1000 ÷ 4,046.8564224 ≈ 0.247105381 acres",
      "5,000 m² → acres = 5000 ÷ 4,046.8564224 ≈ 1.235526905 acres",
      "4046.8564224 m² → acres = 4046.8564224 ÷ 4,046.8564224 = 1 acre"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor do you use?",
        "answer": "We use the internationally accepted value 1 acre = 4,046.8564224 square meters, which is consistent with national metrology institutes and international SI guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "That depends on use: for high-precision engineering or GIS workflows keep at least six decimal places for acres; for general land area summaries two to three decimal places is common. For legal documents follow the rules of the local land registry or a licensed surveyor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for legal surveys or property titles?",
        "answer": "This tool provides mathematical conversions only. Legal surveys require certified measurements and may use jurisdictional rounding, tie-breaker rules, or preferred units. Consult a licensed surveyor or your local cadastral authority for legally binding figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from acres to square meters?",
        "answer": "Multiply acres by 4,046.8564224. Example: 2 acres × 4,046.8564224 = 8,093.7128448 m²."
      },
      {
        "question": "I have measurements with instrument uncertainty. How should I treat uncertainties when converting?",
        "answer": "Convert the central value with the same factor and propagate uncertainty by dividing the absolute uncertainty in m² by 4,046.8564224 to get the uncertainty in acres. For percentage or relative uncertainties, the relative uncertainty remains the same under this linear conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert large lists or CSV files of areas?",
        "answer": "Yes. For batch conversions export your values as numeric square-meter fields and apply the same division by 4,046.8564224 programmatically (spreadsheet formula: =A2/4046.8564224). Ensure numeric formatting preserves required precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regional variants of the acre?",
        "answer": "The international acre used here is the standard (international acre). Historical or regional acres (for example, some traditional local units) can differ; confirm unit definitions before converting historical data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where does this factor come from and who publishes it?",
        "answer": "The factor is published and maintained by national metrology institutes and international standards organizations. See the cited references (NIST, BIPM) for official guidance and SI relationships."
