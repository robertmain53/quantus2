    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a single numeric value in hours into the equivalent number of calendar weeks using the fixed conversion that one week equals seven days (168 hours). It is intended for clear, repeatable conversions where weeks are counted as contiguous seven-day periods.",
      "If you need to convert hours into a regulatory or payroll \"work week\" (which can vary by jurisdiction or employer), note that this tool produces calendar weeks. See the methodology and FAQs for guidance on applying the result to work-week, payroll, or compliance contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed using a constant, exact relationship: 1 week = 7 days = 168 hours. That relationship is a simple arithmetic ratio and does not require interpolation, lookup tables, or calendar-specific adjustments.",
      "For regulatory or operational uses (payroll, overtime, scheduling), confirm whether local rules define a work week differently from the calendar week. When using results for reporting or compliance, round or truncate per your local standards and document the rounding method.",
      "Accuracy considerations: the arithmetic conversion is exact in rational arithmetic. When representing results in floating point, small rounding differences can occur; report results with an appropriate number of decimal places and disclose rounding rules where required by policy or regulation."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Recognize the fixed equivalence: 1 week = 7 days = 168 hours.",
      "Step 2: Divide the number of hours by 168 to obtain weeks. Formula: weeks = hours ÷ 168.",
      "Step 3: Apply rounding only if required (for display or regulatory reporting). For example, round to two decimal places for general reporting, or follow specific regulatory precision rules if applicable."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 168 hours → 168 ÷ 168 = 1 week.",
      "Example 2: 336 hours → 336 ÷ 168 = 2 weeks.",
      "Example 3: 40 hours → 40 ÷ 168 ≈ 0.238095 weeks (about 0.24 weeks when rounded to two decimal places)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this converter use calendar weeks or work weeks?",
        "answer": "This converter returns calendar weeks where 1 week = 7 days = 168 hours. A work week used for payroll or labor rules may differ (for example, 35, 37.5, or 40 hours). Use the output as a calendar-based measure; for payroll use transform the input hours according to your employer or jurisdictional definition of a work week."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result for reporting?",
        "answer": "Rounding depends on your use case. For general display, two decimal places is common. For compliance or payroll, follow the applicable regulation or company policy and disclose the rounding method. Small floating-point differences are expected when using decimal representations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative or very large hour values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Negative values represent negative durations (e.g., debt of hours) and convert using the same formula. Very large values convert correctly mathematically, but be mindful of numeric limits in your environment and present results with appropriate precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is daylight saving time considered?",
        "answer": "No. Daylight saving time adjustments affect clock time but do not change the fixed length of a calendar week. If you need to convert clock-stamped intervals across DST transitions, use a calendar-aware datetime tool instead of a pure hours-to-weeks ratio."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are leap seconds relevant?",
        "answer": "Leap seconds are adjustments to Coordinated Universal Time for astronomical reasons and are not relevant to the simple hours-to-weeks arithmetic used here. For high-precision timekeeping and scientific use, consult time standards documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship (weeks = hours ÷ 168) is exact. Presentation accuracy depends on numeric representation and rounding. For audit or regulatory purposes, state your rounding approach and verify with applicable standards or policies."
