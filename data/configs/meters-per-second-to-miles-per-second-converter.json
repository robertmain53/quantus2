    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a speed value expressed in meters per second (m/s) into miles per second (mi/s). The conversion is a direct scaling of the length unit (meters to miles) while preserving the per-second time base.",
      "Use this tool for quick, high-confidence conversions in engineering notes, data analysis, and documentation. For measurement results used in regulated work (calibration certificates, safety reports), ensure the measuring instruments and methods are traceable to recognized standards and local regulatory requirements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the fixed international length relationship 1 mile = 1609.344 meters. The exact multiplicative constant used is 1 meter = 0.00062137119223733 miles. This constant is standard in engineering and science and is consistent with SI and international unit definitions.",
      "Conversion logic is purely arithmetic and assumes classical (non-relativistic) kinematics. For high-speed scenarios approaching a significant fraction of the speed of light, consult relativistic formulas instead of linear unit conversion.",
      "Recommendations for trustworthy measurements: follow traceability and calibration practices (for example, instruments and labs accredited or traceable to national metrology institutes), and document measurement uncertainty per ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the input speed in meters per second (m/s).",
      "Step 2: Multiply by the meters-to-miles factor: miles_per_second = meters_per_second × 0.00062137119223733.",
      "Inverse conversion: meters_per_second = miles_per_second × 1609.344.",
      "Rounding and display: choose an appropriate number of decimal places based on the measurement uncertainty and use IEEE 754-aware arithmetic for reproducible floating-point behavior when implementing in software."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 m/s → 0.00062137119223733 mi/s (multiply 1 by 0.00062137119223733).",
      "10 m/s → 0.0062137119223733 mi/s.",
      "343 m/s (approximate speed of sound at sea level) → ≈ 0.2131 mi/s."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion uses an exact integer definition for 1 mile = 1609.344 meters (by international agreement). The arithmetic multiplier shown is a fixed representation of that ratio. In practice, numeric results are subject to the display rounding and the computational floating-point precision used."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision should I use for engineering work?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places to reflect the measurement uncertainty of your input. For instrument-derived speeds, propagate the instrument uncertainty and round the final result accordingly. For documentation requiring accredited results, follow ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance on reporting uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for relativistic effects at very high speeds?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a classical unit scaling. For velocities where relativistic effects are non-negligible (significant fraction of the speed of light), use special-relativity formulas rather than simple unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does floating-point rounding affect the result?",
        "answer": "Software implementations typically use IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic. Very large or very small inputs can introduce rounding errors; for critical uses, use high-precision numeric types or validated unit libraries and document the numeric method and precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is miles per second commonly used?",
        "answer": "Miles per second is a valid unit but uncommon for everyday speeds. It is more typical in astrophysics or ballistic contexts. For ground transportation and most engineering contexts, miles per hour or meters per second are more commonly used."
