1. This is a converter because kilobits → kilobytes is a fixed, single-input unit conversion with a direct mathematical relationship and no intermediate variables.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" for that reason.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and may include optional examples or glossary arrays if helpful).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, form for converters, or other extra fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
