    "introduction": [
      "This calculator converts a mass in kilograms to a volume in cubic metres using the material density (kg/m³). Because mass-to-volume conversion requires the substance density, supply the appropriate density for the material or fluid you are measuring.",
      "Typical uses include estimating containers and storage volumes, recipe and ingredient scaling, laboratory sample preparation, and engineering material takeoffs. If you do not know the density, consult material property tables from standards bodies or supplier certificates."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The physical relationship used is Volume = Mass ÷ Density. We take mass in kilograms and density in kilograms per cubic metre to produce volume in cubic metres, consistent with SI units defined by standards organizations.",
      "Enter mass (kg) and the material density (kg/m³). The calculator performs a straightforward division and returns volume in cubic metres. For highest accuracy, use density values measured under the same temperature and pressure conditions as your mass measurement."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: V (m³) = m (kg) / ρ (kg/m³).",
      "Step 1: Input mass in kilograms (mass_kg). Step 2: Input density in kilograms per cubic metre (density_kg_m3). Step 3: Calculator computes volume_m3 = mass_kg / density_kg_m3.",
      "Practical note: If density is given in other units (g/cm³ or kg/L), convert to kg/m³ before using: 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³; 1 kg/L = 1000 kg/m³."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What density should I use if my material’s density varies?",
        "answer": "Use the density representative of the material state you have (temperature, pressure, porosity, moisture). For heterogeneous materials provide a bulk or apparent density measured under representative conditions. When in doubt, use supplier data sheets or measured averages and note uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this if I only have density in g/cm³ or kg/L?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert those units to kg/m³ first: multiply g/cm³ or kg/L by 1000 to get kg/m³ (for example, 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³). Then enter the converted density into the calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Match the significant figures to the least precise measurement among mass and density. If mass is measured to three significant figures and density to four, report results to three significant figures and state the assumed density and measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do temperature and pressure affect density?",
        "answer": "Yes. Temperature and, for compressible fluids, pressure change density. Use density values measured or corrected to the same conditions as your mass measurement. For critical processes, consult standards or laboratory calibration procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do instrument limits and calibration affect the result?",
        "answer": "Scale and balance resolution set the mass measurement precision; volume uncertainty propagates from both mass and density uncertainties. Regularly calibrate scales and use traceable density measurements when regulatory or safety margins apply."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative density values?",
        "answer": "Authoritative sources include material safety data sheets (MSDS), supplier technical data sheets, and national reference databases for chemical and material properties. For critical applications, use peer-reviewed property tables or laboratory measurement with documented traceability."
