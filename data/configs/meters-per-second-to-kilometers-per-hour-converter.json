    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a speed value given in meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/h). The relationship between these two SI-derived units is fixed and exact, so the conversion is deterministic and suitable for engineering, transportation planning, instrumentation, and everyday use.",
      "Because the conversion is an exact linear factor, it is appropriate for automated calculators, data processing pipelines, and documentation. However, when converting measured speeds rather than nominal values, consider sensor uncertainty, sampling, and rounding rules to preserve required accuracy for your application.",
      "This page provides the simple conversion, a short derivation, practical examples, frequently asked questions about precision and traceability, and citations to standards and authoritative guidance on units and calibration."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the definitions of the units: 1 kilometer = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Combining those definitions gives an exact multiplier between the two units.",
      "Because this is a pure unit conversion (no empirical coefficients), the mathematical relation is exact. Practical accuracy for measured speeds depends on the instrument, sampling method, and calibration traceable to national metrology institutes; follow ISO/IEC 17025 for accredited calibration and NIST guidance for SI unit practice.",
      "When presenting converted results, choose the number of significant digits to reflect the least precise measurement in the workflow. For regulated or safety-critical contexts, document measurement uncertainty and calibration intervals per applicable industry standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: km/h = m/s × 3.6",
      "Derivation: 1 m/s = (1 meter / 1 second) × (3600 seconds / 1000 meters) = 3.6 kilometers per hour, therefore multiply values in m/s by 3.6 to get km/h.",
      "Reverse conversion: m/s = km/h ÷ 3.6",
      "Rounding recommendation: retain at least the same number of significant figures as the input measurement; for display, round to an appropriate decimal place (for example, two decimal places for laboratory data, one or none for rounded traffic speeds)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2.0 m/s → 2.0 × 3.6 = 7.2 km/h",
      "5 m/s → 5 × 3.6 = 18.0 km/h",
      "0.27778 m/s → 0.27778 × 3.6 = 1.000008 km/h (practically 1.00 km/h when rounded to two decimals)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why is the conversion factor 3.6?",
        "answer": "The factor comes from converting meters to kilometers (1 km = 1000 m) and seconds to hours (1 h = 3600 s). Combining these gives 3600/1000 = 3.6 exactly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion factor is exact. Any approximation arises only from the precision of the numeric representation or from the uncertainty in measured input values."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show in results?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant digits to the measurement's precision. For instrumented measurements, propagate uncertainty and display results consistent with that uncertainty. For reporting or UI, common choices are 1–2 decimals for speeds in km/h and 2–3 decimals for small laboratory speeds in m/s."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate sensors before using this converter with measured data?",
        "answer": "Yes. For reliable measurements, have sensors calibrated and traceable to national standards. Calibration and measurement processes should follow applicable standards such as ISO/IEC 17025 and guidance from national metrology institutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety standards I should check when using converted speeds?",
        "answer": "For safety-critical or regulated contexts (traffic engineering, occupational safety, laboratory testing), consult relevant industry standards and local regulations. Good practice includes documenting uncertainty, calibration status, and any conversions used in calculations."
