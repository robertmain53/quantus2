    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms speed measurements from Meters per Second to Kilometers per Hour, enabling translation of physics calculations to practical speed units.",
      "Physics and engineering use m/s for precise calculations, while everyday applications use km/h. This conversion bridges scientific and practical speed measurements.",
      "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 m/s equals 3.6 km/h."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 m/s = 3.6 km/h. To convert m/s to km/h, multiply by 3.6. For example, 10 m/s = 36 km/h, 5 m/s = 18 km/h.",
      "Physics problems solve in m/s because it's the SI unit, but vehicle speeds are naturally expressed in km/h. Converting between enables comparison.",
      "Wind speed, water flow, and object velocity are all measured in m/s in scientific contexts but reported in km/h for practical understanding.",
      "This converter provides precise speed conversions for physics, engineering, and transportation applications."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Vehicle speed: 10 m/s = 36 km/h, typical city traffic speed.",
      "Example 2 – Wind speed: 15 m/s = 54 km/h, strong wind advisory level.",
      "Example 3 – Projectile motion: A ball traveling at 20 m/s = 72 km/h, useful for understanding sports velocity."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from m/s to km/h?",
        "answer": "1 m/s = 3.6 km/h. Multiply m/s by 3.6 to get km/h."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use m/s in physics?",
        "answer": "m/s is the SI unit, making physics equations simpler and more consistent. km/h is practical but not scientifically standard."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are typical speeds in m/s and km/h?",
        "answer": "Walking: 1.4 m/s ≈ 5 km/h; Cycling: 6 m/s ≈ 22 km/h; Highway: 30 m/s ≈ 108 km/h."
