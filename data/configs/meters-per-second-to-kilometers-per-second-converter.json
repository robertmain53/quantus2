    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a speed value given in meters per second (m/s) into kilometers per second (km/s) using the exact metric relationship between meters and kilometers. It is intended for quick, reliable unit conversion for engineering, science, education, and general use.",
      "The numerical conversion is exact in arithmetic terms, but any real-world measurement includes instrument uncertainty and rounding choices. See the methodology and accuracy notes below for how to report converted values in compliance with common measurement and documentation standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed metric relationship: 1 kilometer equals 1,000 meters. No approximations are required for the unit factor itself.",
      "For reporting and documentation, follow national and international guidance on measurement uncertainty and significant figures. Relevant standards and guidance include NIST publications on SI units and measurement practice, ISO 80000 series for quantities and units, and IEEE style guidance for engineering documentation.",
      "When conversions are part of safety-critical calculations or regulatory reporting, follow applicable workplace and safety standards such as OSHA requirements for recordkeeping and any industry-specific standards for measurement traceability and instrument calibration."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply or divide by the metric ratio between meters and kilometers. Since 1 km = 1000 m, the conversion factor from meters per second to kilometers per second is 0.001.",
      "Formula: speed_km_per_s = speed_m_per_s × 0.001.",
      "Step-by-step: take the speed value in m/s, multiply by 0.001, then round or format according to the desired number of significant figures or decimal places consistent with measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5 m/s → 5 × 0.001 = 0.005 km/s",
      "250 m/s → 250 × 0.001 = 0.250 km/s (report as 0.25 km/s if limited to two significant figures)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Conversion is exact mathematically using factor 0.001 (1 m/s = 0.001 km/s).",
      "Adjust displayed precision to reflect measurement uncertainty and reporting standards."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The metric factor between meters and kilometers is exact (1 km = 1000 m), so the arithmetic conversion factor 0.001 is exact. Any uncertainty arises from measurement of the original quantity and rounding for reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places or significant figures based on the precision of the original measurement and applicable reporting standards. For instrument-derived values include uncertainty estimates when required by standards (for example, follow NIST and ISO guidance)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative speeds?",
        "answer": "Yes. Negative values are mathematically valid and represent direction in many contexts. Ensure the sign convention matches the measurement system and documentation practice used in your project."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this relate to m/s to km/h conversions?",
        "answer": "Meters per second to kilometers per hour uses a different factor: multiply m/s by 3.6 to get km/h. That conversion is not performed by this tool but follows the same principle of exact metric relationships."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do for high-precision engineering work?",
        "answer": "Use instrument calibration records and propagate measurement uncertainty through the conversion. Document the number of significant figures and the uncertainty range in line with NIST and ISO measurement guidance."
