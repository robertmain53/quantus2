    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass value in grams (g) to kilograms (kg). The mathematical relationship is fixed: 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams, so the conversion multiplies grams by 0.001.",
      "While the arithmetic conversion is exact, real-world results depend on how the input mass was measured. See the guidance below on calibration, uncertainty and relevant standards to ensure measurement traceability and safe use in regulated contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the International System of Units (SI) definition for gram and kilogram. The conversion factor is derived from SI: 1 kg = 1000 g, therefore kg = g × 0.001.",
      "For applications requiring documented accuracy (laboratory, trade, manufacturing, clinical), treat this converter as a unit conversion utility only. Measurement uncertainty, scale calibration, environmental factors and legal-for-trade certification must be managed separately according to recognized standards.",
      "Recommended practices include using calibrated instruments traceable to national metrology institutes, keeping calibration records, and following the relevant ISO and NIST guidance for quantities and units."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: kilograms = grams × 0.001",
      "Step 1: Take the measured value in grams (numeric). Step 2: Multiply by 0.001 to obtain kilograms. Step 3: Report the result together with the measurement uncertainty and the number of significant digits appropriate to the measuring instrument."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 g → 500 × 0.001 = 0.5 kg",
      "1,250 g → 1,250 × 0.001 = 1.25 kg",
      "0 g → 0 × 0.001 = 0 kg"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion factor (0.001) is exact within the SI system. However, values reported from physical measurements carry uncertainty from the measuring device, so the converted value inherits that measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match the number of decimal places to the measurement instrument's resolution and uncertainty. Do not imply greater precision than the scale provides; document the instrument resolution and expanded uncertainty when precision matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate my scale before converting?",
        "answer": "Yes for regulated, trade, clinical, or safety-critical uses. Calibration establishes traceability to national standards. Follow manufacturer instructions and the calibration intervals required by your quality system or regulation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does gravity affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "The conversion between grams and kilograms is a mass-to-mass conversion and is independent of local gravity. If you measure weight (force) with a spring scale and infer mass, gravitational variation and instrument calibration can introduce error."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standards should I follow for traceability and units?",
        "answer": "Follow the International System of Units (SI) guidance and national metrology traceability requirements. See NIST and ISO standards for unit definitions and documentation, and consult applicable workplace or industry standards for calibration frequency and allowable tolerances."
