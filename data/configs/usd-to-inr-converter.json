    "introduction": [
      "Convert USD to INR quickly and transparently. This calculator multiplies the USD amount by the exchange rate you provide (or an indicative rate) and then applies percentage and fixed fees to show both gross conversion and net funds you would receive.",
      "Exchange rates fluctuate continuously; this tool uses the rate you enter. For live market rates, consult financial institutions or central bank publications. Always confirm the final rate and fees with your payment provider before completing a transfer."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We perform a straightforward, auditable calculation: gross conversion = USD amount × exchange rate. Fees can be specified as a percentage of the gross INR amount and/or a fixed INR fee. Net amount = gross conversion − total fees.",
      "This approach aligns with standard operational practice used by banks and remittance providers. For regulatory and consumer-protection context, refer to central bank guidance and financial crime prevention resources listed in the citations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Gross conversion: multiply the USD amount by the exchange rate you provide: converted_inr = amount_usd × exchange_rate.",
      "Step 2 — Percentage fee (if any): fee_percent_inr = converted_inr × (fee_percent / 100).",
      "Step 3 — Total fees: total_fees_inr = fee_percent_inr + fee_fixed_inr.",
      "Step 4 — Net received: total_after_fees_inr = converted_inr − total_fees_inr.",
      "Rounding is applied to the decimal places you select for display. Final settlement values on transfers may differ slightly due to provider rounding rules and timing."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where should I get the exchange rate I enter?",
        "answer": "Use the live mid-market or provider-supplied rate. Central banks publish indicative rates (for example, the Reserve Bank of India). Payment providers may add a margin; always confirm the final rate with your provider before a transfer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do different services show different INR amounts for the same USD?",
        "answer": "Providers may offer different exchange rates (including markups) and apply different fees or rounding. Timing and liquidity also affect the available rate. Compare both the exchange rate and total fees to assess the true cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include regulatory or compliance fees?",
        "answer": "No—this calculator only applies the percentage and fixed fees you enter. Actual transactions may incur additional intermediary bank charges, taxes, or compliance-related holds depending on the corridor and provider."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the results?",
        "answer": "Results are as precise as the inputs. Use the 'Decimal places for INR' control to set display precision. Final settlement amounts may round differently; treat this tool as an estimate and verify with your provider."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there transaction limits or reporting requirements I should know about?",
        "answer": "Large transfers may be subject to reporting, documentation, or source-of-funds checks under applicable anti-money-laundering (AML) and tax rules. Check guidance from your national financial regulator or central bank for thresholds and requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for accounting or legal settlement values?",
        "answer": "This calculator provides indicative conversion and fee math. For legally binding or accounting figures use provider-confirmed rates and settlement receipts. Consult official guidance from tax authorities or your finance team when recording transactions."
