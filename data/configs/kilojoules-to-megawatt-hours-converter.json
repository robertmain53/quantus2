    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts energy expressed in kilojoules (kJ) to megawatt-hours (MWh) using SI-consistent definitions. It is intended for engineers, analysts, and technical users who need a quick, auditable conversion for reporting, design checks, or data normalization.",
      "The conversion is based on the international definitions of the joule and watt-hour: 1 joule (J) is the SI unit of energy, 1 watt-hour (Wh) = 3600 J, and metric prefixes apply (kilo = 10^3, mega = 10^6). For regulatory reporting and engineering work, use the conversion shown here and document the factor and significant figures you applied."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Start from SI base units: 1 kilojoule = 1,000 joules. 1 watt-hour = 3,600 joules, therefore 1 megawatt-hour = 1,000,000 watt-hours = 3,600,000,000 joules.",
      "To convert kJ to MWh, first convert kilojoules to joules (multiply by 1,000), then divide by the number of joules in a megawatt-hour (3,600,000,000 J). Algebraically this reduces to a single fixed factor: divide kJ by 3,600,000.",
      "When using this converter for compliance or engineering deliverables, record the number of significant digits reported and check instrument uncertainty. For example, when converting meter outputs or calorimeter readings, propagate measurement uncertainty (standard deviation, calibration uncertainty) before rounding the final MWh value."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Key relationships: 1 kJ = 1,000 J. 1 Wh = 3,600 J. 1 MWh = 1,000,000 Wh = 3,600,000,000 J.",
      "Combined factor: 1 MWh = 3,600,000 kJ. Therefore: MWh = kJ ÷ 3,600,000.",
      "Practical step: input value in kJ → divide by 3,600,000 → result in MWh. Example formula: MWh = kJ / 3_600_000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 3,600,000 kJ → 3,600,000 ÷ 3,600,000 = 1.0 MWh.",
      "Example 2: 15,000 kJ → 15,000 ÷ 3,600,000 = 0.0041667 MWh (rounded to 0.00417 MWh for 5 significant figures).",
      "Example 3 (large scale): 3.6e9 kJ → 3.6e9 ÷ 3,600,000 = 1000 MWh."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact numeric relationship between kJ and MWh?",
        "answer": "Exactly: 1 MWh = 3,600,000 kJ. Equivalently, 1 kJ = 2.7777777777778e-7 MWh, so MWh = kJ ÷ 3,600,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the least precise input measurement and to reporting requirements. For metering or regulatory reporting, follow your agency or client guidance (often 3–6 significant figures) and propagate measurement uncertainty before final rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for measurement uncertainty or calibration error?",
        "answer": "No — this converter applies an exact mathematical factor. To include uncertainty, propagate your instrument's calibration uncertainty, repeatability, and any data processing error separately and report MWh ± uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use kJ versus MWh?",
        "answer": "Use kJ for laboratory-scale energy measurements, calorimetry, and chemical calculations. Use MWh for electrical energy at grid or facility scales and for utility reporting where larger units improve readability and consistency with industry standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards references I should follow when reporting energy?",
        "answer": "Yes. For national and international reporting, follow guidance from standards bodies and agencies (for example, NIST guidance on units and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on reporting units). Check sector-specific regulations for rounding, energy accounting methods, and audit requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What practical instrument limits should I consider?",
        "answer": "Consider instrument resolution, calibration interval, ambient conditions, and the measurement method. For calorimeters, account for heat losses; for electrical meters, check accuracy class and transformer ratios. Record the calibration certificate and measurement uncertainty with any reported MWh values."
