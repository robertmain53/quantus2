    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms gigabytes to bits for transfer time calculation.",
      "Network calculations require expressing GB in bits to match bps rates.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 gigabyte equals 8 billion bits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 GB = 8,000,000,000 bits. To convert GB to bits, multiply by 8 billion.",
      "Transfer time = File size (bits) / Speed (bps). Requires same units.",
      "Understanding GB to bits conversion enables accurate transfer estimates.",
      "This converter provides practical data conversion."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – 1 GB file = 8,000,000,000 bits.",
      "Example 2 – 2 GB file = 16,000,000,000 bits.",
      "Example 3 – 100 GB file = 800,000,000,000 bits."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How long to transfer 1 GB?",
        "answer": "At 10 Mbps: 800 seconds (13 min). At 100 Mbps: 80 sec. At 1 Gbps: 8 sec."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much is a gigabyte?",
        "answer": "1 billion bytes = 1,000 MB. Can hold ~250 high-res photos."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I buy external drive or cloud?",
        "answer": "External: faster, no subscription. Cloud: convenient, redundant, accessible anywhere."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the fastest transfer method?",
        "answer": "Thunderbolt 3/4: 5 GB/s. USB 3.1: 1.2 GB/s. WiFi 6: ~600 Mbps (~75 MB/s)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is actual transfer slower than rated?",
        "answer": "Overhead, processor limits, destination device limits. Rates are theoretical max."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I accelerate transfers?",
        "answer": "Use fastest available interface. Wired faster than wireless. External devices affect speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's cloud sync speed?",
        "answer": "Depends on internet: 10 Mbps (1.25 MB/s) to 1 Gbps (125 MB/s) typical."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is incremental backup faster?",
        "answer": "Yes. Only changed files transfer. Full backup slower but comprehensive."
