    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a mass value in grams (g) to milligrams (mg) using the International System of Units relationship. The mathematical relationship is exact within the SI system: 1 gram equals 1000 milligrams.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversions in lab notes, recipes, packaging labels, and calculations. For regulated measurements and legal reporting, follow calibration and traceability guidance described below to ensure measurement validity."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the SI relationship between gram and milligram. No approximation is required: 1 g = 1000 mg. For digital displays and reporting, choose an appropriate number of significant digits based on instrument resolution and regulatory requirements.",
      "Measurement guidance: use calibrated balances appropriate to the mass range. Maintain calibration and traceability to national standards as recommended by NIST and ISO to support measurement validity and compliance.",
      "Accuracy caveats: numerical conversion does not correct for instrument error, drift, rounding, or environmental effects (temperature, buoyancy, vibration). Follow standard metrology practices (for example, NIST calibration guidance and ISO/IEC measurement management recommendations) when conversions support regulated decisions."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base relationship: 1 gram (g) = 1000 milligrams (mg).",
      "To convert grams to milligrams: multiply the value in grams by 1000. Example: X g × 1000 = Y mg.",
      "To convert milligrams to grams: divide the value in milligrams by 1000. Example: X mg ÷ 1000 = Y g."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 g → 1 × 1000 = 1000 mg.",
      "0.25 g → 0.25 × 1000 = 250 mg.",
      "0.0005 g → 0.0005 × 1000 = 0.5 mg."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This converter implements the exact SI scaling factor between grams and milligrams. Use calibrated instruments and documented traceability for measurements used in regulated contexts.",
      "For reporting, set displayed precision to match the calibrated resolution of your weighing instrument and include uncertainty or tolerance where required by standards or internal quality procedures."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the grams-to-milligrams conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. Within the SI system the mathematical relationship is exact: 1 gram equals 1000 milligrams. Practical measurement uncertainty comes from instruments and procedures, not from the conversion factor itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match decimal places to the calibrated resolution of your scale and to the requirements of the context (lab report, labeling, regulatory filing). Do not imply greater precision than the instrument supports; report uncertainty when required by standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need legally defensible measurements?",
        "answer": "Use calibrated instruments with traceability to national metrology institutes, follow documented procedures, and retain calibration certificates and measurement uncertainty statements. Refer to national guidance (for example NIST) and relevant ISO standards for measurement management."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter correct for measurement error?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a unit conversion only. It does not apply instrument-specific corrections, buoyancy adjustments, or uncertainty propagation. Apply corrections and uncertainty analysis separately following accepted metrology practices."
