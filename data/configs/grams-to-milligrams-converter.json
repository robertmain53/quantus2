    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts mass values from grams (g) to milligrams (mg). The relationship between these units is fixed in the International System of Units (SI): one gram equals one thousand milligrams.",
      "Use this converter for quick, exact numerical conversions in calculations, recipes, lab notes, and documentation. For measurement reporting in regulated contexts, follow the instrument manufacturer's specifications, calibration traceability, and applicable standards referenced below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the exact metric prefix relationship: milli- means one thousandth. Converting grams to milligrams multiplies the gram value by 1,000.",
      "This tool performs a mathematical conversion only and does not change or estimate measurement uncertainty, instrument bias, or calibration error. For laboratory-grade reporting, ensure instruments are calibrated and traceable to national standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: milligrams = grams × 1000",
      "Step 1: Take the numeric value in grams.",
      "Step 2: Multiply by 1000 to get the value in milligrams."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.5 g × 1000 = 500 mg",
      "2 g × 1000 = 2000 mg",
      "0.001 g × 1000 = 1 mg"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion (1 g = 1000 mg) is exact. Any uncertainty comes from measurement instruments and rounding choices, not from the unit relationship."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for reporting?",
        "answer": "Round according to the required significant figures or decimal places for your context. For laboratory reports follow your accreditation rules (for example ISO/IEC 17025) and the measurement uncertainty stated for your instrument."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for scale accuracy or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator converts numeric values between units only. For measurements taken with a scale, verify the scale's readability, maximum capacity, calibration status, and traceability to national standards (e.g., NIST)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I prefer grams over milligrams?",
        "answer": "Use grams for larger masses where milligram precision is unnecessary. Use milligrams when you need finer resolution (for example, pharmaceutical dosing or analytical chemistry). Choose the unit that matches instrument readability and reporting rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this handle very large or very small numbers?",
        "answer": "Yes, mathematically it can convert any finite numeric value. For practical use, ensure your numeric input and the target system support the required range and precision; extremely large values may require scientific notation."
