1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion requires multiple inputs (amount, spot exchange rate, optional transaction fee or margin, and rounding) and produces a single computed output (GBP). The exchange rate is not a fixed mathematical constant, so a formula-based component with inputs is required.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or a form for converters). The form will only appear where allowed (simple_calc requires a form).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
