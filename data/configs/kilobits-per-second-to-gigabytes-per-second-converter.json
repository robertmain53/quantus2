    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates data rates expressed in kilobits per second (kbps) to gigabytes per second (GB/s) using standard SI prefixes and the byte/bit relationship. It assumes decimal SI kilo (1 kb = 1,000 bits) and decimal gigabyte (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes) unless you explicitly select binary-prefixed units elsewhere.",
      "Use this tool for planning, capacity calculations, and reporting where a compact, human-friendly measure of throughput is needed. For metrology-grade or regulatory reporting, consult the linked NIST and federal guidance to confirm unit conventions and measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We start from the definition: 1 kilobit per second = 1,000 bits per second (decimal kilo). Convert bits to bytes using 1 byte = 8 bits, then scale bytes to gigabytes using 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes (decimal gigabyte).",
      "When higher-precision or binary-prefixed quantities (kibibit = 2^10 bits, gibibyte = 2^30 bytes) are required, use an appropriate binary-prefix converter. This converter follows SI/decimal conventions by default to match most networking and carrier specifications."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Stepwise formula: GB/s = (kbps × 1,000 bits/kb) ÷ 8 bits/byte ÷ 1,000,000,000 bytes/GB",
      "Simplified factor: GB/s = kbps × 1.25 × 10^-7 (that is, multiply kbps by 0.000000125)",
      "Reverse check: kbps = GB/s ÷ 1.25 × 10^7"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 — 1 kbps → (1 × 1,000) bits/s = 1,000 bits/s → 125 bytes/s → 125 / 1,000,000,000 = 1.25e-7 GB/s.",
      "Example 2 — 10,000 kbps (10 Mbps) → (10,000 × 1,000) = 10,000,000 bits/s → 1,250,000 bytes/s → 0.00125 GB/s.",
      "Example 3 — 100,000 kbps (100 Mbps) → 0.0125 GB/s."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this converter use decimal (SI) or binary prefixes?",
        "answer": "This converter uses decimal SI prefixes by default: 1 kilobit = 1,000 bits and 1 gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes. Binary-prefixed units (kibibit, mebibyte, gibibyte) use powers of two and are handled by separate binary-prefixed converters. Use the binary-prefixed path if your measurement or equipment specification uses IEC binary prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why divide by 8 when converting bits to bytes?",
        "answer": "There are 8 bits in a byte by definition. To convert a rate expressed in bits per second to bytes per second, divide the bit rate by 8. This is an exact relationship used across computing and telecommunications."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose precision and rounding for reporting?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on the context: for headline capacity numbers two to three significant figures are common; for capacity planning and SLAs use four or more significant digits and record the unit convention (decimal vs binary). When reporting for regulatory or contractual purposes, include measurement method and uncertainty per NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are measurement tools and network probes accurate enough for this conversion?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic conversion is exact given the unit definitions. Measurement accuracy depends on the instrument, sampling interval, and test method. For reliable throughput estimates, use controlled tests, document sampling duration, and consider protocol overhead (headers, retransmissions). Refer to federal testing guidance for formal measurement protocols."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use Gibibytes (GiB) or Kibibits (Kibit) instead?",
        "answer": "Use IEC binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi) when specifications or storage vendors explicitly use powers-of-two definitions. Use SI prefixes (k, M, G) when working with networking equipment, signed carrier rates, or when the documentation states decimal prefixes. Mixing conventions without stating them can produce large reporting errors."
