1. This is an advanced_calc because a practical markup tool needs multiple calculation modes (compute selling price from cost + markup, compute required markup from cost + selling price, and convert between markup % and gross margin %). These are distinct formulas with shared inputs and conditional outputs, so a multi-method advanced calculator is required.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or extra UI/layout/help fields). The config will include only the exact allowed keys for an advanced_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
