1. This is an advanced_calc because users commonly need multiple calculation methods (calculate selling price from cost + markup%, from cost + markup amount, from cost + margin%, or derive markup% from selling price). That requires switching between formulas and conditional variable dependencies rather than a single fixed formula.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or other custom UI/meta fields). The form will be present (allowed for advanced_calc) and only include approved field keys.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
