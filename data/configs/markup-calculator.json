1. This is an "advanced_calc" because the calculator will support multiple, industry-relevant pricing methods (cost-plus markup, target gross margin, and optional tax/VAT handling) with conditional inputs and derived variables (selling price, gross profit, margin), which requires method switching and interdependent calculations.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and may include examples[] or summary[] as flat arrays if helpful).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, or any UI/layout fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
