      "This Markup Calculator helps sellers, retailers, and service providers compute selling price, markup percent, cost recovery, and absolute markup quickly and accurately.",
      "Use one of the calculation modes to: (1) compute selling price from cost + markup percentage, (2) compute markup percentage from cost + selling price, or (3) recover cost from selling price + markup percentage. All formulas follow standard business accounting definitions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Markup is calculated relative to cost: Selling price = Cost × (1 + Markup%). This calculator uses that industry-standard formula and expresses markup percent as (Markup amount / Cost) × 100.",
      "When reversing calculations, algebraic rearrangement is used: Cost = Selling price ÷ (1 + Markup%). Intermediate values (absolute markup) are included to aid reconciliation and audits.",
      "These approaches match guidance used in small business pricing resources and microeconomics teaching materials from major academic and government sources. For sales-tax and compliance considerations consult relevant government guidance."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 — Compute selling price: Cost = 50, Markup% = 40 → Selling price = 50 × (1 + 0.40) = 70. Markup amount = 20.",
      "Example 2 — Compute markup%: Cost = 30, Selling price = 45 → Markup amount = 15, Markup% = (15 / 30) × 100 = 50.",
      "Example 3 — Recover cost: Selling price = 200, Markup% = 60 → Cost = 200 ÷ 1.6 = 125, Markup amount = 75."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between markup and gross margin?",
        "answer": "Markup is the percentage added to cost to form the selling price (Markup% = Markup amount / Cost × 100). Gross margin (often expressed as a percent of selling price) is Markup amount divided by Selling price. Confusing them causes pricing errors; use this tool for markup calculations and a margin calculator to convert between the two."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include taxes or fees in cost or selling price?",
        "answer": "Treat taxes (sales tax, VAT) and external fees as separate line items. Markup calculations typically use pre-tax selling price and your true product cost (including landed cost, duties, and internal overhead allocated to the unit) for accurate margin decisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for catalog or POS pricing?",
        "answer": "Round to a business-appropriate precision (typically cents for retail). After rounding, re-check effective markup% and margin to ensure the rounded price still meets profitability targets."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use very large or very small markup percentages?",
        "answer": "Yes, but be cautious: extremely high markup percentages can indicate pricing that exceeds market tolerance; extremely low or negative values imply loss-leading or discounted pricing. Validate with market research and internal profitability thresholds."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these formulas for regulatory reporting or bids?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses exact algebraic formulas; however, when preparing regulatory submissions or formal bids, include supporting documentation (cost breakdowns, overhead allocation methodology) and follow any sector-specific reporting rules or government procurement requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I learn recommended pricing practices and compliance guidance?",
        "answer": "Consult small business pricing resources and government guidance for tax and sales compliance. For formal standards on measurement and reporting, refer to official publications from recognized institutions and government agencies."
