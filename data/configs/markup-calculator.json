1. This is an advanced_calc because torque can be computed by multiple distinct methods (force × lever arm, power & RPM, bolt preload with a K‑factor, hinge/door moment) and users will need to switch between those formulas and inputs.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or any form for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
