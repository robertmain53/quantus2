    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates European-style fuel consumption (litres per 100 kilometres) into miles per imperial gallon (UK mpg). The result is useful for drivers, fleet managers, and technical reports that must compare metric consumption figures with UK imperial mpg ratings.",
      "Calculations use the exact international mile (1 mile = 1.609344 km) and the defined imperial gallon (1 imperial gallon = 4.54609 L). These constants are the basis for the conversion factors used by national measurement authorities and transportation agencies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Start from the input L/100 km (litres consumed over 100 kilometres). Convert litres per 100 km to miles per imperial gallon by: 1) converting kilometres to miles using 1 mile = 1.609344 km, 2) converting litres to imperial gallons using 1 imp gal = 4.54609 L, and 3) forming the miles-per-gallon reciprocal of litres-per-distance.",
      "The numeric constant used for direct conversion (mpg imperial = K / (L/100 km)) is derived from the product of (100 km × miles per km) and imperial gallons per litre. Using the exact definitions above yields the commonly used factor approximately equal to 282.480936.",
      "Displayed results are rounded for readability; see the FAQs for guidance on precision, instrument error, and regulatory reporting."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: L_per_100km → litres consumed per kilometre = L_per_100km / 100.",
      "Step 2: Convert kilometres to miles: 1 km = 0.62137119223733 miles (exact reciprocal of 1.609344).",
      "Step 3: Miles per litre = (miles per km) / (litres per km) = 0.62137119223733 / (L_per_100km / 100).",
      "Step 4: Convert litres to imperial gallons: 1 imperial gallon = 4.54609 L, so multiply miles per litre by 4.54609.",
      "Compact formula: mpg (imperial) ≈ 282.480936 ÷ (L/100 km). Example: 5.0 L/100 km → 282.480936 / 5.0 ≈ 56.50 mpg (UK)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 — City car: 6.5 L/100 km → mpg (UK) ≈ 282.480936 ÷ 6.5 ≈ 43.46 mpg (UK).",
      "Example 2 — Efficient diesel: 4.0 L/100 km → mpg (UK) ≈ 282.480936 ÷ 4.0 ≈ 70.62 mpg (UK).",
      "Example 3 — Combined cycle: 8.0 L/100 km → mpg (UK) ≈ 282.480936 ÷ 8.0 ≈ 35.31 mpg (UK)."

    "summary": [
      "Use this tool to convert L/100 km to miles per imperial gallon using established unit definitions. The single-step conversion uses an exact constants-based factor for reproducible, authoritative results.",
      "For reporting or legal purposes, cross-check rounding rules and measurement uncertainty with your local measurement authority or the documentation of the measuring instrument."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does the converter use 282.480936 as the factor?",
        "answer": "That factor is the result of combining exact definitions: 1 mile = 1.609344 km and 1 imperial gallon = 4.54609 L, then adjusting for the 'per 100 km' denominator. It produces mpg (imperial) when divided into the L/100 km value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust for real-world measurements?",
        "answer": "Instrument and fuel-dispensing tolerances typically limit practical precision. For everyday use, rounding to one or two decimal places is reasonable. For certification or laboratory work, follow the uncertainty and rounding rules of the relevant standard or regulator."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is UK mpg different from US mpg?",
        "answer": "Yes. UK (imperial) gallons are larger (4.54609 L) than US gallons (3.785411784 L), so UK mpg values are numerically higher for the same consumption. Use this converter specifically for imperial (UK) mpg."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for legal or compliance reporting?",
        "answer": "This tool provides a deterministic unit conversion. For formal reporting, confirm rounding rules, measurement uncertainty, and required reference standards with the regulatory body or laboratory accreditation relevant to your jurisdiction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my input is outside typical vehicle ranges (very low or very high L/100 km)?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion still applies for any positive numeric input, but extremely low or high values may indicate incorrect data entry or a measurement error. Verify raw measurements before relying on the converted figure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do the conversion constants come from?",
        "answer": "The constants come from internationally recognized definitions and national metrology institutions. For the mile-to-kilometre relationship and volume definitions, see the citations below from national measurement authorities and transportation agencies."
