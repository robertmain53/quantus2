    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts area values from square feet (ft²) to square millimeters (mm²) using internationally accepted definitions. The conversion is exact based on the defined relationship between the foot and the metre and the metric prefixes for milli-.",
      "For engineering, regulatory, or procurement work where traceability matters, the tool uses the internationally agreed value 1 foot = 0.3048 metre exactly. From that definition the area factor is derived and presented with guidance on significant figures and rounding.",
      "Use this converter for quick, accurate unit changes, or consult the methodology below if you require the derivation, significant-figure guidance, or recommendations for instrument calibration and reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Start from the legal/international definition: 1 foot = 0.3048 metre exactly. Square both sides to convert linear to area units.",
      "Convert square metres to square millimetres using metric prefixes: 1 metre = 1000 millimetres, therefore 1 m² = 1,000,000 mm².",
      "Combine the two steps to produce the exact area conversion factor and present results with recommended significant-figure rules for measurement or documentation contexts."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: 1 ft = 0.3048 m (exact by international agreement).",
      "Step 2: Square both sides: 1 ft² = (0.3048 m)² = 0.09290304 m².",
      "Step 3: Convert m² to mm²: 0.09290304 m² × 1,000,000 mm²/m² = 92,903.04 mm². Therefore 1 ft² = 92,903.04 mm²."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1.0 ft² = 92,903.04 mm².",
      "Example 2: 10 ft² = 929,030.4 mm².",
      "Example 3: 0.5 ft² = 46,451.52 mm²."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Exact derivation uses the international definition of the foot and metric scaling: 1 ft² = 92,903.04 mm².",
      "Report converted values with the same number of significant figures as the input measurement, and consider instrument calibration and uncertainty when precision matters."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from square feet to square millimetres?",
        "answer": "1 square foot equals 92,903.04 square millimetres. This comes from 1 ft = 0.3048 m exactly, squaring that to get 0.09290304 m², then converting m² to mm² (1 m² = 1,000,000 mm²)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round the result, and how many significant figures should I keep?",
        "answer": "Round results to reflect the precision of your input measurement and instrument. If the input is given to three significant figures, report the converted value to three significant figures and include uncertainty if required by your workflow or regulatory reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the conversion introduce measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion itself is exact given the defined constants. Measurement uncertainty arises from how the original area was measured (tape accuracy, digital sensor resolution, calibration). Apply uncertainty propagation rules and cite instrument calibration certificates when reporting results for compliance or engineering purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does this converter use 0.3048 metres for a foot?",
        "answer": "The value 1 ft = 0.3048 m is the internationally agreed definition used by NIST and ISO to ensure consistency between customary and SI units. Using the exact definition produces a precise, traceable conversion factor for area."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report very large or very small converted values?",
        "answer": "For readability and to avoid loss of precision, use scientific notation for extremely large or small numbers and include the number of significant figures and, where applicable, measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Any recommendations for instrument calibration and traceability?",
        "answer": "For regulated work, ensure instruments are calibrated against standards traceable to national metrology institutes (for example, NIST in the United States) and retain calibration certificates. Document measurement method, environmental conditions, and uncertainty estimates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these unit definitions accepted internationally?",
        "answer": "Yes. The definitions used here follow international standards and guidance from national metrology institutes and the ISO standards family for quantities and units."
