    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms any terabyte (TB) value into gigabytes (GB) following the SI decimal convention used by drive manufacturers, cloud providers, and billing dashboards.",
      "Because 1 terabyte equals 1,000 gigabytes in decimal notation, the conversion is a single multiplication by 1,000. Use it to reconcile capacity specs, transfer quotas, and archive planning."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Use the decimal SI definition: 1 TB = 1,000 GB. The converter multiplies the TB input by 1,000 to return GB.",
      "If a workload expects binary units (TiB/GiB), apply 1 TiB = 1,024 GiB. This tool surfaces the decimal baseline; binary guidance is noted for completeness."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "GB = TB × 1,000 (decimal SI convention).",
      "For binary contexts: GiB = (TB × 1,000,000,000,000 bytes) ÷ 1,073,741,824."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 TB → 1,000 GB",
      "2.5 TB → 2,500 GB",
      "10 TB → 10,000 GB"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does my OS show less than the drive label?",
        "answer": "Drive labels use decimal (TB, GB) while many operating systems display binary (TiB, GiB). A 1 TB drive (1,000 GB) appears as about 931 GiB because the OS divides by 1,073,741,824 bytes per GiB."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I plan capacity in TB or TiB?",
        "answer": "For procurement and vendor specs, TB is standard. For system sizing where the OS reports GiB/TiB, convert with binary factors to align with what the platform shows."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is overhead considered in this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. This is a pure unit conversion. Filesystem metadata, RAID, snapshots, and protocol overhead reduce usable capacity."
