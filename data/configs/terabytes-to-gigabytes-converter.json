    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms data storage measurements from Terabytes to Gigabytes, enabling practical storage capacity understanding.",
      "Modern storage devices are specified in terabytes while file sizes are typically gigabytes. Understanding the conversion is essential.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 terabyte equals exactly 1,000 gigabytes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 TB = 1,000 GB. To convert terabytes to gigabytes, multiply by 1,000. For example, 1 TB = 1,000 GB, 5 TB = 5,000 GB.",
      "Hard drives and SSDs are marketed in terabytes while individual files and folders are measured in gigabytes.",
      "Cloud storage quotas are often expressed in terabytes for enterprise plans, gigabytes for consumer plans.",
      "This converter provides precise storage size conversions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Hard drive: A 2 TB drive contains 2,000 GB of storage.",
      "Example 2 – SSD: A 4 TB SSD holds 4,000 GB or approximately 4,000 video files at 1 GB each.",
      "Example 3 – Cloud backup: A 10 TB cloud subscription provides 10,000 GB of backup capacity."

        "question": "How many gigabytes do I need?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How much data can I store?",
        "answer": "1 TB = 1,000 GB = 1,000,000 MB = approximately 250 movies or 500,000 photos."
