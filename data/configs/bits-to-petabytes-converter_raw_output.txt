1. This is a converter because the task is a direct unit-to-unit conversion (Bytes → AttoBytes) with a fixed mathematical relationship and a single input producing a single output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" for that exact reason.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown or HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, form for converters, or any other disallowed properties).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
