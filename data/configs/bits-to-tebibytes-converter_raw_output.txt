1. This is a converter because converting Bytes to AttoBytes is a fixed unit-to-unit conversion with a single numeric input producing a single output (no additional variables or conditional methods required).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, or other disallowed keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
