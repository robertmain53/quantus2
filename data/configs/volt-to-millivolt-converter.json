    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms electrical voltage measurements from Volts (SI standard) to Millivolts (convenient for low-voltage applications), enabling precise voltage calculations in electronics and sensor systems. It is designed for electrical engineers, electronics technicians, instrument specialists, and instrumentation professionals.",
      "The Volt is the SI unit of electrical voltage or potential difference, representing energy per unit charge. The Millivolt is 0.001 volts, commonly used in analog electronics, sensor interfaces, and precision measurement systems where low voltages are typical. Understanding voltage conversion is essential for electronics engineering and signal conditioning.",
      "This converter uses the exact relationship where 1 Volt equals 1,000 Millivolts, enabling precise voltage conversions for analog circuits, sensor interface design, data acquisition systems, and signal processing across diverse electronic applications."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The relationship between Volts and Millivolts is straightforward: 1 Volt = 1,000 Millivolts. This reflects the SI metric prefix where 'milli' means 0.001. This converter uses the exact conversion factor: 1 V = 1,000 mV.",
      "To convert Volts to Millivolts, multiply the voltage in Volts by 1,000. For example, 1 V = 1,000 mV, 5 V = 5,000 mV, 0.001 V = 1 mV. This conversion is essential when working with sensor outputs and analog signal conditioning circuits.",
      "Sensor outputs typically range from millivolts to tens of millivolts. For example, thermocouples produce millivolt-level signals, analog pressure sensors output signals in the 0-100 mV range, and precision strain gauges output microvolts to millivolts. Converting to Volts or Millivolts depends on the application context.",
      "This converter provides precise voltage conversions for analog electronics design, sensor interface implementation, data acquisition programming, and precision measurement system development. Use accurate voltage values for amplifier gain selection, ADC configuration, and signal integrity verification in electronic systems."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Thermocouple: A Type K thermocouple generates approximately 41 mV per 1000°C, essential for temperature measurement system design.",
      "Example 2 – Pressure sensor: A 4-20 mA pressure transmitter with 250Ω shunt produces 1-5 V output (1000-5000 mV), used in industrial monitoring.",
      "Example 3 – Microphone input: Audio line-level signals are typically around 0.5 V (500 mV), while microphone outputs are 5-20 mV, requiring preamplification.",
      "Example 4 – Battery measurement: A 1.5 V AA battery measured with precision shows 1,500 mV, used for battery monitoring and management systems."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion factor from Volt to Millivolt?",
        "answer": "The conversion is exact: 1 Volt = 1,000 Millivolts. This relationship is based on SI metric definitions where 'milli' means 0.001, making the ratio 1,000:1."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use Millivolts instead of Volts?",
        "answer": "Use Millivolts for low-voltage signals like sensor outputs, audio signals, and precision measurements where decimal Volts would be awkward. Millivolts provide more convenient numbers for electronic design."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a typical voltage range for sensors?",
        "answer": "Most sensors output 0-10 mV (pressure, temperature, strain), 4-20 mA through a load resistor (industrial), 0-5 V (standard analog), or 0-3.3 V (modern digital systems). Signal conditioning circuits often convert these to appropriate ranges."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I select an amplifier for a millivolt signal?",
        "answer": "Calculate required gain: Gain = (Desired Output Voltage) / (Input Voltage). For a 50 mV input to 5 V output, Gain = 5 / 0.050 = 100. Select an operational amplifier with sufficient gain and bandwidth for your application."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is resolution in a data acquisition system?",
        "answer": "Resolution = Full-Scale Range / Number of Bits. A 12-bit ADC with 0-5 V input has resolution of 5 / 4096 ≈ 1.22 mV per count. Higher resolution requires lower noise and better signal conditioning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does noise affect analog measurements?",
        "answer": "Electronic noise adds uncertainty to voltage measurements. Systems handling millivolt signals must carefully shield and filter to avoid noise corruption. Professional measurement systems use differential inputs to reject common-mode noise."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between AC and DC voltage?",
        "answer": "DC voltage is constant with time; AC voltage oscillates sinusoidally. Most sensors provide DC outputs; AC voltage is used for power transmission. Both can be measured in Volts or Millivolts depending on the magnitude."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prevent signal aliasing in data acquisition?",
        "answer": "Sample at least twice the highest frequency in the signal (Nyquist theorem). Use an anti-aliasing low-pass filter before the ADC. For example, measuring 10 kHz signals requires 20 kHz minimum sampling with appropriate filtering."
