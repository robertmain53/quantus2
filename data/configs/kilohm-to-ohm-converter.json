    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms resistance measurements from Kilohms to Ohms for detailed circuit analysis and component selection. Essential for electrical engineers and circuit technicians.",
      "Kilohms provide convenient notation for typical circuit resistances, while ohms are needed for precise calculations. This conversion is fundamental to circuit design.",
      "This converter enables precise resistance conversions for circuit analysis and component sourcing."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 kΩ = 1,000 Ω. To convert kΩ to Ω, multiply by 1,000. For example, 1 kΩ = 1,000 Ω, 10 kΩ = 10,000 Ω, 100 kΩ = 100,000 Ω.",
      "Circuit calculations often require resistances in ohms. Converting from kilohms ensures proper current and power calculations.",
      "Precision circuits require exact resistance values for accurate gain setting and signal conditioning. Accurate conversions prevent design errors.",
      "This converter provides precise resistance conversions for circuit design, signal processing system development, and electronics documentation."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Gain setting: A 10 kΩ (10,000 Ω) feedback resistor sets amplifier gain.",
      "Example 2 – Biasing: A 47 kΩ (47,000 Ω) base bias resistor provides proper transistor biasing.",
      "Example 3 – Impedance matching: A 50 kΩ (50,000 Ω) input impedance specification.",
      "Example 4 – Filter design: A 100 kΩ (100,000 Ω) resistor in RC filter network."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from kΩ to Ω?",
        "answer": "1 kΩ = 1,000 Ω. Multiply kilohms by 1,000 to get ohms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate circuit currents from resistance?",
        "answer": "Use Ohm's Law: I = V/R. For 5V across 10 kΩ (10,000 Ω): I = 5/10,000 = 0.5 mA."
      },
      {
        "question": "What resistor values should I use in circuits?",
        "answer": "Use E12 or E24 standard series values. Common: 1 kΩ, 4.7 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 47 kΩ, 100 kΩ. Avoid non-standard values when possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I select precision resistors?",
        "answer": "For circuits where accuracy matters (signal gain, reference), use 1% tolerance metal-film resistors. For standard circuits, 5% is adequate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What causes resistor drift?",
        "answer": "Temperature, aging, humidity, and applied voltage affect resistance over time. High-stability applications use resistors with specified temperature coefficients."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is resistance related to wire gauge?",
        "answer": "Resistance = Resistivity × Length / Area. Thicker wire (lower gauge number) has lower resistance per unit length. Important for power distribution."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is equivalent resistance?",
        "answer": "Series: R_total = R1 + R2 + ... Parallel: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... Choosing series or parallel configuration changes total resistance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test resistor values?",
        "answer": "Use a digital multimeter set to resistance mode. Measure with power off. Compare to specification. Out-of-spec resistors indicate component failure or defects."
