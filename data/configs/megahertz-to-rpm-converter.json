    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a frequency value expressed in megahertz (MHz) into revolutions per minute (RPM). The relationship is purely mathematical: 1 Hz equals one cycle per second, and 1 minute equals 60 seconds, so the conversion follows directly from those SI definitions.",
      "Use this tool when you need to express an electronic or measured frequency as an equivalent rotational speed (for example when an electrical sensor produces one pulse per revolution). For measurement and calibration decisions consult traceable standards and instrument specifications to avoid misinterpretation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed by converting megahertz to hertz (1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz) and then converting hertz to revolutions per minute by multiplying by 60 (1 Hz = 60 RPM). The combined factor is: RPM = MHz × 1,000,000 × 60 = MHz × 60,000,000.",
      "This is an exact arithmetic conversion based on SI unit definitions; any uncertainty arises from how the input frequency was measured, the relationship between electrical cycles and mechanical revolutions (pulses per revolution), and rounding choices.",
      "When converting real measurements, verify whether the frequency reading corresponds to one revolution per cycle. If the sensor produces N pulses per revolution, divide the computed RPM by N. For precision-sensitive applications, use traceable calibration and report measurement uncertainty per NIST/ISO guidance."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert MHz to Hz: Hz = MHz × 1,000,000",
      "Step 2: Convert Hz to RPM: RPM = Hz × 60",
      "Combined formula: RPM = MHz × 1,000,000 × 60 = MHz × 60,000,000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 MHz → RPM = 1 × 60,000,000 = 60,000,000 RPM",
      "Example 2: 2.5 MHz → RPM = 2.5 × 60,000,000 = 150,000,000 RPM",
      "Example 3 (sensor with pulses per rev): If a sensor gives 4 pulses per revolution and measures 0.5 MHz, raw RPM = 0.5 × 60,000,000 = 30,000,000; actual shaft RPM = 30,000,000 ÷ 4 = 7,500,000 RPM"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the MHz → RPM conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The arithmetic conversion between units is exact given the SI definitions: 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz and 1 Hz = 60 RPM. Any deviation in a real application comes from how the input frequency was measured and the mapping between electrical cycles and mechanical revolutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle sensors that emit multiple pulses per revolution?",
        "answer": "If a sensor or encoder emits N pulses per revolution, first convert the measured frequency to RPM using the formula RPM_raw = MHz × 60,000,000, then divide by N to get shaft RPM. Always confirm the device's pulses-per-revolution specification in the manufacturer's datasheet."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate will my converted RPM be?",
        "answer": "The conversion itself is exact; measurement accuracy depends on the instrument (frequency counter, tachometer, oscilloscope) and its calibration. Consider instrument sampling rate, measurement uncertainty, and environmental effects. For traceable accuracy follow calibration and uncertainty guidance from NIST and ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there practical limits or safety concerns with very high RPM values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Extremely large RPM values produced by high frequencies may exceed mechanical design limits of components and test fixtures. Verify mechanical ratings, bearing speeds, and safety interlocks. When interpreting electrical frequencies as mechanical speeds, ensure the physical system is rated for the implied RPM."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about sampling, aliasing, and digital measurement limits?",
        "answer": "Digital sampling instruments must satisfy the Nyquist criterion (sample rate greater than 2× the measured frequency) to avoid aliasing. Many counters and DAQ systems have upper frequency limits—check the device maximum input frequency, front-end conditioning, and required anti-aliasing filters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find standards and calibration guidance for traceability?",
        "answer": "For SI unit definitions and best practices consult NIST guidance and SI documentation. For calibration intervals and accredited procedures, follow ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab recommendations and your instrument manufacturer's calibration advice."
