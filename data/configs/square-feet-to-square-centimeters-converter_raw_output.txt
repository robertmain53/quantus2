1. This is a converter because it converts a single numeric value between two area units (square feet ↔ square meters) with a fixed mathematical relationship and requires one input and one output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, layout, ui, or other extraneous keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
