      "This calculator provides an estimate of inheritance or estate tax under common UK and US federal scenarios. It shows intermediate values (net estate, taxable amount) so you can see how exemptions and deductions affect the result.",
      "The tool is an estimator only: it uses user-provided inputs and configurable assumptions. It is not a substitute for professional tax advice or official filings."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Each method computes a 'net estate' by subtracting debts, administration costs, allowable exemptions and chargeable lifetime gifts from the gross estate.",
      "The calculator then applies the selected exemptions (for example a nil-rate band or federal exemption) and multiplies the remaining taxable amount by the statutory rate supplied by the method or user.",
      "Where multiple special rules may apply (for example reduced charitable rates, residence nil-rate band, marital deductions), select the method that best matches your situation and review the intermediate values. The tool does not automatically determine eligibility for complex reliefs."

      {
        "question": "What should I enter for exemptions and rates?",
        "answer": "Enter the exemption and rate values that apply for the relevant tax year and jurisdiction. Where statutory amounts change frequently, verify the current thresholds with official sources or your tax advisor before relying on results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should negative taxable values be interpreted?",
        "answer": "If the calculated taxable amount is zero or negative, the estimated tax due is zero. The calculator may display negative intermediate values for transparency; treat those results as indicating no taxable estate under the inputs provided."
