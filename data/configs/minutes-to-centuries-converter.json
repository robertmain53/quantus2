    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a quantity expressed in minutes into centuries. A century is a period of 100 years; the exact number of minutes in 100 years depends on which definition of a year you choose (common 365-day year, Gregorian mean year, Julian year, or astronomical conventions).",
      "The tool provides a single numeric conversion based on the chosen standard definition described below and explains precision, limits, and when alternative definitions are appropriate. It is intended for general-purpose use and for contexts where a fixed-calendar assumption is acceptable."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is a fixed arithmetic operation: convert minutes to days, days to years using a chosen year-length definition, then multiply by 100 to get minutes per century and divide. We present the most common definitions so you can select the one matching your needs.",
      "Recommended practice: document which year-length assumption you use when reporting century-level conversions. For traceability and measurement best practices consult NIST, BIPM/Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, and relevant ISO guidance on quantities and units. For workplace or regulatory timekeeping contexts, consult applicable local standards or agencies.",
      "Accuracy caveats: because calendar years include leap days and because different disciplines use different standard year lengths (365, 365.25, 365.2425, astronomical definitions), results may differ by tens of thousands of minutes per century. For high-precision or legal uses, specify the exact definition and number of significant digits."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic steps: minutes to days (divide by 1440), days to years (divide by chosen days-per-year), centuries = years divided by 100.",
      "Common predefined minute-per-century values (used as denominators when converting minutes to centuries):",
      " - Common 365-day year: 1 century = 100 x 365 x 24 x 60 = 52,560,000 minutes.",
      " - Julian year (365.25 days): 1 century = 100 x 365.25 x 24 x 60 = 52,596,000 minutes.",
      " - Gregorian mean year (365.2425 days): 1 century = 100 x 365.2425 x 24 x 60 = 52,594,920 minutes.",
      "To convert minutes to centuries: centuries = minutes ÷ (minutes per century using chosen year definition)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example using 365-day year: 1,000,000 minutes ÷ 52,560,000 = 0.019011 (centuries).",
      "Example using Gregorian mean year (365.2425 days): 1,000,000 minutes ÷ 52,594,920 ≈ 0.019006 (centuries).",
      "Example showing scale: 52,560,000 minutes = 1 century (by 365-day definition)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "A minutes-to-centuries conversion is a simple division, but results depend on the year-length assumption. Use the definition that matches your discipline and state it when precision matters.",
      "For most everyday calculations the 365-day or Gregorian mean-year definitions are sufficient; for astronomical or long-term historical work use the convention preferred in that field."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which year definition should I pick for converting minutes to centuries?",
        "answer": "Pick the definition that matches your use case. Use 365 days for rough estimates, 365.2425 (Gregorian mean) for civil-average conversions, and 365.25 (Julian) for some astronomical conventions. Always state your assumption when publishing results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many minutes are in one century?",
        "answer": "It depends. Common values: 52,560,000 (100 × 365 days), 52,596,000 (100 × 365.25 days), 52,594,920 (100 × 365.2425 days). Specify which you mean."
      },
      {
        "question": "What level of precision can I trust?",
        "answer": "For conversions based on fixed arithmetic, numeric precision is limited by your input precision and the chosen year definition. Rounding should reflect meaningful significant figures for your context. For legal, scientific, or regulatory use verify the required precision with the applicable authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards references for unit conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. Measurement and unit definitions are maintained by recognized bodies such as national measurement institutes and international standards organizations. Consult these authorities for traceability and best practices; see the citations below."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for leap seconds or calendar reform?",
        "answer": "No. This converter applies fixed arithmetic based on day/year lengths. Leap seconds and historical calendar reforms are out of scope; they require specialized timekeeping tools and authoritative time scales (e.g., UTC) maintained by metrology agencies."
