    "introduction": [
      "Convert area measured in square metres (m²) to hectares (ha) using the internationally accepted relationship that 1 hectare equals 10,000 square metres.",
      "This converter is intended for quick unit conversions used in planning, reporting, land management and engineering. For legal or cadastral surveys use certified survey data and follow local regulatory rounding rules."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a fixed ratio based on the definition of a hectare: 1 ha = 10,000 m². This is an internationally standardized relationship used by measurement authorities including national metrology institutes and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).",
      "For display and reporting we recommend choosing a precision that matches your use case: coarse planning (two significant figures), engineering (three to four significant figures), and legal/cadastral (follow the precision required by your land registry or surveyor)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: hectares = square metres ÷ 10,000",
      "Example: 2,500 m² → 2,500 ÷ 10,000 = 0.25 ha",
      "For reverse conversion: square metres = hectares × 10,000"
    ],

      "100 m² = 0.01 ha",
      "1,000 m² = 0.1 ha",

      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between square metres and hectares?",
        "answer": "Exactly 1 hectare equals 10,000 square metres. This is a defined unit relationship used by international measurement authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose precision by use case: planning/estimates 2 decimal places, engineering/design 3–4 decimal places, and legal/cadastral follow your jurisdiction or surveyor requirements. When in doubt, keep raw values and document rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a hectare an SI unit?",
        "answer": "The hectare is a non-SI metric unit accepted for use with the SI. The SI base unit for area is the square metre; the hectare is defined as 10,000 square metres and is widely used in land measurement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this converter for legal land transfers or cadastral records?",
        "answer": "This tool provides unit conversions only and is not a substitute for a certified survey. For legal transactions rely on certified survey measurements, official cadastral records, and the rounding/measurement conventions required by the relevant land registry or authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does this relate to acres?",
        "answer": "To convert hectares to acres, use the relationship 1 hectare ≈ 2.47105381 acres. That conversion is separate from m²↔ha but can be obtained by chaining conversions: m² → ha → acres, or via published factors from measurement authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about measurement uncertainty from instruments?",
        "answer": "Instrument and survey uncertainty should be tracked and reported separately from unit conversion. When converting reported measurements, do not imply better precision than the original instrument or survey permits—propagate uncertainty and round accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references for these definitions?",
        "answer": "Authoritative definitions and unit relationships are published by international and national metrology organizations and by land and agricultural agencies; refer to sources such as BIPM and NIST for definitions and guidance."
