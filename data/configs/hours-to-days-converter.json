      "This converter transforms time measurements from Hours to Days, enabling schedule understanding.",
      "Hours are precise for detailed tracking, but days are used for project duration and milestones.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 day equals exactly 24 hours."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 day = 24 hours. To convert hours to days, divide by 24. For example, 24 hours = 1 day, 48 hours = 2 days, 72 hours = 3 days.",
      "Project duration is often expressed in working days while detailed work is tracked in hours.",
      "Understanding time conversion helps with accurate project estimation and resource allocation.",
      "This converter provides precise time conversions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Work: 160 hours of work is 20 working days (8 hours/day).",
      "Example 2 – Duration: 48 hours is 2 calendar days.",
      "Example 3 – Workweek: 40 hours is 5 working days."

      {
        "question": "How many working days in hours?",
        "answer": "Typically 40 hours = 5 working days (8 hours per day)."

        "question": "How do I convert hours to weeks?",
        "answer": "Divide hours by 168 (24 × 7) to get weeks."
