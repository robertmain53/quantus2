    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a numeric quantity expressed in hours into days using the fixed mathematical relationship where one day equals 24 hours. The tool provides a precise decimal result and guidance for expressing results as whole days plus remaining hours when needed.",
      "The calculation is purely mathematical and does not account for calendar irregularities, daylight saving time shifts, or leap seconds. For timekeeping, legal working hours, or scientific measurement concerns consult the referenced standards and regulatory guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the exact, fixed ratio 1 day = 24 hours. This is the standard civil convention for converting hours to calendar days and is suitable for scheduling, planning, payroll estimation, and general arithmetic conversions.",
      "When higher precision is required for scientific timekeeping, reference coordinated time standards and leap-second adjustments maintained by international bodies. For occupational limits and legal definitions of working days or hours consult relevant workplace regulations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: days = hours ÷ 24",
      "To express remainder as hours: whole_days = floor(hours ÷ 24); remaining_hours = hours - (whole_days × 24)",
      "Rounding guidance: present decimal days to a sensible number of decimal places based on context (e.g., 2–4 decimal places for scheduling; more for scientific reporting)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "50 hours → 50 ÷ 24 = 2.083333... → 2.0833 days (or 2 days and 2 hours)",
      "8 hours → 8 ÷ 24 = 0.333333... → 0.3333 days (or 0 days and 8 hours)",
      "240 hours → 240 ÷ 24 = 10 days exactly"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is one day always exactly 24 hours for this conversion?",
        "answer": "For this converter, yes: a day is taken as exactly 24 hours. This is the standard civil conversion used for planning and arithmetic. It does not reflect astronomical variations, leap seconds, or sidereal day length."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Choose rounding based on use case. For general scheduling, 2–4 decimal places is usually sufficient. For payroll or legal calculations, follow the rounding and truncation rules required by your employer or jurisdiction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for daylight saving time or leap seconds?",
        "answer": "No. Daylight saving time shifts and leap seconds are not accounted for. Those are adjustments in civil or atomic timekeeping and require referencing time zone databases or international time standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert working hours into working days for labor rules?",
        "answer": "You can convert hours to calendar days arithmetically, but legal definitions of a workday or permitted working hours depend on local labor laws and regulations. Consult regulatory guidance for compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about fractional days displayed as hours and minutes?",
        "answer": "After computing decimal days, convert the fractional part back to hours and minutes by multiplying by 24. For example, fractional days × 24 gives remaining hours; fractional hours × 60 gives minutes."
