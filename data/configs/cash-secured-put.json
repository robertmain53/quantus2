      "This calculator provides practical, trade-level metrics for cash-secured put positions: required cash reserve, net credit, break-even price, maximum potential loss, and both period and approximate annualized returns. It also includes a simplified illustrative scenario for rolling a subset of contracts out and down.",
      "The tool is designed for decision support and scenario exploration. It does not replace brokerage execution platforms, legal advice, or tax guidance. Results are illustrative and rely on inputs provided by the user."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations follow straightforward arithmetic: premiums are per-share and multiplied by contract size (100 shares per contract). Cash required equals strike price × contracts × 100. Net credit subtracts estimated commissions. Annualized return is an approximation using linear scaling (return × 365 / days_to_expiry).",
      "Model and user-interface design follow recognized practices for reliability and traceability. For secure handling of inputs, storage, and integration, follow NIST guidance on data integrity and ISO/IEC best practices for information security. Accuracy and safety disclaimers reference IEEE guidelines for algorithmic transparency and OSHA recommendations for operational controls where applicable."

      "Example: Sell 1 put at 95 strike, receive $2.50 premium, 30 days to expiry. Cash required = $9,500. Total premium = $250. Net credit (after $0.65 commission) = $249.35 (illustrative). Return on cash ≈ 2.62% for the period, annualized ≈ 31.8% (approx.).",
      "Rolling example (illustrative): If rolling 1 contract from strike 95 to new strike 90, collect a different premium for the new strike, and pay estimated closing and opening commissions, the net change in credit and new cash reserve are shown. This is a simplified model and does not replicate live fill prices or slippage."

      {
        "question": "What does 'cash-secured' mean?",
        "answer": "Cash-secured means you reserve the full cash amount needed to buy the underlying at the strike if assigned. The calculator computes that reserved amount as strike × contracts × 100."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are commissions, fees, and taxes included?",
        "answer": "The calculator deducts a user-specified commission per contract as an estimate. It provides a field for a tax rate for user reference but does not compute detailed tax liability. Users should consult tax professionals for precise tax treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the annualized returns?",
        "answer": "Annualized returns use a linear scaling approximation (return × 365 / days). This ignores path dependency, reinvestment, and timing effects. Use annualized results for rough comparison only; do not treat them as guaranteed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for trade execution?",
        "answer": "No. This tool is for scenarios and planning. Execution depends on live market prices, fills, margin rules, and broker-specific requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards support the calculator's trust assertions?",
        "answer": "Design, data handling, and transparency recommendations referenced include NIST frameworks for data integrity, ISO/IEC information security guidance, IEEE recommendations for algorithmic transparency, and OSHA guidance for operational safety oversight where human procedures are concerned."
