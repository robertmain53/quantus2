    "introduction": [
      "This advanced early-retirement planner estimates when you could retire given your current savings, contributions, assumed returns, inflation, and a chosen withdrawal strategy. It supports multiple methods so you can compare a FIRE-style target, a static safe-withdrawal projection, a simple dynamic indicator, and a target-income calculation.",
      "The tool is intended for planning and scenario comparison. It provides deterministic estimates based on the inputs and does not simulate sequence-of-returns scenarios or tax, health, or policy changes. Use conservative assumptions and consult a licensed financial professional for personalized advice."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator projects nominal portfolio growth to the planned retirement year using geometric compounding and a standard future value of an annuity formula for contributions. Spending estimates are inflated to the retirement start year using your inflation assumption.",
      "Multiple methods are provided: a target-portfolio approach (spending × 1/withdrawal rate), a static withdrawal estimate applying a single withdrawal rate to the projected balance, a heuristic dynamic indicator that divides projected balance by inflated spending to estimate years supported, and a target-income calculation solving required portfolio from desired retirement income.",
      "Accuracy and data handling guidance in this tool follows secure handling and software reliability practices recommended by standards bodies. See citations for links to recognized standards and authoritative sources. This tool is not investment advice."

      "Years to retirement = planned_retirement_age − current_age",

      "Example: Age 35, retire at 55, $100k savings, $15k/year contributions, 6% pre-retirement return, 2% inflation, 4% withdrawal rate. The planner projects the portfolio at 55 and shows how it compares to the target portfolio needed to fund inflation-adjusted spending.",

        "question": "What is a safe withdrawal rate?",
