    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts frequency values from kilohertz (kHz) to gigahertz (GHz) using the International System of Units (SI) relationship between prefixes. It is intended for engineers, technicians, students, and anyone working with radio, signal processing, or measurement data who needs an exact, repeatable unit conversion.",
      "Conversions are exact mathematically (based on powers of ten). Practical considerations such as measurement instrument resolution, calibration interval, and rounding policy affect how many digits you keep when reporting results. The guidance below cites recognized standards and measurement authorities."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion follows SI prefix rules: kilo- denotes 10^3 and giga- denotes 10^9. Converting between kHz and GHz is therefore a power-of-ten scaling with no empirical or device-dependent factors.",
      "When reporting converted values for experimental or regulatory use, round to a number of significant figures consistent with the instrument’s uncertainty. For traceable measurements consult calibration certificates and national measurement institutes such as NIST or the BIPM for SI guidance.",
      "For batch or CSV conversions, ensure numeric parsing preserves magnitude (watch for commas, locale decimal separators, and scientific notation). For signals close to instrument limits, include a note about sample rate, resolution bandwidth, and measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Understand prefixes — 1 kHz = 10^3 Hz, 1 GHz = 10^9 Hz.",
      "Step 2: Convert units by aligning to Hz then rescaling: GHz = kHz × 10^(-6).",
      "Concise formula: GHz = kHz / 1,000,000 (equivalently GHz = kHz × 1e-6)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 kHz → 500 × 10^-6 = 0.0005 GHz",
      "1,000,000 kHz → 1,000,000 × 10^-6 = 1 GHz",
      "2450000 kHz → 2450000 × 10^-6 = 2.45 GHz"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between kHz and GHz?",
        "answer": "1 kHz = 10^-6 GHz, so to convert kHz to GHz multiply by 1×10^-6 or divide by 1,000,000. This is an exact SI-prefix relationship."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the measurement uncertainty of your instrument. For laboratory-grade spectrum analyzers, 3–6 significant figures are common; for system-level specs, 2–3 may suffice. Always follow your project or regulatory reporting rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert a value in scientific notation?",
        "answer": "Apply the same factor: for example, 3.2e5 kHz × 1e-6 = 3.2e-1 GHz (0.32 GHz). Preserve exponent arithmetic to avoid rounding errors during intermediate steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any instrument or measurement limits to watch for?",
        "answer": "Yes. Measurement devices have finite resolution and bandwidth (e.g., sample rate, span, resolution bandwidth). If the converted frequency approaches device limits, include the instrument’s stated uncertainty and calibration status in reports. Refer to your instrument manual and calibration certificate for traceability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for Doppler shift, dispersion, or medium effects?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs only unit scaling between kHz and GHz. Physical effects like Doppler shift or propagation-related dispersion must be calculated separately using appropriate formulas and measurement data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert many values at once or import CSV?",
        "answer": "This converter supports single-value conversion. For batch conversions, export your data as plain numeric values (avoid embedded units or thousand separators), then apply the same 1e-6 factor programmatically in a spreadsheet or script."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I cite standards when reporting converted values?",
        "answer": "Cite the International System of Units (SI) and your measurement traceability path. For formal reports reference authoritative bodies such as NIST or BIPM and include calibration certificate IDs for instruments used."
