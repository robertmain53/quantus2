    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length value expressed in metres to kilometres using the fixed mathematical relationship between these SI units. It is intended for quick, unambiguous unit conversion for engineering, planning, and reporting tasks.",
      "Results are presented as a straightforward numeric conversion. Guidance on rounding, significant figures, measurement uncertainty, and relevant standards is provided so you can use the output confidently in documentation or calculations that require traceability."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) definition where 1 kilometre equals 1 000 metres. The calculation is therefore deterministic and lossless in mathematical terms; any real-world inaccuracy arises from measurement error or numeric rounding.",
      "Recommendations for reporting follow best practices from standards bodies. Use appropriate significant figures based on measurement instrument resolution and document any measurement uncertainty per guidance from NIST, ISO, and the internationally recognized Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Fundamental relationship: 1 kilometre = 1 000 metres.",
      "Conversion step: divide the value in metres by 1000 to obtain kilometres.",
      "Formula: kilometres = metres ÷ 1000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1500 metres → 1500 ÷ 1000 = 1.5 kilometres.",
      "Example 2: 0.75 metres → 0.75 ÷ 1000 = 0.00075 kilometres."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many metres are in one kilometre?",
        "answer": "One kilometre equals one thousand metres (1 km = 1 000 m)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the converted value?",
        "answer": "Round according to the precision of your input measurement and reporting requirements. If your metre measurement is exact to the nearest metre, report kilometres to three decimal places (for example, 1234 m → 1.234 km). For instrument-derived measurements, include uncertainty and significant figures per accepted practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative values or very large numbers?",
        "answer": "Yes. Negative values convert normally (they indicate direction or signed displacement). Very large or very small numbers should be expressed using scientific notation if needed; be mindful of floating-point limits in downstream systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for measurement error?",
        "answer": "No. This conversion performs a mathematical unit change only. To account for measurement error, estimate and report measurement uncertainty separately following GUM and relevant standards from NIST and ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which reporting standards should I follow when publishing converted values?",
        "answer": "Follow SI unit conventions and reporting guidance from NIST and ISO. For uncertainty reporting, follow the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). For industry-specific requirements, consult applicable IEEE or regulatory guidance."
