1. This is a converter because converting megabytes to gigabytes is a fixed unit-to-unit conversion with one input and one output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, or any extra UI/layout fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
