    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a value expressed in bits into petabytes (PB) using the SI decimal definition where 1 PB = 10^15 bytes. It is useful for large-scale capacity planning, data warehousing, and network transfer estimates."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base identity: 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal (SI) prefixes use powers of 10: 1 PB = 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.",
      "Conversion path: bits → bytes (÷8) → petabytes (÷10^15). Combined: PB = bits ÷ (8 × 10^15).",
      "Binary context: if you need pebibytes (PiB), use 1 PiB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes (2^50). The bit-to-byte factor remains ÷8; change the divisor to 1,125,899,906,842,624 for PiB."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula (decimal PB): petabytes = bits ÷ (8 × 1,000,000,000,000,000).",
      "Binary comparison (PiB): pebibytes = bits ÷ (8 × 1,125,899,906,842,624).",
      "Always retain full precision for calculations; round outputs for display as needed."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "8,000,000,000,000,000 bits → 1 PB.",
      "40,000,000,000,000,000 bits → 5 PB.",
      "8,007,379,880,000,000 bits → approximately 0.889 PB; equals about 0.888 PiB in binary terms."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which convention does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "Decimal SI prefixes (1 PB = 10^15 bytes). For binary needs (PiB), use the binary divisor shown in the methodology."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might a storage system show a different number?",
        "answer": "Many systems report in binary units (PiB) or mix binary units but label them with decimal symbols. The underlying byte count is the same; the difference is the divisor (10^15 vs 2^50)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round large values?",
        "answer": "Keep high precision internally; for reports, round to a reasonable number of significant figures (for example, 2–4) and clearly label the unit and convention used."
