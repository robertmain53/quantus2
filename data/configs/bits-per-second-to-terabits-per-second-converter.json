    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts data transfer rates expressed in bits per second (bps) into terabits per second (Tbps) using standard SI prefix definitions. It is intended for engineers, network professionals, and anyone who needs fast, accurate unit conversions for capacity planning, reporting, or lab calculations.",
      "All conversions use the decimal SI prefix 'tera' (10^12). When working with bytes, remember 1 byte = 8 bits; this tool converts bits, not bytes. For regulatory or reporting contexts, follow the SI definitions published by standards bodies referenced below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the International System of Units (SI) prefix tera = 10^12 as published by international standards authorities. Therefore 1 terabit per second (1 Tbps) = 1 × 10^12 bits per second (1,000,000,000,000 bps).",
      "When converting from bits to terabits, we divide the bit count by 1,000,000,000,000 (10^12). For conversions involving bytes, first convert bytes to bits by multiplying by 8, then apply the same SI divisor.",
      "Practical measurement note: network throughput tools and hardware counters may report rounded values, averages, or peak instantaneous rates. For lab-grade accuracy, compare against calibrated test equipment and consult instrument specifications and measurement uncertainty guidance from relevant standards organizations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Tbps = bps ÷ 1,000,000,000,000",
      "Equivalently: Tbps = bps × 10^-12",
      "To convert the other way: bps = Tbps × 1,000,000,000,000",
      "If starting from bytes per second (B/s): Tbps = (B/s × 8) ÷ 1,000,000,000,000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000,000,000,000 bps → 1 Tbps",
      "1,000,000,000 bps (1 Gbps) → 0.001 Tbps",
      "100,000,000 bps (100 Mbps) → 0.0001 Tbps",
      "125,000,000 B/s (bytes per second) → 1 Tbps (because 125,000,000 × 8 = 1,000,000,000 bps = 0.001 Tbps; scale accordingly)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use divide-by-10^12 to go from bits per second to terabits per second. Confirm whether reported rates are bits or bytes and whether SI (decimal) or binary prefixes are being used in your context."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact numeric relationship between bps and Tbps?",
        "answer": "1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bits per second (10^12 bps). Therefore Tbps = bps ÷ 10^12."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does 'tera' ever mean 2^40 instead of 10^12?",
        "answer": "No. In SI, 'tera' is strictly 10^12. Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi) are used for powers of two (2^10, 2^20, etc.). For data rates and regulatory reporting, use the SI definition unless a binary prefix is explicitly stated."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert from bytes per second to Tbps?",
        "answer": "Multiply bytes per second by 8 to get bits per second, then divide by 10^12. Example: 125,000,000 B/s = 125,000,000 × 8 = 1,000,000,000 bps = 0.001 Tbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle precision and rounding for reporting?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context: for engineering specs keep enough significant figures to reflect instrument uncertainty; for high-level reporting 2–3 significant digits are common. Always indicate units and whether values are averages, peaks, or sustained measurements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there measurement or calibration considerations I should know?",
        "answer": "Yes. Network test equipment, packet capture, and hardware counters have limits and measurement uncertainty. Validate against calibrated instruments and consult instrument documentation and national metrology guidance for uncertainty budgets when precision matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative definitions for SI prefixes and unit practice?",
        "answer": "Refer to standards organizations such as the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for SI prefix definitions and best practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for reporting conventions used by ISPs or device manufacturers?",
        "answer": "This converter strictly applies SI definitions. Some vendors or reports may use abbreviated or rounded figures; always check the vendor's stated units and measurement method when comparing values."
