    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms bps to terabits per second for ultra-high-speed networks.",
      "Data center backbones operate at terabit speeds.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 terabit equals 1 trillion bits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps. To convert bps to Tbps, divide by 1 trillion.",
      "Ultra-fast networks measured in Tbps for data center interconnects.",
      "Understanding bps to Tbps conversion essential for network backbone design.",
      "This converter provides precise data rate conversion."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Data center backbone: 1 Tbps = 1 trillion bps.",
      "Example 2 – Fast interconnect: 400 Gbps = 0.4 Tbps.",
      "Example 3 – Future networks: 10 Tbps capabilities emerging."

      {
        "question": "What's a terabit per second?",
        "answer": "1 trillion bits per second. Only for ultra-fast data center networks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What uses terabit speeds?",
        "answer": "Data center backbone links, major internet exchange points, experimental networks."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is 1 Tbps practically?",
        "answer": "125 GB/s. Could transfer 1 million full HD movies per second."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the fastest real-world network?",
        "answer": "Data center: 400 Gbps (0.4 Tbps). Internet backbone: 100-400 Gbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will consumer internet use Tbps?",
        "answer": "Unlikely in foreseeable future. Consumer: 1-10 Gbps realistic by 2030."
      },
      {
        "question": "What limits speed?",
        "answer": "Physics (light speed in fiber), equipment cost, power consumption, heat."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do they achieve terabit speeds?",
        "answer": "Wavelength division multiplexing: multiple colors (wavelengths) simultaneous."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is terabit Internet possible?",
        "answer": "Theoretically yes. Practically: cost prohibitive for residential use."
