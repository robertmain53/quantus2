1. This is a **converter** because the task is to convert a single numeric value from one fixed unit (terabyte) to another fixed unit (gigabyte) using a constant mathematical relationship; users will input one value and expect one output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, form for converters, or any other disallowed keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
