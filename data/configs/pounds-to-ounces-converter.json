    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts pounds (lb) to ounces (oz) using the standard avoirdupois system where 1 pound equals 16 ounces. Enter a single numeric value in pounds to get the equivalent number of ounces.",
      "The converter is intended for everyday use, recipe scaling, shipping calculations, and basic engineering checks. It includes clear notes on precision, calibration, and situations where alternate units (for example troy ounces) are required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses a fixed mathematical relationship from the avoirdupois system: 1 pound = 16 ounces exactly. This relationship is a defined unit ratio and does not vary.",
      "For measurement best practices and declared accuracy, follow calibration and uncertainty guidance from national metrology organizations. Recommended references include national measurement institute guidance on unit definitions and calibration traceability.",
      "When entering measured values, account for scale resolution and calibration status. Report results with a number of significant figures consistent with the input measurement uncertainty; do not imply greater accuracy than the measurement permits."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: ounces = pounds × 16",
      "Inverse formula: pounds = ounces ÷ 16",
      "If pounds are provided in a compound form (pounds and fractional pounds), convert the entire value to decimal pounds then apply the primary formula. Example: 5 lb 8 oz = (5 + 8/16) lb = 5.5 lb → 5.5 × 16 = 88 oz"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2 lb → 2 × 16 = 32 oz",
      "0.25 lb → 0.25 × 16 = 4 oz",
      "3 lb 6 oz (convert mixed input): 3 + 6/16 = 3.375 lb → 3.375 × 16 = 54 oz"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion use troy ounces or avoirdupois ounces?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the avoirdupois ounce (1 oz = 28.349523125 g) and standard avoirdupois pound (1 lb = 16 oz). Troy ounces, used for precious metals, are different and are not used here."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures will the result show?",
        "answer": "The calculator returns numeric results without implying measurement uncertainty. For reporting, round results to match the input measurement's significant figures or the resolution of your scale. If your scale reads to the nearest 0.1 lb, report converted ounces to comparable precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert fractional pounds (for example 5.25 lb)?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert the decimal pounds directly by multiplying by 16. Example: 5.25 lb × 16 = 84 oz."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about calibration and accuracy?",
        "answer": "For tasks requiring traceable accuracy (commercial weighing, lab work, legal-for-trade), ensure your scale is calibrated against standards traceable to a national metrology institute and follow published calibration intervals and uncertainty reporting (see cited metrology guidance)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there any situation where the conversion factor of 16 would not apply?",
        "answer": "The factor 16 applies for the avoirdupois system. It does not apply to systems using different ounce definitions (for example troy ounce). For all standard everyday weight conversions between pounds and ounces, 16 is exact."
