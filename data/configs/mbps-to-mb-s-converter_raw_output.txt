1. This is a converter because Mbps → MB/s is a fixed unit conversion with a single numeric input and a single numeric output (bits per second ↔ bytes per second), so no multi-field form or conditional logic is required.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, or any extra UI/styling fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
