    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates the volume and approximate weight of soil, topsoil, mulch, or compost for landscape projects. Enter the length, width and depth in your chosen unit, and the tool converts to common construction and retail quantities: cubic feet, cubic yards, cubic meters, estimated short tons, and number of 40 lb bags.",
      "Results use a user-supplied bulk density (lb/ft³) to estimate weight. Typical bulk density values vary with material and moisture—use local extension guidance or supplier specifications where possible. For planning, allow overage to cover compaction and settling."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Dimensions are converted to cubic feet first. The select control provides a conversion factor from the entered unit to feet (1 ft = 1, 1 m = 3.28084 ft, 1 in = 1/12 ft, 1 cm = 0.0328084 ft). Volume in cubic feet = length × width × depth × (unit factor)^3.",
      "Cubic yards = cubic feet ÷ 27. Cubic meters = cubic feet × 0.028316846592. Weight in pounds = cubic feet × bulk density (lb/ft³). Short tons = weight (lb) ÷ 2000. Number of 40 lb bags = weight (lb) ÷ 40.",
      "Bulk density varies by material and moisture. Use a measured value when accuracy matters. University extension services and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service provide typical ranges for mineral soils, composts and mulches."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1) Convert each linear input to feet using the chosen unit factor.",
      "2) Compute volume (cu ft) = length_feet × width_feet × depth_feet.",
      "3) Cubic yards = cu ft ÷ 27; cubic meters = cu ft × 0.028316846592.",
      "4) Weight (lb) = cu ft × bulk density (lb/ft³); short tons = lb ÷ 2000.",
      "5) Bags (40 lb) = lb ÷ 40."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What should I enter for depth — packed or loose?",
        "answer": "Enter the depth of the material after installation (finished depth). If you order loose material that compacts after spreading, increase your order to allow for compaction. A common rule of thumb is 10–20% extra for lightly compacting materials; use measured compaction factors for greater accuracy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I pick bulk density?",
        "answer": "Bulk density depends on material and moisture. Typical topsoil ranges 70–100 lb/ft³, composts 20–45 lb/ft³, and mulches 10–30 lb/ft³. For construction purchases, use supplier data or local extension guidance. When in doubt, use a conservative (higher) bulk density for weight estimates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round up the calculator result when ordering?",
        "answer": "Yes. Suppliers and delivery loads have minimum increments (cubic yards or full truckloads). Also add 5–20% overage to account for compaction, uneven spreading, and measurement error—higher overage for deeper fills or heavier compaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator account for settling or compaction?",
        "answer": "Not automatically. The calculator gives as-built volume and an estimated weight from bulk density. Apply an additional factor (user judgment or project-specific measurement) to account for settling and compaction before ordering."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the unit conversions and formulas?",
        "answer": "Linear conversion factors and the volume formulas follow SI and industry-standard relationships (for example, 1 cubic foot = 0.028316846592 cubic meters and 1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet). For authoritative unit definitions see NIST guidance and for soil property ranges see USDA/NRCS and university extension resources."
