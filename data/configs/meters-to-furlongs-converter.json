    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length value in metres (meters) to furlongs. It is designed for users who need a fast, trustworthy numeric conversion with clarity on accuracy and regulatory context.",
      "The conversion uses the internationally agreed definitions that relate imperial units to the SI metre. The result is suitable for general engineering, surveying, historical references, and educational use, with guidance on rounding and calibration for precision-critical workflows."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the exact relationship between the yard and the metre (1 yard = 0.9144 m exactly) and the traditional definition of a furlong as 220 yards. Combining those definitions yields an exact factor for metres per furlong.",
      "Where high-precision measurements are required, follow calibration and measurement traceability practices consistent with ISO/IEC 17025 and consult national metrology guidance from NIST. Floating-point rounding and display formatting are independent considerations handled in the user interface."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition: 1 furlong = 220 yards and 1 yard = 0.9144 metres exactly.",
      "Therefore 1 furlong = 220 * 0.9144 = 201.168 metres exactly.",
      "Conversion formula (metres to furlongs): furlongs = metres / 201.168.",
      "Inverse formula (furlongs to metres): metres = furlongs * 201.168."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 201.168 metres → 201.168 / 201.168 = 1 furlong.",
      "Example 2: 1000 metres → 1000 / 201.168 ≈ 4.9728 furlongs (rounded to four decimal places)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The factor 1 furlong = 201.168 metres is exact because it follows the exact international definition 1 yard = 0.9144 m and 1 furlong = 220 yards. Numerical results may be rounded for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on use case. For general purposes 2 to 4 decimal places are common. For engineering or surveying, follow your project's required tolerance and calibration protocols; use more decimal places only if measurement uncertainty supports it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use these results for legal, safety, or certified measurement?",
        "answer": "This converter provides the mathematical conversion. For certified or legally-binding measurements, use measurement equipment and calibration traceable to accredited laboratories and follow ISO/IEC 17025 and applicable national regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might displayed results differ slightly from other calculators?",
        "answer": "Differences arise from rounding rules, number of displayed significant digits, or floating-point implementation in the display layer. The underlying conversion factor is exact; display differences are cosmetic unless they exceed your tolerance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regional variants of the furlong?",
        "answer": "The furlong used here follows the international/imperial definition of 220 yards. Historical or local usages may vary; verify historical sources when working with archival references."
