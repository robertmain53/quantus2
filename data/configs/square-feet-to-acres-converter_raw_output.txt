1. This is a "converter" because converting square feet to square meters is a fixed, single-step unit conversion with one input and one output and does not require additional variables or multi-step formulas.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" to match the schema requirements for unit conversions.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or a form object for this converter).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
