1. This is a converter because it converts between two area units (square feet ↔ square meters) that have a fixed mathematical relationship, requires one input and produces one output, and does not need additional variables or intermediate calculations.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converter, no canonical_url, no robots, no schema_org, no extra metadata fields, no UI/layout fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Related internal Cernarus pages I will reference in the config (as internal slugs, no external URLs): conversions/area (category hub), conversions/length/feet-to-meters (sibling length converter), conversions/area/square-meters-to-square-feet (sibling area converter), conversions/index (tools index).

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
