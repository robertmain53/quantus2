1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion between USD and AUD depends on a variable market exchange rate (and optional fees). It requires multiple inputs (amount, rate, fees) and produces one primary numeric output (converted amount), so it fits the "simple_calc" pattern.

2. I will use component_type: 'simple_calc' with logic.type: 'formula'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or form for converters). The config will include only fields allowed by the schema for simple_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
