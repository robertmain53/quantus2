      "This calculator computes your current net worth by summing commonly reported asset categories and subtracting liabilities. It also projects future net worth using a nominal expected return and optional inflation adjustment.",
      "Use the Current Net Worth method to get a snapshot today. Use the Projected Net Worth method to model outcomes from expected returns and annual contributions. Results are estimates for planning and should not be interpreted as investment advice."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Current net worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities. Asset and liability categories are additive and rely on user-provided market values or balances.",
      "Projected net worth uses the standard future value formula for a lump sum plus an annuity: FV = PV*(1+r)^n + PMT*(((1+r)^n - 1)/r). Where PV is starting net worth, r is the expected annual nominal return, PMT is annual contribution, and n is years. An inflation-adjusted (real) figure divides nominal FV by (1+inflation)^n.",
      "Accuracy, security, and numerical stability are important. Data handling and protective measures referenced follow guidance from authoritative standards: NIST for cybersecurity controls, ISO for financial planning standards, and IEEE for numerical/formatting best practices. Results are subject to rounding, precision limits, and the quality of inputs provided by the user."

      "Step 1: Sum asset fields to compute Total assets.",
      "Step 2: Sum liability fields to compute Total liabilities.",

      "Step 4 (Projection): Compute nominal future value using FV = PV*(1+r)^n + PMT*(((1+r)^n − 1)/r). If r equals zero, projection reduces to PV + PMT*n.",
      "Step 5 (Inflation adjustment): Real (inflation-adjusted) FV = nominal FV / (1+inflation)^n."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: If your starting net worth is $50,000, expected annual return is 5% (0.05), you contribute $5,000 per year, and project 10 years: nominal FV ≈ 50,000*(1.05)^10 + 5,000*(((1.05)^10 − 1) / 0.05).",
      "Inflation adjustment: With 2% inflation, divide the nominal future value by (1.02)^10 to estimate purchasing-power adjusted net worth."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the projections?",
        "answer": "Projections are mathematical estimates based on the inputs you provide. They assume constant annual returns and contributions and do not model year-to-year volatility, taxes, fees, or changes in contribution levels. Use results for planning, not precise forecasting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you account for taxes, fees, or market volatility?",
        "answer": "No. This tool uses deterministic formulas (constant return assumption). To include taxes, fees, or stochastic returns, use a dedicated financial planning tool or consult a licensed planner."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if expected annual return is zero?",
        "answer": "When expected annual return (r) equals zero, the annuity term simplifies to PMT * n and the lump-sum grows linearly. The tool uses the algebraic formula noted; if r is zero, use the alternative linear calculation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is my data protected?",
        "answer": "Recommendations and citations for secure data handling follow NIST cybersecurity guidance and ISO best practices. Do not enter sensitive credentials into calculators. For production integrations, use industry-standard encryption, access controls, and logging consistent with NIST and ISO recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is there a difference between nominal and inflation-adjusted results?",
        "answer": "Nominal results show the raw future dollar amount assuming the stated nominal return. Inflation-adjusted results convert nominal future value into today's purchasing power by discounting using the inflation rate you provide."
