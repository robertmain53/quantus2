      "This calculator computes Free Cash Flow using multiple commonly used methods so you can compare cash‑based and accrual‑based measures. Use the method that matches your data sources: operating cash flow if you have a cash flow statement, or the net income reconciliation if you only have an income statement.",
      "Results are intended for analysis and planning only. The tool provides intermediate variables (NOPAT, after‑tax interest, FCFF, FCFE) so you can see how reconciliations and adjustments affect the final FCF figure."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Available methods: (1) Operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, (2) Net income reconciliation (add non‑cash charges, subtract Δ working capital and CapEx), (3) Free Cash Flow to Firm (NOPAT + non‑cash charges − Δ working capital − CapEx), (4) Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFF adjusted for after‑tax interest and net debt flows).",
      "Calculation and implementation practices follow general software quality and security guidance. Adopted controls and recommendations reference NIST cybersecurity frameworks for data integrity and confidentiality, ISO quality management principles for input validation and change control, and IEEE software lifecycle best practices for traceability of formulas and tests. These references support dependable numeric results but do not replace professional audit or regulatory reporting requirements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "OCF method: Free Cash Flow = Operating cash flow − Capital expenditures.",
      "Net income reconciliation: Free Cash Flow = Net income + Depreciation & amortization − Δ Working capital − CapEx + Net borrowings − Dividends.",
      "FCFF: NOPAT = EBIT × (1 − tax rate). FCFF = NOPAT + Depreciation & amortization − Δ Working capital − CapEx.",
      "FCFE: FCFE = FCFF − After‑tax interest + Net borrowings − Debt repayments − Dividends, where After‑tax interest = Interest expense × (1 − tax rate)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: If operating cash flow is 120,000 and CapEx is 30,000, OCF method yields FCF = 90,000.",
      "Example 2: If net income 80,000 + D&A 10,000 − ΔWC 5,000 − CapEx 20,000 yields reconciled FCF = 65,000 (assuming no borrowings or dividends)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should CapEx be entered as a positive or negative number?",

      {
        "question": "How should I enter the tax rate?",
        "answer": "Enter the tax rate as a percentage (for example, 25 for 25%). After‑tax adjustments use tax_rate / 100 in formulas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method is most accurate?",
        "answer": "Accuracy depends on data quality. Use OCF − CapEx when reported cash flow is reliable. Use reconciliation methods when only accrual accounts are available. Compare methods as part of sensitivity analysis."

      {
        "question": "Does this tool replace audited financial statements or regulatory filings?",

        "answer": "Inputs may be estimates, rounding or classification differences across accounting standards can change results, and one‑time or non‑recurring items may require manual adjustments. Perform sensitivity checks and document assumptions."
