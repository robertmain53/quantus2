    "introduction": [
      "Quickly convert USD amounts to CAD using a specified exchange rate. This tool uses the rate you provide (CAD per USD) and optionally applies percentage and fixed fees to show gross and net CAD values.",
      "For accounting, tax reporting, or audits use published central bank rates or your bank/provider's guaranteed rate; this calculator is intended for estimates, reconciliation, and scenario planning."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This calculator applies a direct multiplication of the USD amount by the exchange rate to compute the gross CAD amount. Fees can be applied as a percentage of the converted CAD amount and/or as a fixed CAD fee. Results are presented in CAD and rounded to conventional currency precision.",
      "Rounding and displayed precision follow ISO and common financial practice (two decimal places for CAD). For formal reporting, use central bank or audited rate sources; the Bank of Canada publishes official reference rates and methodological notes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Converted gross (CAD) = Amount (USD) × Exchange rate (CAD per USD)",
      "Fee (CAD) = Converted gross (CAD) × (Fee percentage / 100) + Fixed fee (CAD)",
      "Converted net (CAD) = Converted gross (CAD) − Fee (CAD)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: 100 USD at 1.35 CAD/USD → Gross = 135.00 CAD. With 2% fee (2.70 CAD) and 0.00 fixed fee → Net = 132.30 CAD.",
      "Example: 1,000 USD at 1.25 CAD/USD with 1.5% fee and 5 CAD fixed fee → Gross = 1,250.00 CAD; Fee = 18.75 + 5.00 = 23.75 CAD; Net = 1,226.25 CAD."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where do I get a reliable exchange rate?",
        "answer": "Authoritative published rates are available from central banks and official statistical agencies. For Canada, consult the Bank of Canada exchange rates or the official market data used for accounting and reconciliation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool include the bank or provider spread?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator uses the exchange rate you enter and shows fees you specify. Actual provider rates typically include a spread and may differ from published mid-market rates; include those costs by adjusting the rate or adding fees."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision should I use for reporting?",
        "answer": "Use two decimal places for CAD in everyday accounting. For high-value reconciliations, keep internal calculations at higher precision (four or more decimal places) and round only for presentation, following ISO guidance for currency reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for tax or regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "This tool provides estimates. For tax filings, audited financial statements, or regulatory reports, use official rates and documented methodologies from relevant authorities and keep original source records."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are percentage and fixed fees applied?",
        "answer": "Percentage fees are applied to the converted gross CAD amount. Fixed fees are added in CAD after conversion. Both are subtracted from gross to produce net CAD received."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator fetch live market rates?",
        "answer": "Not in this standalone calculator. To use live rates, integrate with an API from a central bank or market data provider and supply the rate into the exchange rate field."
