    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms data measurements from Bits to Bytes, enabling translation between fundamental data units.",
      "The bit is the smallest unit of digital information (0 or 1), while the byte is the standard unit for data storage (8 bits). This conversion is fundamental to computing.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 byte equals exactly 8 bits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 byte = 8 bits. To convert bits to bytes, divide by 8. For example, 8 bits = 1 byte, 16 bits = 2 bytes, 1000 bits ≈ 125 bytes.",
      "Digital data is transmitted in bits per second (bps) but stored in bytes or larger units. Understanding the relationship helps with data transfer calculations.",
      "Computer memory is marketed in bytes (KB, MB, GB) while network speeds are specified in bits per second (kbps, Mbps, Gbps).",
      "This converter provides precise data size conversions for digital storage and transmission."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Email: An email with text content might be approximately 10 KB = 81,920 bits.",
      "Example 2 – Network speed: A 100 Mbps internet connection transfers approximately 12.5 MB per second.",
      "Example 3 – File size: A 1 GB file contains approximately 8 billion bits of information."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Bits to Bytes?",
        "answer": "1 byte = 8 bits. Divide bits by 8 to get bytes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is 1 byte equal to 8 bits?",
        "answer": "Bytes use 8 bits to represent 256 possible values (2^8). This became the standard unit for computer memory and storage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do bits per second relate to bytes per second?",
        "answer": "Divide bits per second by 8 to get bytes per second. A 1 Mbps connection = 125 KB/s data transfer rate."
