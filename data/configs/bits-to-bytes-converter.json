    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a value expressed in bits (b) into bytes (B) using the exact relationship 1 byte = 8 bits. It is useful for sizing payloads, estimating storage, or translating network measurements into byte-based units.",
      "For most networking and storage contexts, prefixes (k, M, G) follow decimal SI powers of 10. The same 8-bit relationship applies when using binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi); see the methodology notes for how to stay unambiguous."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Fundamental identity: 1 byte = 8 bits. The converter divides the bit value by 8 to obtain bytes.",
      "Prefix awareness: decimal prefixes (k, M, G) mean powers of 10 (1 kbit = 1,000 bits). Binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi) mean powers of 2 (1 Kibit = 1,024 bits). The bit→byte factor (÷8) is constant; choose the correct prefix system for your context.",
      "Precision and rounding: results are exact for the defined relationship. Round only for presentation to match reporting requirements or instrument precision."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: bytes = bits ÷ 8.",
      "Example: 8 bits → 1 byte; 1,000 bits → 125 bytes (decimal prefixes).",
      "Binary note: 8 Kibit = 8 × 1,024 bits = 8,192 bits → 1,024 bytes = 1 KiB."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "640 bits → 640 ÷ 8 = 80 bytes.",
      "4,096 bits → 512 bytes.",
      "1,000,000 bits → 125,000 bytes."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is 1 byte always 8 bits?",
        "answer": "Yes. Modern standards define a byte as 8 bits. Historical architectures with other byte sizes are rare and not used in current specifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about decimal vs binary prefixes here?",
        "answer": "The bit-to-byte factor is always ÷8. Just ensure you know whether the input uses decimal prefixes (k=1,000) or binary prefixes (Ki=1,024) when interpreting larger units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Keep full precision for calculations and round only for display, typically to whole bytes. Follow any precision rules required by your report, contract, or billing system."
