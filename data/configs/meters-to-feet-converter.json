    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts lengths from metres to feet using the internationally accepted relationship between the metre and the foot. The conversion is suitable for everyday measurements, engineering checks, and documentation where a standardised unit mapping is required.",
      "Use the converter to get a decimal feet result, or convert that result into feet and inches using the step-by-step method below. Read the accuracy notes and standards references if you need results for regulatory, engineering, or calibrated measurement purposes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The meter and the international foot are defined by international standards. The international foot is defined as exactly 0.3048 metres. Conversions are therefore derived from that exact definition to ensure traceability to SI units.",
      "This converter applies the fixed mathematical relationship between the two units rather than empirical approximation. Rounding and formatting options may be applied by the interface, but the underlying factor is exact as defined by international agreements and maintained by national measurement institutes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary conversion (metres to feet): multiply metres by 1 / 0.3048. Numerically: feet = metres x 3.280839895013123.",
      "To express a decimal-feet result as feet and inches: separate the integer feet part; multiply the fractional feet by 12 to get inches; round inches to the desired precision. Example: 1.75 ft becomes 1 ft and (0.75 x 12) = 9 in.",
      "To convert feet back to metres: multiply feet by 0.3048. This factor is exact under the international definition of the foot."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 2 metres → 2 × 3.280839895013123 = 6.561679790026246 feet → 6 feet and 0.561679790026246×12 = 6 feet 6.74 inches (round inches as needed).",
      "Example 2: 0.5 metres → 0.5 × 3.280839895013123 = 1.6404199475065616 feet → 1 foot and 0.6404199475065616×12 = 1 foot 7.68 inches."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The relationship used is exact for the international foot definition: 1 foot = 0.3048 metres exactly. The derived numeric multiplier for metres-to-feet is therefore exact in definition; decimal representations are rounded for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places are appropriate?",
        "answer": "Appropriate precision depends on context. For everyday use 2–3 decimal places in feet is usually sufficient. For engineering or calibration, follow your project's tolerance, measurement instrument resolution, or standards cited by your organisation (for example NIST or ISO guidance)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get feet and inches from metres?",
        "answer": "Convert metres to decimal feet, take the integer part as whole feet, multiply the fractional part by 12 to get inches, then round inches to the desired resolution (commonly nearest 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, or 0.1 inch)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there different 'foot' definitions that affect the result?",
        "answer": "The internationally adopted foot used here (international foot) is defined as 0.3048 metres exactly and is universally used for scientific and most engineering work. Historical or local definitions exist but are not used here; verify if you work with legacy systems that specify a different unit definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this converter for legal or certified measurements?",
        "answer": "This converter provides mathematically exact unit mapping based on international definitions. For legally binding, certified, or calibration-critical measurements, use calibrated instruments and refer to the relevant national metrology institute guidance and applicable regulations before reporting results."
