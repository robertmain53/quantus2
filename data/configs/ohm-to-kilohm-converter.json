    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms electrical resistance measurements from Ohms to Kilohms, enabling practical resistance values in electronics design. It is designed for electrical engineers, electronics technicians, and circuit designers.",
      "The Ohm is the SI unit of electrical resistance. Kilohms are used for larger resistances common in electronic circuits. This conversion is essential for circuit design and component specification.",
      "This converter uses the exact relationship where 1 kilohm equals 1,000 ohms."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 kilohm = 1,000 ohms. To convert ohms to kilohms, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 Ω = 1 kΩ, 10,000 Ω = 10 kΩ, 100,000 Ω = 100 kΩ.",
      "Common resistor values: 1 kΩ (1,000 Ω), 10 kΩ (10,000 Ω), 100 kΩ (100,000 Ω) are standard component values. Using kilohms simplifies circuit documentation.",
      "Electronics circuits typically use kilohm-range resistors for biasing, feedback, and impedance matching. Accurate unit conversion is essential for circuit design.",
      "This converter provides precise resistance conversions for circuit design, component selection, and electronics documentation."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Pull-up resistor: A 10 kΩ (10,000 Ω) pull-up resistor is standard in digital circuits.",
      "Example 2 – Filter network: A 1 kΩ (1,000 Ω) input impedance is common in analog filter design.",
      "Example 3 – Voltage divider: A 100 kΩ (100,000 Ω) resistor network sets amplifier gain.",
      "Example 4 – Bias resistor: A 47 kΩ (47,000 Ω) biasing resistor is standard in bipolar transistor circuits."

      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from ohm to kilohm?",
        "answer": "1 kΩ = 1,000 Ω. Divide ohms by 1,000 to get kilohms."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are standard resistor values?",
        "answer": "E12 series: 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, 82 (multiply by decade). Common values: 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 100 kΩ."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate resistor values for circuits?",
        "answer": "Use Ohm's Law (V = IR) and desired current to find required resistance. For example, 5V source with 1mA desired current: R = V/I = 5/0.001 = 5,000 Ω = 5 kΩ."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is resistance tolerance?",
        "answer": "Resistor values have tolerance (±5%, ±1%, ±0.1%). Select tolerance appropriate for your circuit. Precision circuits require 1% or better tolerances."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does temperature affect resistance?",
        "answer": "Most resistors change resistance with temperature (temperature coefficient). For precision work, select resistors with low temperature coefficients."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is resistor power rating?",
        "answer": "Power dissipated = V²/R or I²×R. Select resistors with power ratings exceeding calculated dissipation. Common ratings: 1/4W, 1/2W, 1W, 2W."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I parallel resistors?",
        "answer": "Parallel resistance: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... For equal resistors: R_total = R/N. Parallel resistors reduce total resistance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I select resistors for analog circuits?",
        "answer": "Use precision resistors (1% tolerance) in feedback networks affecting circuit gain. Use standard resistors (5%) for non-critical applications like pull-ups."
