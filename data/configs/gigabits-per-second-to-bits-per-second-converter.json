    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms gigabit speeds to raw bits per second, enabling detailed network performance analysis.",
      "Converting Gbps to bps helps understand the fundamental data transfer rate underlying network speeds.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 gigabit per second equals exactly 1 billion bits per second."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps. To convert Gbps to bps, multiply by 1,000,000,000.",
      "Expressing speeds in bps reveals the raw data rate underlying high-speed connections.",
      "Understanding gigabit speeds in bits is essential for network engineering and optimization.",
      "This converter provides precise data rate conversion for technical analysis."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Standard Gigabit Ethernet: 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps.",
      "Example 2 – High-speed fiber: 10 Gbps = 10,000,000,000 bps.",
      "Example 3 – Next-gen fiber: 100 Gbps = 100,000,000,000 bps."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why express speeds in bits per second?",
        "answer": "bps is the fundamental unit. Gbps is convenient but bps shows raw data rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I understand network bottlenecks?",
        "answer": "Convert all speeds to same unit (bps) and identify slowest link in data path."
      },
      {
        "question": "What limits data transfer rate?",
        "answer": "Physical medium (fiber vs copper), distance, signal quality, and equipment capabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is 10 Gbps fast enough for servers?",
        "answer": "10 Gbps (10 billion bps) handles high-demand server traffic; 100 Gbps required for data centers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does bps relate to storage?",
        "answer": "Data rate (bps) transfers data to storage (measured in bytes). Transfer time = size (bytes) / rate (bps)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is burst speed vs sustained speed?",
        "answer": "Burst: temporary maximum speed. Sustained: average speed over time. bps measures sustained rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do network speeds compare globally?",
        "answer": "US avg ~100 Mbps; South Korea/Japan ~500+ Mbps; developing nations ~10-50 Mbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between bps and Bps?",
        "answer": "bps = bits per second. Bps = bytes per second. 1 byte = 8 bits. 1 Gbps = 125 MB/s."
