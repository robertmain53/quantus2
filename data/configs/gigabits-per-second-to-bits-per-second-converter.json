    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms values expressed in gigabits per second (Gbps) into bits per second (bps) using standard unit definitions. It is intended for networking, benchmarking, and documentation tasks where an exact conversion is required.",
      "By default the tool uses the SI decimal definition for the 'giga' prefix (1 G = 10^9). If you need binary/IEC conversions (gibi, Gi), see the methodology and examples below for the alternate calculation and practical guidance.",
      "Content and guidance reference national metrology and regulatory resources to help you interpret results for measurement, calibration, and reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The canonical decimal conversion uses the SI prefix 'giga' (10^9). In telecommunications and most service-level contexts, 1 Gbps = 1 × 10^9 bps (one billion bits per second). This is the default interpretation used here.",
      "Binary (IEC) prefixes exist for powers-of-two notation. The binary counterpart 'gibi' (Gi) denotes 2^30. When someone writes 'Gibit/s' or 'Gib/s' they usually mean 1 Gi = 1,073,741,824 bits per second. Verify which prefix (G vs Gi) your instrument or specification uses before reporting.",
      "Measurement and reporting notes: hardware counters, protocol overhead, and test-tool resolution affect measured throughput. For traceable calibration or compliance checks, consult national metrology guidance and use calibrated test instruments with documented uncertainty."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) conversion used by this tool: value_in_bps = value_in_Gbps × 1,000,000,000 (1 × 10^9). Example: 2.5 Gbps → 2.5 × 1,000,000,000 = 2,500,000,000 bps.",
      "Binary (IEC) alternative (use when source explicitly uses 'Gibit/s' or 'Gib/s'): value_in_bps = value_in_Gibps × 1,073,741,824 (2^30). Example: 1 Gib/s → 1,073,741,824 bps.",
      "To convert bits per second to bytes per second, divide by 8. For example, 1,000,000,000 bps → 125,000,000 B/s (bytes per second)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1 Gbps (decimal): 1 × 1,000,000,000 = 1,000,000,000 bps.",
      "Convert 2.5 Gbps (decimal): 2.5 × 1,000,000,000 = 2,500,000,000 bps.",
      "Binary example (1 Gib/s): 1 × 1,073,741,824 = 1,073,741,824 bps."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between Gbps and bps?",
        "answer": "Using the SI decimal prefix: 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bits per second (1 × 10^9 bps). If an alternate (binary/IEC) prefix is intended, 1 Gibit/s = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 bps."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert Gbps to bytes per second (B/s)?",
        "answer": "Divide the bit-rate by 8. Example: 1 Gbps (1,000,000,000 bps) ÷ 8 = 125,000,000 bytes per second."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use the binary (Gib) value instead of G (giga)?",
        "answer": "Use the binary (Gib) value only when the source explicitly uses IEC binary prefixes (Gib, Mib, Kib) or when working with systems that define capacities in powers of two. Networking service rates and most protocol-level rates use SI decimal prefixes (G)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can measurement tools report a different number than this conversion?",
        "answer": "Yes. Measured throughput may be lower than the theoretical conversion due to protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgements), hardware limitations, sampling resolution, and test methodology. For traceable measurements, use calibrated equipment and document test conditions and uncertainties."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report values for compliance or procurement?",
        "answer": "State the prefix convention explicitly (e.g., 'Gbps (SI, 10^9)' or 'Gib/s (IEC, 2^30)'), include significant figures or rounding rules used, and record the measurement method and instrument calibration status to support reproducibility and compliance reviews."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there recommended references for unit definitions and calibration?",
        "answer": "Yes. National metrology and standards organizations provide definitive guidance on SI and binary prefixes, and national labs publish calibration procedures and uncertainty guidance for electrical and network measurements."
