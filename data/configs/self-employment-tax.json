      "This calculator estimates self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare) and provides a simple federal income tax estimate and suggested quarterly payment. It supports a detailed split of taxes and a quick rule-of-thumb mode.",

    "methodology": [
      "Net earnings from self-employment are computed as 92.35% of net profit (gross receipts minus allowable business expenses) to reflect the IRS calculation for self-employment tax.",
      "Self-employment tax is split into Social Security (12.4% on the applicable wage base) and Medicare (2.9% on net earnings). Additional Medicare Tax (0.9%) is applied on earnings above filing-status thresholds. The calculator optionally applies a Social Security wage base if provided.",
      "Income tax is estimated by applying a user-provided effective federal tax rate to a simplified taxable income estimate (other taxable income plus net profit minus the deductible half of SE tax). This is a simplified approach for planning and is not a substitute for a full tax return calculation."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Net earnings = (gross_income - business_expenses) × 0.9235",

      "Estimated income tax = max(0, (other taxable income + (net profit − employer-equivalent deduction)) × effective tax rate − withheld tax)",
      "Total tax = self-employment tax + estimated income tax; quarterly payment = total tax ÷ 4"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example (detailed): Gross income $80,000; expenses $15,000; net earnings = ($80,000 − $15,000) × 0.9235 = $60,372. Self-employment tax splits into Social Security, Medicare, and any Additional Medicare as applicable. The employer-equivalent deduction reduces estimated taxable income.",
      "Example (quick): Same profit with 15.3% applied to net earnings gives a fast SE tax estimate without wage-base capping or Additional Medicare splitting."

    "summary": [
      "Use the detailed mode for closer alignment with IRS calculations. Use the quick mode for a fast planning estimate.",

        "question": "Is this an exact tax return calculation?",
        "answer": "No. This tool produces planning estimates only and does not replace a tax return, professional advice, or software that computes tax with full schedules and credits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do the rates come from?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses common statutory SE tax rates (12.4% Social Security, 2.9% Medicare, plus 0.9% Additional Medicare above thresholds). Wage bases and exact thresholds change yearly; enter a wage base value if you want the cap applied."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do you use 92.35% of net profit?",
        "answer": "The IRS prescribes that net earnings subject to self-employment tax are generally 92.35% of net profit to account for the employer-equivalent portion that self-employed people effectively pay."

      {
        "question": "Is this tool secure and reliable?",
        "answer": "We follow recognized security and testing practices (see citations) for data handling. Accuracy depends on user inputs and assumptions; always verify with official IRS guidance or a tax professional."
