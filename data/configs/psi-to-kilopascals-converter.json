To convert PSI to kPa, multiply by 6.89476. For example, 20 PSI ≈ 138 kPa, 35 PSI ≈ 241 kPa.","Equipment from different regions may use different pressure units, requiring conversion for proper setup.","Safety systems depend on correct pressure specifications. Understanding conversion is critical.","This converter provides precise pressure conversions for equipment maintenance."],"examples":["Example 1 – Tire pressure: 32 PSI equals approximately 220 kPa.","Example 2 – Air compressor: A 100 PSI rating equals approximately 690 kPa.","Example 3 – Hydraulic system: 5,000 PSI equals approximately 34,474 kPa."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from PSI to Kilopascals?","answer":"1 PSI ≈ 6.89476 kPa.
