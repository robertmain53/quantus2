      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms pressures from PSI (pounds per square inch) to kilopascals (kPa), enabling technicians and engineers to work seamlessly across North American and metric pressure standards. It is designed for HVAC service technicians, automotive professionals, and engineers who encounter mixed pressure specifications.",
        "The PSI is traditional in North American equipment and legacy systems, while the kilopascal is the modern SI standard used in international technical codes, scientific work, and contemporary specifications. Understanding this conversion is essential for equipment selection, system documentation, and technical troubleshooting.",
        "The converter applies the exact, mathematically precise relationship derived from SI and imperial standards, ensuring reliable results for all pressure system applications and compliance with modern technical documentation practices."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The kilopascal (kPa) is the metric standard, equal to 1,000 pascals in the SI system. The PSI is the imperial unit defined as one pound-force per square inch. The exact relationship between these units is: 1 PSI = 6.89476 kPa (or equivalently, 1 PSI = 1 ÷ 0.145038 kPa). This factor is derived from the standardized conversions between imperial and SI units.",
        "To convert a pressure from PSI to kilopascals, you multiply the value in PSI by 6.89476. For example, 30 PSI = 206.84 kPa, 60 PSI = 413.69 kPa, and 100 PSI = 689.48 kPa. This factor is used consistently in HVAC documentation, automotive specifications, and industrial systems worldwide.",
        "The converter applies full-precision floating-point multiplication internally to maintain maximum numerical accuracy. Results are displayed rounded to practical precision (typically one to two decimal places), suitable for equipment specifications, system commissioning, and troubleshooting guidance.",
        "Because the conversion factor is exact and standardized, this converter produces results consistent with NIST conversion standards, HVAC technical manuals, automotive equipment specifications, and modern building codes that require metric pressure units."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Residential HVAC: A typical air conditioning system low-side pressure of 30 PSI converts to approximately 206.84 kPa, a standard reading for technicians working with modern pressure-temperature charts in metric units.",
        "Example 2 – Tire pressure: A common tire specification of 32 PSI converts to approximately 220.64 kPa, equivalent to modern metric tire pressure ratings on imported vehicles.",
        "Example 3 – Industrial compressed air: A plant air pressure specification of 100 PSI converts to approximately 689.48 kPa, typical for high-power pneumatic systems documented in metric standards.",
        "Example 4 – Atmospheric baseline: Standard atmospheric pressure is 14.696 PSI, which converts to approximately 101.325 kPa, the baseline reference used in all pressure calculations worldwide."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact conversion from PSI to kilopascals?",
          "answer": "The exact factor is 1 PSI = 6.89476 kPa. To convert any pressure in PSI to kPa, multiply by 6.89476. This factor is the reciprocal of the kPa-to-PSI factor and is standardized globally by metrology institutes and equipment manufacturers."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do modern HVAC codes require kilopascal pressures?",
          "answer": "Kilopascals are part of the SI metric system, which is the international standard adopted by most countries and modern technical codes. HVAC professionals increasingly work with metric pressure specifications in codes, manufacturer data, and technical documentation, making this conversion essential."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I quickly estimate PSI to kPa?",
          "answer": "A useful approximation is to multiply PSI by 7 to get a rough kPa value. For example, 100 PSI × 7 = 700 kPa (actual: 689.48 kPa), accurate to within about 1.5%. This mental math is very practical for field work."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this conversion exact enough for HVAC system commissioning?",
          "answer": "Yes. The conversion factor 6.89476 is the standard used by HVAC equipment manufacturers and reflected in pressure-temperature charts, service procedures, and commissioning documentation. For system setup and troubleshooting, this exact factor ensures your work aligns with both North American and international standards."
        },
        {
          "question": "What precision should I use for pressure conversions in technical work?",
          "answer": "For most HVAC and automotive applications, one decimal place in the kPa result is sufficient. For technical documentation or formal commissioning reports, maintain two to three significant figures (e.g., 30 PSI = 206.8 kPa). Always follow your equipment specifications and regional building codes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use this converter for both absolute and gauge pressures?",
          "answer": "Yes. The conversion factor applies equally to absolute pressure (measured from a vacuum) and gauge pressure (measured from atmospheric). Just ensure your input is consistently labeled as one or the other. At sea level, 0 psig equals about 101.325 kPa absolute."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do high-pressure systems (like hydraulics) convert from PSI to kPa?",
          "answer": "The conversion factor applies to all pressure values. High-pressure hydraulic systems (e.g., 3,000 PSI) convert to approximately 20,684 kPa. For very high pressures, you may also express the result in megapascals (MPa) by dividing kPa by 1,000."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do modern pressure gauges show both PSI and kPa scales?",
          "answer": "Modern dual-scale gauges use the exact conversion factor (6.89476 PSI per kPa) to synchronize both scales mechanically or electronically, so a needle or digital reading in PSI automatically corresponds to the correct kPa value on the companion scale."
