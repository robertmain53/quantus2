1. This is a simple_calc because contribution margin requires multiple related inputs (for example: price or total revenue and variable cost per unit or total variable costs) to compute a primary financial result (contribution margin amount and contribution margin percentage), so a formula-based form with several fields is required.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), and no HTML tags.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, extra metadata beyond title and description, and no custom UI/layout keys). I will include only the allowed fields for a simple_calc (metadata, logic with outputs, form with fields, page_content, links, schema where applicable).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
