    "introduction": [
      "Net Profit Margin expresses how much of each dollar of revenue remains as profit after all costs, operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other items are accounted for. It is a key profitability metric used by managers, lenders, and investors to compare performance across periods or peers.",
      "This calculator computes Net Income and Net Profit Margin from user-provided line items. It is intended as an accuracy-assisting tool for analysis and planning; for statutory filings or audited financials, follow GAAP/IFRS guidance and consult a licensed accountant."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Net Income is calculated as: Net Income = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses - Interest Expense - Taxes + Other Income. This follows the standard top-down income statement structure used in financial reporting.",
      "Net Profit Margin (%) is calculated as: (Net Income / Revenue) × 100. When Revenue equals zero, the margin is undefined; interpret negative or extremely large values as signals to review revenue recognition and one-time items.",
      "Inputs should reflect the same accounting basis (e.g., all on an accrual basis or all cash basis). For comparability with regulatory filings, align line items with definitions in financial statements guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and FASB."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: Revenue $100,000; COGS $40,000; Opex $30,000; Interest $2,000; Taxes $5,000; Other Income $0 → Net Income $23,000; Net Margin 23.00%.",
      "Use-case: Compare monthly net margin to identify seasonality or the impact of one-time expenses such as restructuring or asset impairments."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What if revenue is zero or negative?",
        "answer": "If revenue is zero, net margin is mathematically undefined (division by zero). If revenue is negative (rare, e.g., returns exceed sales), treat results as abnormal and investigate revenue recognition, refunds, or data-entry errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I include non-operating items in Other Income?",
        "answer": "Yes — this calculator includes Other Income (or loss) so the Net Income matches the bottom line of a comprehensive income statement. For operating profitability analysis, consider using Operating Margin (exclude interest and taxes)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the results and how should I round?",
        "answer": "Monetary outputs are presented as currency rounded to two decimals and percentage to two decimal places. For regulatory or audit work, follow the rounding rules specified by your reporting framework or auditor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this calculation GAAP/IFRS compliant?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic follows common financial-statement structure, but compliance depends on how line items were measured and classified in your accounting system. For assurance-level reporting, rely on audited statements prepared under GAAP or IFRS and consult a CPA."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is Net Profit Margin used by lenders and investors?",
        "answer": "Lenders and investors use net margin to assess overall profitability and sustainability. Compare margins across time and to industry benchmarks rather than in isolation. Large one-time gains or losses can distort margins and should be disclosed and adjusted for normalized analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I need consolidated or multi-entity margins?",
        "answer": "Aggregate each entity's revenue and expenses on the same basis (consolidated totals) before calculating margin. Pay attention to intercompany eliminations and minority interests used in consolidated financials."
