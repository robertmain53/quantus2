    "introduction": [
      "Use this calculator to convert an amount of Ethereum (ETH) into an estimated US Dollar (USD) value using the price you provide. The tool surface shows gross value, estimated exchange fees, slippage, network (gas) costs, and the net USD you'll receive.",
      "Because cryptocurrency market prices move continuously, enter a time-stamped market price or use a live price from your provider. This calculator is deterministic: it shows how fees, slippage and network costs change your effective USD proceeds."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This calculator multiplies the ETH amount by the USD price per ETH to get a gross USD value, then subtracts exchange fees, estimated slippage, and network fees to produce a net USD amount.",
      "Recommended practice: use a time-stamped mid-market or last-trade price from your custody or trading provider; record the timestamp for accounting and tax records. For standards around currency codes and representation, this tool follows ISO 4217 conventions.",
      "Precision and rounding: values are computed with typical financial decimal precision and displayed in USD. For settlement or accounting, round per your local regulation and accounting standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Gross USD = Amount (ETH) × Price (USD per ETH)",
      "Exchange fee (USD) = Gross USD × (Exchange fee % ÷ 100)",
      "Estimated slippage (USD) = Gross USD × (Slippage % ÷ 100)",
      "Net USD = Gross USD − Exchange fee − Slippage − Network (gas) fee",
      "Effective price (USD per ETH) = Net USD ÷ Amount (ETH)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where should I get the 'Price (USD per ETH)' value?",
        "answer": "Use the time-stamped price from the exchange, broker, or market data provider you plan to use for the transaction. For reconciliation and auditability, capture the source and timestamp. Government and standards bodies recommend preserving transactional evidence for financial reporting and tax purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do values differ between platforms?",
        "answer": "Prices vary across venues due to liquidity, order-book depth, and timestamp differences. Slippage and fees also vary. This calculator uses your inputs to show how those elements affect net proceeds; it does not pull or normalize live market spreads."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this for tax or settlement reporting?",
        "answer": "This tool provides a computed USD equivalent for the inputs you supply. For tax, accounting, or legal reporting, use exchange-provided settlement records and consult tax guidance from your jurisdiction. The IRS and other tax authorities set rules for valuation and timing of recognition."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I account for network/gas fees in USD?",
        "answer": "Convert gas fees from ETH to USD using the same price timestamp you use for the principal, or use the settled USD amount from your provider. Record both ETH and USD representations for transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about regulatory or compliance considerations?",
        "answer": "Transactions involving crypto may be subject to KYC/AML and reporting rules in your jurisdiction. Consult official guidance from relevant agencies (for example, financial regulators and tax authorities) to ensure compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why include slippage as a percent instead of an absolute USD?",
        "answer": "Slippage is typically proportional to trade size relative to available liquidity, so a percent estimate maps more directly to varying trade sizes. If you prefer, calculate slippage USD externally and enter it via the network/gas fee field or by adjusting the price input."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the displayed currency values?",
        "answer": "Displayed results use standard financial numeric formats. For settlement or legal records, round according to applicable accounting rules (for example, two decimal places for USD) and preserve underlying timestamps and source data."
