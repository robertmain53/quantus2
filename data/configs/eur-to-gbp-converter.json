    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts an amount in Euros (EUR) to British Pounds (GBP) using the current market reference exchange rate. Results reflect a straight multiplication by the selected rate and are intended for estimation and planning.",
      "Official reference rates published by central banks and international standards bodies are used to show the mid-market conversion. Actual amounts you receive from banks, card networks, or money-transfer services may differ because of provider spreads, transaction fees, and timing."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We obtain a reference (mid-market) EUR→GBP exchange rate from authoritative sources updated frequently during market hours. The converter multiplies your EUR input by that rate to produce a GBP estimate.",
      "This tool does not apply provider-specific spreads or fixed fees. For final amounts, add known service fees or use your provider's published exchange rate. Rounding follows common financial rules (pence precision) and is shown in the example section.",
      "For regulatory and audit purposes, central bank reference series (European Central Bank, Bank of England) and ISO currency identifiers (ISO 4217) are used as authoritative anchors."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Obtain the reference exchange rate: reference_rate = EUR/GBP mid-market rate from authoritative sources.",
      "Step 2 — Multiply: converted_amount_gbp = amount_eur × reference_rate.",
      "Step 3 — Present value: round to two decimal places (pence). Note: final settlement may include provider spreads or fees applied on top of this value."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100.00 EUR × 0.85000 = 85.00 GBP (rounded to 2 decimals). This is a mid-market estimate — provider rate may be lower after spread.",
      "Example 2: 1,000.00 EUR × 0.87050 = 870.50 GBP (rounded). If a provider charges a 1.0% spread, their effective rate would reduce the GBP received accordingly."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How often are exchange rates updated?",
        "answer": "Reference rates are refreshed frequently during market hours; central bank published reference rates update on daily schedules. For live trading or large transfers, check the timestamp and source used by your provider or this tool's data feed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the amount I get differ from this converter?",
        "answer": "This converter shows a mid-market estimate. Banks and payment services add a spread (markup) and may charge fixed fees. Differences also arise from timing, settlement method, and whether a provider uses a proprietary intraday rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter suitable for accounting or tax reporting?",
        "answer": "Use official published exchange rates required by your regulator or tax authority for accounting and tax reporting. Many jurisdictions instruct use of central bank reference rates or specific lookup tables; for UK tax guidance see HM Revenue & Customs resources."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the result and how is rounding handled?",
        "answer": "Results are shown rounded to two decimal places (pence). For large-value conversions or reconciliation, keep more precision in internal records and apply your provider's rounding and settlement rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert GBP back to EUR with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes — converting back uses the inverse rate (1 / reference_rate) or by retrieving the GBP→EUR reference rate if available. Be aware that double-conversion and provider spreads amplify discrepancies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do the reference rates come from and which standards are used?",
        "answer": "Reference rates are based on authoritative central bank series and international standards such as ISO 4217 for currency codes. See the citations below for primary sources and methodological notes."
