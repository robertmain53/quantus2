1. This is a simple_calc because gross margin requires multiple numeric inputs (e.g., revenue and cost of goods sold, optional direct costs) and uses a formula to compute one or more financial outputs (gross profit and gross margin percentage). It is not a unit conversion and does not require multiple alternative methods.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url) and no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, or converter-form for converters, etc.). The form object will be present because simple_calc requires it, and it will only include allowed fields.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
