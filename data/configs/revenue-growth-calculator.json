1. This is a simple_calc because the fuel-cost calculation needs multiple related inputs (distance, fuel efficiency, fuel price, trips) and produces one primary result (total fuel cost) plus a few derived outputs (fuel required, cost per mile). The relationship is a formula, not a fixed unit conversion.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or other extra metadata; and converters-only rules will not be applied since this is a simple_calc).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
