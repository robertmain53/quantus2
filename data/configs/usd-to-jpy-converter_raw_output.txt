1. This is a converter because the user wants to convert a single monetary amount from one unit (USD) to another (JPY): one input → one output, matching the converter use case for unit-to-unit conversion.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, no robots, no schema_org, no extra metadata fields, no UI/layout/styling fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
