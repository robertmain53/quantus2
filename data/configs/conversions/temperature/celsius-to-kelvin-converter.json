      "introduction": [
        "This Celsius to Kelvin converter provides scientifically exact temperature conversions based on the International System of Units (SI).",
        "Designed for scientists, engineers, and students, this tool ensures your thermodynamic calculations are accurate by applying the official formula without approximation.",
        "We provide the standard methodology, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert Celsius to Kelvin with confidence, explaining key concepts like absolute zero and the correct use of the kelvin unit."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert a temperature from Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K), the calculator uses the standard formula: K = °C + 273.15.",
        "This is not an approximation but the formal definition that links the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, which is the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature.",
        "The Celsius scale is defined such that 0.01 °C is the triple point of water, and a change of 1 °C is equivalent to a change of 1 K. The offset of 273.15 aligns the Celsius scale with absolute zero (0 K)."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Scientific Research: A chemist conducting an experiment at 25 °C would record this temperature as 298.15 K for use in thermodynamic equations.",
        "Physics: The boiling point of water at standard pressure is 100 °C, which is 373.15 K.",
        "Cryogenics: Liquid nitrogen boils at approximately -196 °C, which is equivalent to 77.15 K, a critical value in low-temperature physics and material science."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert Celsius to Kelvin?",
          "answer": "The official formula is K = °C + 273.15. To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, you simply add 273.15."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is it 'kelvin' and not 'degrees Kelvin'?",
          "answer": "The kelvin is an absolute scale where 0 K is absolute zero. Unlike Celsius or Fahrenheit, it does not use 'degrees'. The unit is simply 'kelvin' and the symbol is K, according to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is absolute zero?",
          "answer": "Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, defined as 0 K on the Kelvin scale and -273.15 °C on the Celsius scale. It is the point at which particles have minimal vibrational motion."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can Kelvin be negative?",
          "answer": "No, by definition, the Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero (0 K), so there are no negative Kelvin temperatures."
