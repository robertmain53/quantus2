      "introduction": [
        "This Fahrenheit to Celsius converter provides instant and accurate temperature conversions using the universally accepted scientific formula.",
        "Whether you're a traveler from the U.S. abroad, a chef using a European recipe, or a student, this tool ensures your temperature conversions are precise.",
        "We provide the official formula, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius with confidence and understand the science behind the scales."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C), the calculator uses the standard formula: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9.",
        "First, 32 is subtracted from the Fahrenheit temperature.",
        "Then, the result is multiplied by 5/9 (or approximately 0.5555) to get the final temperature in Celsius.",
        "This formula is the exact definition for converting between the two scales and is recognized by standards bodies worldwide, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Weather: A hot summer day in the U.S. is 95°F. This converts to 35°C, a common temperature for a heatwave in Europe.",
        "Cooking: A standard oven temperature for baking is 350°F. This is equivalent to approximately 177°C.",
        "Health: A fever of 101°F is a body temperature of 38.3°C, which is important to know for medical purposes when traveling."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius?",
          "answer": "The official formula is Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) × 5/9. This is the standard scientific method for conversion."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a quick way to estimate the conversion?",
          "answer": "For a rough estimate, you can subtract 30 from the Fahrenheit value and then divide by 2. For example, for 70°F, the estimate is (70 - 30) / 2 = 20°C. The exact answer is 21.1°C, so this shortcut is useful for quick mental calculations."
        },
        {
          "question": "At what temperature are Fahrenheit and Celsius equal?",
          "answer": "-40 degrees is the unique point where both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales match (-40°F = -40°C)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the freezing and boiling points of water in Fahrenheit and Celsius?",
          "answer": "Water freezes at 32°F (which is 0°C) and boils at 212°F (which is 100°C) at standard atmospheric pressure."
