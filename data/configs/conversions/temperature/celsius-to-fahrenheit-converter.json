      "introduction": [
        "This Celsius to Fahrenheit converter provides instant and accurate temperature conversions using the universally accepted scientific formula.",
        "Whether you're a traveler interpreting a weather forecast, a chef converting a recipe, or a student completing a science assignment, this tool ensures your results are precise.",
        "We provide the official formula, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert temperatures with confidence and understand the science behind the scales."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert a temperature from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F), the calculator uses the standard formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32.",
        "First, the Celsius temperature is multiplied by 9/5 (or 1.8).",
        "Then, 32 is added to the result to get the final temperature in Fahrenheit.",
        "This formula is the exact definition for converting between the two scales and is recognized by standards bodies worldwide, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Weather: A weather forecast in Europe shows a temperature of 25°C. This converts to 77°F, a pleasant and warm day.",
        "Cooking: A recipe requires an oven temperature of 200°C. This is equivalent to 392°F, a common setting for roasting.",
        "Health: A body temperature of 37°C is considered normal and converts to 98.6°F."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?",
          "answer": "The official formula is Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32. You can also use the decimal form: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 1.8) + 32."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a quick way to estimate the conversion?",
          "answer": "For a rough estimate, you can double the Celsius temperature and add 30. For example, 10°C is approximately (10 × 2) + 30 = 50°F. The exact answer is 50°F, so this shortcut works well for moderate temperatures."
        },
        {
          "question": "At what temperature are Celsius and Fahrenheit equal?",
          "answer": "-40 degrees is the unique point where both the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales match (-40°C = -40°F)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Celsius relate to Kelvin?",
          "answer": "The Celsius and Kelvin scales have the same magnitude per degree, but the Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273.15 (K = °C + 273.15)."
