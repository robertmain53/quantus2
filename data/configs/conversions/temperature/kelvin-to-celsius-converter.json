      "introduction": [
        "This Kelvin to Celsius converter provides scientifically exact temperature conversions based on the International System of Units (SI).",
        "Designed for scientists, engineers, and students, this tool ensures your thermodynamic calculations are accurate by applying the official formula without approximation.",
        "We provide the standard methodology, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert Kelvin to Celsius with confidence, explaining key concepts like absolute zero and the correct use of the kelvin unit."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert a temperature from Kelvin (K) to Celsius (°C), the calculator uses the standard formula: °C = K - 273.15.",
        "This is not an approximation but the formal definition that links the Kelvin scale, the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature, to the Celsius scale.",
        "The size of one degree Celsius is identical to that of one kelvin. The offset of 273.15 aligns the zero point of the Celsius scale (0°C) with the freezing point of water, whereas 0 K is absolute zero."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Chemistry: A standard ambient temperature of 298.15 K is used in many thermodynamic calculations and is equal to 25 °C.",
        "Astronomy: The surface temperature of the sun is approximately 5,778 K, which converts to about 5,505 °C.",
        "Physics: The boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is 373.15 K, which is exactly 100 °C."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert Kelvin to Celsius?",
          "answer": "The official formula is °C = K - 273.15. To convert from Kelvin to Celsius, you simply subtract 273.15."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is it 'kelvin' and not 'degrees Kelvin'?",
          "answer": "The kelvin is an absolute unit of measure, where 0 K is absolute zero. Unlike Celsius or Fahrenheit, it is not referenced against a substance's properties and therefore does not use 'degrees'. This was established by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is absolute zero?",
          "answer": "Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, defined as 0 K on the Kelvin scale, which corresponds to -273.15 °C. At this temperature, particles cease to have thermal energy."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can Kelvin temperatures be negative?",
          "answer": "No, the Kelvin scale is an absolute scale that starts at 0 K (absolute zero). Therefore, negative Kelvin values are not possible."
