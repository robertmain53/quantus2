    "introduction": [
      "Enter a kilopascal value and get the PSI equivalent instantly, using the same ratio cited by NIST so mechanics, lab staff, and cooks can trust the number.",
      "We keep the interface lean while highlighting calibration and gauge limits so you can apply the conversion to tires, hydraulics, lab protocols, or pressure-cooker recipes without second-guessing precision.",
      "Safety reminders point you to the manufacturer’s specs and OSHA-style guidance whenever pressures approach regulated ranges."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We multiply kPa by 0.1450377377, the NIST-recognized constant derived from the SI definition of the pascal (1 kPa = 100,000 Pa) and the inch-pound definition of PSI (1 lbf per square inch).",
      "Because pressure is force over area, the factor is linear and reversible: 1 psi = 6.894757293 kPa. Rounding happens only for display; internal math keeps full precision.",
      "Gauge versus absolute: the numeric factor is the same, but your reference point changes. For compliance or calibrated work, note whether your instrument reports gauge or absolute and adjust for atmospheric pressure when needed."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "101.325 kPa (standard atmosphere) converts to 14.6959 psi for quick reference in aviation and lab exercises.",
      "220 kPa returns 31.91 psi, matching common passenger car tire placards.",
      "1000 kPa converts to 145.04 psi, useful for industrial and hydraulic setpoints."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does this converter use 0.1450377377?",
        "answer": "That is the NIST-backed ratio linking SI pascals to PSI. Using the exact factor keeps conversions reversible and consistent with engineering handbooks and university fluid mechanics courses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for lab or compliance use?",
        "answer": "Yes, as a reference. Always pair the converted number with your gauge’s calibration tolerance and follow OSHA or ISO documentation for regulated equipment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the tool handle vacuum readings?",
        "answer": "It blocks negative inputs because it assumes gauge pressure. For vacuum or absolute measurements below atmospheric, use a tool designed for absolute pressure and adjust for ambient conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from psi to kPa?",
        "answer": "Yes. Divide psi by 0.1450377377, or use our psi-to-kPa converter for a one-click reverse calculation."
