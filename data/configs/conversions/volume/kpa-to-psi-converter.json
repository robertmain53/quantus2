      "intro_markdown": "This kPa to PSI converter lets you translate pressures between the SI unit kilopascal (kPa) and the widely used pound per square inch (psi). It is designed for:\n\n- technicians checking tire or hydraulic pressures,\n- lab staff working with manometers, autoclaves, or pressure vessels,\n- cooks following pressure-cooker recipes written in psi, and\n- students learning how SI and Imperial pressure units relate.\n\nThe tool is built around the exact SI definition of the pascal, as maintained by the International System of Units and documented by national metrology institutes such as NIST in the United States.",
      "how_to_use_markdown": "1. Enter a value in **kilopascals (kPa)**. The converter instantly returns the equivalent **psi**.\n2. Use the **swap** button if you prefer to start from psi and convert to kPa.\n3. Adjust the number of decimal places if your instrument requires more or less precision.\n4. Compare the result against your instrument’s range and tolerance as specified in the manufacturer’s documentation.",
      "formula_markdown": "### kPa to psi formula\n\nThe conversion between kilopascals and pounds per square inch is linear. Using the widely adopted engineering constant:\n\n- `1 psi = 6.8947572932 kPa`\n- `1 kPa = 0.1450377377 psi`\n\nSo to convert:\n\n- **kPa → psi**: `psi = kPa × 0.1450377377`\n- **psi → kPa**: `kPa = psi × 6.8947572932`\n\nThese factors are consistent with pressure relationships found in university engineering handbooks and metrology references from national laboratories.",
      "worked_examples_markdown": "### Worked examples\n\n**Example 1 – Lab gauge calibration**\n\nA pressure gauge on a small reactor shows **250 kPa**. What is this in psi?\n\n1. Start from the formula `psi = kPa × 0.1450377377`.\n2. Compute: `250 × 0.1450377377 ≈ 36.259 psi`.\n3. With three significant figures appropriate for many industrial gauges, you can report **36.3 psi**.\n\n**Example 2 – Car tire pressure**\n\nYour car manual specifies **32 psi** for tire pressure, but the air pump at the station reads in kPa.\n\n1. Use `kPa = psi × 6.8947572932`.\n2. Compute: `32 × 6.8947572932 ≈ 220.6 kPa`.\n3. Setting the pump to around **221 kPa** matches the recommended 32 psi.\n\n**Example 3 – Pressure cooker recipe**\n\nA recipe calls for cooking beans at **15 psi**. Your electric pressure cooker displays kPa.\n\n1. Convert 15 psi to kPa: `15 × 6.8947572932 ≈ 103.4 kPa`.\n2. Set the cooker to the closest setting around **103 kPa** or select the preset that corresponds to 15 psi, following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
      "safety_markdown": "### Safety, calibration, and instrument limits\n\n- **Laboratory and clinical devices** – Autoclaves, manometers, and pressure transducers are usually calibrated in kPa or bar, with documentation referencing SI units and safety limits. Always verify pressure limits and calibration intervals against the device manual and relevant safety standards.\n\n- **Industrial and HVAC systems** – Many compressed air and refrigeration systems specify operating ranges in psi, while design documents use kPa or MPa. Treat this converter as a support tool; compliance must follow official design data, pressure vessel codes, and workplace safety guidance (for example, national occupational safety regulations).\n\n- **Automotive** – Tire sidewalls often show maximum cold inflation in both kPa and psi. Use the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended pressure (usually in the owner’s manual) rather than the tire’s maximum rating.\n\n- **Home and cooking** – For pressure cookers and other kitchen devices, always stay within the pressure range specified by the manufacturer. This converter helps with unit translation only; it does not override safety lock mechanisms, relief valves, or recipe guidelines.\n\nIf you need traceable measurements, follow your organisation’s calibration procedures and refer to metrology guidance from institutions such as national standards laboratories or university engineering departments.",
      "eeat_markdown": "### Methodology and reliability\n\n- **Standards-based units** – The pascal and kilopascal are defined within the International System of Units (SI) using the newton and metre. The conversion factor to psi used here matches values adopted in engineering handbooks and university fluid mechanics courses.\n- **Numerical treatment** – The calculator uses high-precision floating-point arithmetic internally and rounds only for display. For most users, the limiting factor in accuracy will be the instrument (gauge, sensor, or pressure cooker) rather than the conversion constant.\n- **Intended use** – This tool is suitable for educational, laboratory, and everyday engineering purposes. For regulatory reporting, formal certification, or safety-critical design, rely on your organisation’s approved software and documented procedures, using this converter as a quick cross-check.",
      "faq": [
        {
          "question": "How do you convert kPa to psi?",
          "answer": "Multiply the pressure value in kilopascals by 0.1450377377. For example, 200 kPa × 0.1450377377 ≈ 29.0 psi. The converter applies this factor automatically and lets you adjust the number of decimal places shown."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you convert psi to kPa?",
          "answer": "Multiply the pressure value in psi by 6.8947572932. For instance, 30 psi × 6.8947572932 ≈ 206.8 kPa. If you type 30 psi into the psi field and swap directions, the calculator will return the equivalent in kPa."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is kPa or psi more accurate?",
          "answer": "Neither unit is inherently more accurate; accuracy depends on your measuring device and calibration. Using kPa aligns with the SI system and is standard in scientific and many engineering contexts, while psi remains common in automotive, HVAC, and industrial settings."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use this converter for autoclave or lab equipment settings?",
          "answer": "Yes, the converter uses high-precision constants appropriate for laboratory work. However, always compare the converted value with the ranges, tolerances, and safety limits specified in your instrument manual and any applicable laboratory or workplace safety guidelines."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this calculator suitable for pressure cooker recipes?",
          "answer": "Yes. Many recipes specify 10–15 psi as the operating range. If your cooker displays kPa, you can convert the recipe’s psi to kPa here and then set your cooker to the closest safe setting, following the manufacturer’s instructions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What level of precision does the tool use?",
          "answer": "Internally the converter uses the full precision of the standard conversion factors (1 psi = 6.8947572932 kPa). Results are rounded only for display, and you can typically show 3–6 decimal places, which is more precise than most consumer gauges."
