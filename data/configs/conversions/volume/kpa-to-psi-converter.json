"• Compressed gases: OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101 and related guidance from university Environmental Health & Safety offices define how compressed gas cylinders are classified, stored, and inspected. Many of these documents still reference psi, while modern specifications for regulators, piping, and relief devices are often given in kPa.",
"• Cylinders and regulators: Typical cylinders and regulators carry maximum working pressures expressed in both kPa (or bar) and psi. Our converter helps you interpret labels and datasheets, but you must never exceed the lowest rated value across the system.",
"• Laboratory equipment: Autoclaves, reactors, and pressure vessels specify allowed operating ranges, often in kPa or bar with psi equivalents in the manual. Always treat any converted value as an approximation and follow the manufacturer limits as the source of truth.",
"• Calibration: For QA/QC in labs and plants, pressure gauges and transmitters are often calibrated against NIST-traceable standards. Where possible, use calibration certificates and documentation from accredited labs rather than hand-typed conversions.",
"For high-consequence scenarios (compressed oxygen, acetylene, high-pressure steam, or process gases), treat this converter as a design and documentation aid, not as a substitute for formal engineering calculations or safety reviews."

"• Espresso and beverage systems: Pump pressures may be specified in bar or kPa; some service documents reference psi. Using a consistent kPa ⇄ psi converter helps with maintenance logs and troubleshooting.",

"faq": [
{
"id": "what-is-kpa",
"question": "What is a kilopascal (kPa) in simple terms?",
"answer": "A kilopascal (kPa) is a metric unit of pressure equal to 1000 pascals (Pa). One pascal is one newton of force acting on one square metre of area. Kilopascals are widely used for tire pressure, hydraulics, HVAC systems, and lab instruments because they fit typical engineering ranges better than single pascals. NIST and international metrology institutes treat the pascal as the coherent SI unit of pressure, with kPa as a convenient multiple.",
"anchor": "faq-what-is-kpa"
},
{
"id": "what-is-psi",
"question": "What is pounds per square inch (psi)?",
"answer": "Pounds per square inch (psi) is a non-SI unit of pressure used primarily in the United States and in older equipment specifications. It represents one pound-force distributed over one square inch of area. You still see psi for tire pressure, compressed gas cylinders, hydraulic systems, and legacy process equipment. Many universities and engineering courses present both kPa and psi in worked examples to help students bridge between SI and inch-pound systems.",
"anchor": "faq-what-is-psi"
},
{
"id": "formula-kpa-to-psi",
"question": "What is the exact formula to convert kPa to psi?",
"answer": "The converter uses the NIST-consistent relationship between SI and inch-pound units. The formula is: psi = kPa × 0.1450377377. The inverse formula is kPa = psi × 6.894757293. These factors are aligned with NIST conversion tables and are widely used in engineering textbooks and university lecture notes.",
"anchor": "faq-formula-kpa-to-psi"
},
{
"id": "gauge-vs-absolute",
"question": "Does this calculator use gauge pressure or absolute pressure?",
"answer": "The conversion between kPa and psi is the same for gauge and absolute pressures: only the reference point changes. If your instrument or datasheet says kPa(g) and psi(g), you can convert numerically between them with the same factors. What you must not do is mix a gauge value with an absolute value without adjusting for atmospheric pressure (roughly 100–101 kPa or about 14.7 psi at sea level). For safety and design, always read whether the document is using gauge, absolute, or differential pressure.",
"anchor": "faq-gauge-vs-absolute"
},
{
"id": "safety-limits",
"question": "Can I use this to decide whether a pressure is safe for my cylinder or vessel?",
"answer": "No. This calculator only performs unit conversion. Whether a given pressure is safe depends on the design code, material, temperature, corrosion allowance, and safety factors of your system. For compressed gas cylinders and pressure vessels, rely on the manufacturer nameplate, certified design documents, and standards such as ASME codes and OSHA requirements. Use this tool to translate units when reading those documents, not to override them.",
"anchor": "faq-safety-limits"
},
{
"id": "recipes-and-autoclaves",
"question": "Is this kPa to psi converter suitable for recipes and autoclave cycles?",
"answer": "Yes, as long as you use it as a numeric aid and still follow validated time–temperature–pressure combinations. Some high-end cooking and microbiology texts specify pressure in kPa above atmospheric, while equipment manuals may use psi or bar. Converting consistently between kPa and psi reduces mistakes when you are configuring a pressure cooker, autoclave, or other sealed vessel. Always stay within the device's rated pressure range and follow food safety or biosafety guidance from trusted authorities or your institution.",
"anchor": "faq-recipes-autoclaves"
},
{
"id": "calibration",
"question": "How should I document kPa and psi when calibrating gauges and sensors?",
"answer": "Best practice in labs and industrial plants is to record both the nominal pressure and the unit, and where possible, reference a NIST-traceable standard or accredited calibration lab. Many calibration certificates list points in kPa, bar, and psi. Using a single, well-documented conversion factor (such as the one used in this calculator) helps keep your calibration sheets consistent with standards from NIST, national metrology institutes, and university reference materials."
