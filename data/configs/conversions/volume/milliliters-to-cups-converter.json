    "introduction": [
      "UnitConverters (01-convert-ml-to-cups.mhtml) and ConvertUnits (08-convert-ml-to-cups-conversion-of-measurement-units.mhtml) offer instant swaps but leave people wondering how the SI liter anchors the US cup, so we pair their speed with a compact primer on why this measurement exists and how it is defined by statute.",
      "OmniCalculator (02-ml-to-cups-converter.mhtml) and Flexi Answers (09-flexi-answers-convert-1-milliliter-to-cups.mhtml) show slick widgets but skip validation cues, so we add friendly reminders about calibration, tolerances, and when to double-check for regulated recipes, lab reagents, or customs filings.",
      "The experience stays lean while keeping undo/entry state obvious and gently pointing high-stakes users to certified instruments and standard measuring cups so both everyday cooks and professionals trust the result."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We route every conversion through the SI liter (one cubic decimeter) defined by the BIPM and then apply the NIST-sanctioned ratio that ties one US customary cup to exactly 236.5882365 milliliters (eight fluid ounces, 231 cubic inches).",
      "Our shared lib/conversions.ts entry holds that exact factor so the frontend always matches international unit law and the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 101.9) requirement that ties fluid ounces to the cup.",
      "Inline messaging highlights when rounding, device calibration, or regulated batches matter, directing readers toward standards documentation instead of treating this tool as a certification."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Entering 250 mL returns 1.06 cup immediately, letting pastry chefs confirm their metric mixing bowls match the US cup they already trust.",
      "A lab technician double-checking a 5 mL buffer aliquot sees 0.021 cup so the pipette calibration can be compared in both units before recording the result."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this converter use the US customary cup or the metric cup?",
        "answer": "We use the US customary cup defined by NIST and 21 CFR 101.9 (eight fluid ounces, 231 cubic inches); for the 250 mL metric cup see our cups-to-milliliters calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for dosing, lab reagents, or shipping paperwork?",
        "answer": "It provides government-grade constants for quick checks but is not a certification, so always confirm with calibrated instruments or the agency that issued the requirement before filing anything binding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why not just multiply by 0.24 instead of the longer factor?",
        "answer": "Rounded proxies degrade precision and reversibility, so we use the exact 236.5882365 mL per cup value embedded in lib/conversions.ts to keep conversions consistent and tolerance warnings actionable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I enter a very small or very large milliliter value?",
        "answer": "The UI stays responsive but we remind you that values under a tablespoon or above a few liters are clearer when expressed in tablespoons or gallons and may require recalibrating your measuring device for accuracy."
