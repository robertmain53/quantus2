    "introduction": [
      "Clear milliliter-to-cup conversions should move beyond a bare result by reminding people where the units come from, so we explain how the SI liter anchors the US customary cup and why that matters for recipes, labs, and shipments.",
      "The converter keeps the interaction lean but adds contextual nudges about calibration and rounding tolerance, so casual cooks and regulated teams know when to trust the number and when to verify instruments before acting.",
      "We display precise outcomes while surfacing undo/entry cues and trusted references so every visitor ends the session confident in the result and the underlying definitions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We route every conversion through the SI liter (one cubic decimeter) defined by the BIPM and then apply the chain of constants that tie that liter to a US customary cup, ensuring the tool honors the same definitions used by labs, shipper, and food labelers.",
      "One US customary cup equals 8 US fluid ounces, 231 cubic inches, or exactly 236.5882365 milliliters; dividing the input by that value (or multiplying by 0.0042267528377) gives the rounded cup result so the equation stays reversible and aligned with lib/conversions.ts rather than the vague length-chain example shown in mtc.pdf.",
      "Inline messaging highlights when rounding, device calibration, or regulated batches matter, nudging readers toward the cited standards instead of treating this tool as a certification."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Entering 250 mL returns 1.0567 cup immediately, letting pastry chefs confirm their metric mixing bowls match the US cup they already trust and showing exactly how we round for ingredient scaling.",
      "A lab technician double-checking a 5 mL buffer aliquot sees 0.021 cup so the pipette calibration can be compared in both units before recording the result."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this converter use the US customary cup or the metric cup?",
        "answer": "We use the US customary cup defined by NIST and 21 CFR 101.9 (eight fluid ounces, 231 cubic inches); for the 250 mL metric cup see our cups-to-milliliters calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for dosing, lab reagents, or shipping paperwork?",
        "answer": "It provides government-grade constants for quick checks but is not a certification, so always confirm with calibrated instruments or the agency that issued the requirement before filing anything binding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why not just multiply by 0.24 instead of the longer factor?",
        "answer": "Rounded proxies degrade precision and reversibility, so we use the exact 236.5882365 mL per cup value embedded in lib/conversions.ts to keep conversions consistent and tolerance warnings actionable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I enter a very small or very large milliliter value?",
        "answer": "The UI stays responsive but we remind you that values under a tablespoon or above a few liters are clearer when expressed in tablespoons or gallons and may require recalibrating your measuring device for accuracy."
