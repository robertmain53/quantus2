    "introduction": [
      "We deliver conversions anchored to the BIPM liter and the NIST-sanctioned US customary cup so the public and professionals see the same constants used in labs and regulatory labels.",
      "Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Nutrition Source reminds us that accurate portions start with precise measuring cups, while USDA FoodData Central keeps nutrient data consistent by using the same milliliter totals we surface here.",
      "The widget stays uncluttered but layers in rounding, calibration, and compliance cues so cooks, dietitians, and lab teams can trust every result before scaling or logging it."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Every input converts via the SI liter (one cubic decimeter) and multiplies by 236.5882365 milliliters per US cup, keeping the engine aligned with BIPM definitions and that sanctioned NIST conversion factor so reversibility and precision stay intact.",
      "Federal rules such as eCFR Title 21 §101.9 tie the fluid ounce-to-cup chain (eight ounces, 231 cubic inches) that food labels and shipper declarations must obey, so we spell out that relationship to make regulatory users confident in the math.",
      "Inline reminders point to USDA FoodData Central’s guidance on consistent portion tracking and clarify when device calibration or rounding tolerance matters, ensuring the calculator stays useful for both recipe prep and regulated dosing."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Converting 1 US customary cup returns 236.588 mL, a quick sanity check for bakers following Harvard’s portion-size primers.",
      "Scaling a 0.5 cup pour shows 118.294 mL so beverage labs and service teams can compare their jiggers or pipettes against the precise metric value."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which cup definition does this tool use?",
        "answer": "We rely on the US customary cup defined by NIST and eCFR Title 21 §101.9; a metric cup (250 mL) follows a different standard so use our reverse milliliters-to-cups converter for that scenario."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this accurate enough for regulated recipes or lab dosing?",
        "answer": "Because the calculator uses BIPM and NIST constants, a calibrated instrument will recover the same digits; still, verify with your certified measuring cups or pipettes before filing paperwork or finalizing a yield."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why mention USDA FoodData Central and Harvard’s Nutrition Source?",
        "answer": "Those academic and government programs show why portion tracking depends on consistent milliliter totals, so our copy stays aligned with the same practices they teach."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert to milliliters and back to cups without losing precision?",
        "answer": "Yes, the 236.5882365 factor is reversible—multiply to go to metric and divide to return—but we recommend rounding only after checking your measurement tool’s calibration tolerance."
