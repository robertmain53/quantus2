    "introduction": [
      "Convert cubic meters to liters instantly with the exact 1,000:1 SI definition so recipes, lab prep, and industrial volume checks stay consistent.",
      "The calculator handles fractional inputs cleanly, making it reliable for tank sizing, solution prep, or scaling kitchen and beverage batches.",
      "Clear labeling keeps the conversion audit-friendly for procurement specs and compliance documentation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The liter is defined as 1 cubic decimeter, and 1 cubic meter equals 1,000 liters per SI conventions (NIST SI Guide, ISO 80000-1).",
      "The calculator multiplies cubic meters by 1,000 to return liters; no rounding is applied beyond display formatting.",
      "For regulated contexts (lab, food, or water reporting), record the unit and the unrounded value, following NIST and ISO guidance."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.75 m³ → 750 liters, useful for beverage batch planning.",
      "2.4 m³ → 2,400 liters for small tank sizing.",
      "0.015 m³ → 15 liters, handy for lab solution prep."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the 1,000:1 ratio exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By SI definition, 1 cubic meter is exactly 1,000 liters (1 liter = 1 cubic decimeter)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I enter fractional cubic meters?",
        "answer": "Yes. Any decimal input is multiplied by 1,000 to return liters, useful for precise lab or recipe scaling."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to consider temperature for volume?",
        "answer": "For most general and recipe uses, no. For high-precision lab or custody transfer work, note that liquids expand with temperature; record conditions if required by your protocol."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document the result?",
        "answer": "Include the numeric value, unit (L), and if needed the source definition (1 m³ = 1,000 L per SI) in your notes or compliance records."
