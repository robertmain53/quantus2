    "introduction": [
      "Convert minutes to hours instantly for scheduling, billing, workouts, or lab intervals without manual math.",
      "The converter uses the exact 60:1 minute-to-hour definition maintained by NIST and ISO so your logs, tickets, and reports stay consistent across tools.",
      "Fractional-minute support and clear labeling make it easy to sanity-check durations before you publish, invoice, or submit compliance paperwork."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Time units follow SI-derived guidance: 1 hour is defined as 60 minutes and 3600 seconds, with the second tied to the cesium standard (NIST, BIPM).",
      "The calculator divides the entered minutes by 60 to return hours, matching ISO 80000-3 unit conventions used in science, aviation, and regulated reporting.",
      "For accuracy in audits or invoices, note the input source and confirm timers or systems are aligned to the same unit scheme per NIST Time and Frequency best practices."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "90 minutes → 1.5 hours, useful for meeting or workout blocks.",
      "45 minutes → 0.75 hours for billing increments.",
      "600 minutes → 10 hours to verify a lab instrument runtime limit."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the 60:1 minute-to-hour ratio exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition, 60 minutes equals 1 hour and 3600 seconds per NIST and ISO time standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I enter fractional minutes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Any decimal minutes are divided by 60 to return fractional hours, helpful for billing or scheduling."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds adjust UTC occasionally but do not change the exact 60:1 relationship between minutes and hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document this in reports or invoices?",
        "answer": "Record both the numeric value and unit (hours) and note that the SI-derived 60:1 relationship was applied for clarity and compliance."
