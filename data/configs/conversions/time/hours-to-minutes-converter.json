    "introduction": [
      "Convert hours to minutes instantly for scheduling, shift planning, billing, or experiment timing without manual math.",
      "This tool uses the exact 60:1 hour-to-minute definition maintained by NIST and ISO so your logs and reports stay consistent across devices and standards.",
      "Clear labels and fractional-hour support make it easy to double-check durations before you publish, invoice, or submit compliance paperwork."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Time units follow SI-derived guidance: 1 hour is defined as 60 minutes, with the minute defined as 60 seconds and the second tied to the cesium standard (NIST, BIPM).",
      "The calculator multiplies the entered hours by 60 to return minutes, matching ISO 80000-3 unit conventions used in science, aviation, and regulated reporting.",
      "For accuracy in audits or invoices, note the input hours source and confirm your timers or systems are aligned to the same unit scheme per NIST Time and Frequency best practices."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2.5 hours → 150 minutes for a client billing block.",
      "0.75 hours → 45 minutes to set a meeting invite.",
      "10 hours → 600 minutes for a lab instrument runtime limit."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the 60:1 hour-to-minute ratio exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition, 1 hour equals exactly 60 minutes and 3600 seconds per NIST and ISO time standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I enter fractional hours?",
        "answer": "Yes. Fractions like 1.25 hours are multiplied by 60 to give 75 minutes, useful for billing or scheduling."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds adjust UTC clocks occasionally but do not change the exact 60:1 relationship between hours and minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document this in reports or invoices?",
        "answer": "Record both the numeric value and unit (minutes) and note that the SI-derived 60:1 relationship was applied for transparency."
