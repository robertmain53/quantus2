    "introduction": [
      "Convert seconds to minutes instantly for schedules, workouts, media edits, or lab intervals without manual math.",
      "The converter uses the exact 60:1 second-to-minute definition maintained by NIST and ISO so your logs, tickets, and reports stay consistent across devices.",
      "Clear labels and fractional-second support make it easy to sanity-check timers before you publish, invoice, or file compliance paperwork."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Time units follow SI-derived guidance: 1 minute is defined as 60 seconds, with the second tied to the cesium standard (NIST, BIPM).",
      "The calculator divides the entered seconds by 60 to return minutes, matching ISO 80000-3 unit conventions used in science, aviation, and broadcast timing.",
      "For accuracy in audits or invoices, note the input source and confirm your timers or systems are aligned to the same unit scheme per NIST Time and Frequency best practices."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "90 seconds → 1.5 minutes, useful for interval training or cue sheets.",
      "15 seconds → 0.25 minutes, handy for audio clip trims or lab timers.",
      "3600 seconds → 60 minutes to check hour-long run logs."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the 60:1 second-to-minute ratio exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition, 60 seconds equals 1 minute per NIST and ISO time standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I enter fractional seconds?",
        "answer": "Yes. Fractional seconds are divided by 60 to return fractional minutes, useful for audio edits and lab measurements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds adjust UTC clocks occasionally but do not change the exact 60:1 relationship between seconds and minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document this in reports or invoices?",
        "answer": "Record both the numeric value and unit (minutes) and note that the SI-derived 60:1 relationship was applied for clarity and compliance."
