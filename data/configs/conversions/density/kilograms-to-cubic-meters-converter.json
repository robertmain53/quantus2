    "introduction": [
      "Convert kilograms to cubic meters in one step by applying the density of your material, keeping tank sizing, batching, and lab prep consistent with SI units.",
      "Density is editable so you can handle water, fuels, slurries, aggregates, or any lab sample without separate tools.",
      "We surface both m³ and liters to make procurement and reporting straightforward."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Volume = Mass ÷ Density. With SI units, kg divided by kg/m³ yields m³ directly, per NIST SI guidance and ISO 80000-1 conventions.",
      "A secondary output multiplies the m³ result by 1,000 to provide liters for purchasing, labeling, or batch tickets.",
      "For accurate results, use a density measured at the temperature and composition relevant to your process, following lab QA/QC practices."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000 kg of water (density 1000 kg/m³) → 1.0 m³ and 1,000 L.",
      "2,400 kg of concrete mix (density 2400 kg/m³) → 1.0 m³ and 1,000 L.",
      "800 kg of diesel (density 830 kg/m³) → ~0.964 m³ and 964 L."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What density should I use?",
        "answer": "Use the material’s density at your operating temperature. Typical values: water ~1000 kg/m³ at 4 °C, diesel ~830 kg/m³, concrete ~2400 kg/m³. Manufacturer data or lab measurements are best."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The formula is exact; accuracy depends on the density you enter. The outputs follow SI unit rules (kg, m³, L)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do temperature or composition changes matter?",
        "answer": "Yes for many liquids and slurries. Note the measurement conditions and, if required, apply temperature-corrected density from your spec sheet."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why show liters as well as m³?",
        "answer": "Liters are common in procurement and labeling. Showing both units keeps lab, purchasing, and reporting teams aligned."
