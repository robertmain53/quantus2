    "introduction": [
      "Convert cubic meters to kilograms in one step by applying the density of your material, keeping tank sizing, batching, and lab prep aligned with SI units.",
      "Density is editable so you can handle water, fuels, slurries, aggregates, or any lab sample without switching tools.",
      "We surface both kilograms and metric tonnes so procurement and reporting stay consistent."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Mass = Volume × Density. With SI units, m³ multiplied by kg/m³ yields kg directly, per NIST SI guidance and ISO 80000-1 conventions.",
      "A secondary output divides kg by 1,000 to provide metric tonnes for logistics and purchasing.",
      "For accurate results, use a density measured at the temperature and composition relevant to your process, following lab QA/QC practices."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1.0 m³ of water (density 1000 kg/m³) → 1,000 kg and 1.0 t.",
      "0.5 m³ of diesel (density 830 kg/m³) → 415 kg and 0.415 t.",
      "2.0 m³ of concrete mix (density 2400 kg/m³) → 4,800 kg and 4.8 t."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What density should I use?",
        "answer": "Use the material’s density at your operating temperature. Typical values: water ~1000 kg/m³ at 4 °C, diesel ~830 kg/m³, concrete ~2400 kg/m³. Manufacturer data or lab measurements are best."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The formula is exact; accuracy depends on the density you enter. The outputs follow SI unit rules (m³, kg, t)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do temperature or composition changes matter?",
        "answer": "Yes for many liquids and slurries. Note the measurement conditions and, if required, apply temperature-corrected density from your spec sheet."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why show tonnes as well as kilograms?",
        "answer": "Tonnes are common in logistics and purchasing. Showing both units keeps lab, procurement, and reporting teams aligned."
