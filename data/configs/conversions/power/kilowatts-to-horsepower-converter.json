    "introduction": [
      "Enter kilowatts to get the mechanical horsepower equivalent using the standard 1 kW = 1.34102209 hp factor.",
      "Built for motors, engines, lab equipment, and even high-power kitchen gear where specs switch between kW and hp.",
      "We keep the UI lean while reminding you that nameplates may list electrical input, not mechanical output."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Mechanical horsepower is treated as approximately 745.7 W; inverting gives 1 kW = 1.34102209 hp, the multiplier used here.",
      "The factor aligns with NIST conversion tables and ISO 80000 power definitions; rounding is only for display.",
      "If you need metric horsepower (PS/CV), multiply kW by about 1.36; this tool reports mechanical hp."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.75 kW → 1.01 hp for a small lab stirrer or mixer.",
      "2.2 kW → 2.95 hp for a common pump motor, often marketed as 3 hp.",
      "10 kW → 13.41 hp to contextualize high-power appliances or light industrial drives."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which horsepower definition is used?",
        "answer": "Mechanical horsepower (~745.7 W). If you need metric horsepower (PS/CV), multiply kW by roughly 1.36 instead."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might hp differ from the nameplate?",
        "answer": "Some nameplates list electrical input kW, not mechanical output. Efficiency, duty cycle, and test conditions affect rated hp even though the unit conversion is fixed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the factor?",
        "answer": "Using 1.34102209 keeps reversibility with NIST/ISO constants. For typical sizing, 3–4 significant figures are sufficient; align rounding with your measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back to kW?",
        "answer": "Yes—multiply hp by 0.745699872 (or divide by 1.34102209) to recover kilowatts, or use the companion hp-to-kW converter."
