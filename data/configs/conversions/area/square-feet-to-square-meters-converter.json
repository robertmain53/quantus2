      "introduction": [
        "This square feet to square meters converter provides scientifically accurate results for professionals in real estate, engineering, and international trade.",
        "Every calculation uses the exact formula based on the international foot (1 ft = 0.3048 m), ensuring your area conversions are precise for floor plans, land deeds, and material specifications.",
        "We provide the official formula, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert square feet to square meters with confidence and avoid errors from using inexact approximations."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert square feet (ft²) to square meters (m²), the calculator multiplies the square foot value by exactly 0.09290304.",
        "This conversion factor is derived from the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement, which defined the international foot as exactly 0.3048 meters. Squaring this value (0.3048 × 0.3048) gives the exact area in square meters for one square foot.",
        "This standard is recognized by metrology institutions worldwide, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ensuring global consistency for all modern applications."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Real Estate: A 2,000 ft² home in the United States is equivalent to approximately 185.8 m², a crucial detail for international property listings.",
        "Construction: A project requiring 500 ft² of a specific material from a European supplier would need to be ordered as 46.45 m².",
        "Scientific Research: A laboratory space specified as 1,200 ft² is documented as 111.48 m² in scientific papers for international publication."

        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert square feet to square meters?",
          "answer": "The official formula is: Square Meters = Square Feet × 0.09290304. This is an exact definition based on the international foot."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many square meters are in a square foot?",
          "answer": "There are exactly 0.09290304 square meters in one square foot. For a quick estimate, you can divide the square feet by 10.764."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this conversion different from the U.S. survey foot?",
          "answer": "Yes. This calculator uses the international foot (0.3048 m). The U.S. survey foot was a slightly different historical measure that was officially deprecated by NIST in 2023. The international foot is the standard for all modern area calculations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use this to convert cubic feet to cubic meters?",
          "answer": "No, this calculator is for two-dimensional area. For three-dimensional volume, you need a cubic feet to cubic meters converter, which uses a different formula (cubic meters = cubic feet × 0.028316846592)."
