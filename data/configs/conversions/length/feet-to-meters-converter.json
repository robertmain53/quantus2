      "introduction": [
        "This feet to meters converter provides engineering-grade precision for professionals in surveying, construction, and international trade.",
        "It strictly adheres to the international standard where 1 foot equals exactly 0.3048 meters, ensuring your calculations align with global and federal specifications.",
        "Avoid costly errors by understanding the context around the now-deprecated U.S. survey foot and confidently translate imperial measurements for any modern project."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The conversion is based on the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959, which defined the international foot as exactly 0.3048 meters. [1, 2]",
        "Our engine multiplies any value in feet by this exact constant, providing a result that is traceable to standards maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).",
        "We explicitly avoid the U.S. survey foot (approximately 0.30480061 meters), which was officially deprecated by NIST and NOAA on December 31, 2022, to prevent discrepancies in large-scale mapping and engineering projects. [3, 4]"
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Architectural Plan: A building facade measuring 150.5 feet is converted to 45.8724 meters for an international materials supplier.",
        "Aviation: A runway length of 10,000 feet is equal to 3048 meters, a critical specification for aircraft performance calculations.",
        "Land Surveying: A property line of 550 feet is recorded as 167.64 meters to align with modern GIS and state plane coordinate systems."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert feet to meters?",
          "answer": "The exact formula is: meters = feet × 0.3048. This is the official factor for the international foot, which is the current global standard. [1]"
        },
        {
          "question": "Does this calculator use the U.S. survey foot?",
          "answer": "No, this tool exclusively uses the international foot (0.3048 meters). The U.S. survey foot has been deprecated by NIST and should only be used for historical data. [3, 4]"
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is it important to distinguish between the international and U.S. survey foot?",
          "answer": "The difference is about 2 parts per million, which seems small but can lead to errors of several feet over large distances, critically impacting projects like bridges and state-wide surveys. [4]"
        },
        {
          "question": "How many decimal places are needed for accuracy?",
          "answer": "Our calculator provides high precision for technical applications. For most practical uses, rounding to three or four decimal places (e.g., 167.64 meters) is sufficient."
