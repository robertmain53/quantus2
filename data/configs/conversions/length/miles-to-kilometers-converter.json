      "introduction": [
        "This miles to kilometers converter provides exact, reliable results for professionals and individuals in travel, athletics, and international business.",
        "It operates on the official international standard where 1 mile is precisely 1.609344 kilometers, ensuring your conversions are accurate and traceable.",
        "With authoritative context on the underlying standards, you can confidently translate imperial distances to metric units for any application, from marathon training to vehicle specifications."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert miles to kilometers, the calculator multiplies the value in miles by exactly 1.609344. [1]",
        "This conversion factor is an exact definition, not an approximation, established by the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement, which defined the yard as 0.9144 meters.",
        "Since a mile is 1,760 yards, its length is exactly 1,609.344 meters, or 1.609344 kilometers. This standard is distinct from the nautical mile (1.852 km) used in maritime and aviation contexts. [2]"
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Athletics: A marathon distance of 26.2 miles is equivalent to approximately 42.16 kilometers.",
        "Automotive: A car with a fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon is equivalent to about 12.75 kilometers per liter.",
        "Travel: A 500-mile road trip covers a distance of 804.672 kilometers."

        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert miles to kilometers?",
          "answer": "The official formula is: kilometers = miles × 1.609344. This is an exact calculation based on the international definition of a mile. [1]"
        },
        {
          "question": "How many kilometers are in a mile?",
          "answer": "There are exactly 1.609344 kilometers in one international statute mile. This is the standard used for all land-based distance measurements."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is a nautical mile different from a standard mile?",
          "answer": "Yes. A standard (statute) mile is 1.609344 km. A nautical mile is longer, defined as exactly 1.852 kilometers, and is used for navigation in aviation and maritime settings. [2]"
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is using an exact conversion factor important?",
          "answer": "Using the exact factor is critical for scientific accuracy, engineering specifications, and international trade to prevent errors and ensure that measurements are consistent and interoperable across different systems."
