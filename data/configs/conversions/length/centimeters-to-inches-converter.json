      "introduction": [
        "This tool provides a precise conversion from centimeters to inches based on international standards.",
        "Accurate conversions are essential for a wide range of applications, from personal health tracking to scientific and engineering specifications.",
        "Our converter uses the globally recognized factor to ensure your results are reliable."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The conversion is based on the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, which defines one inch as exactly 2.54 centimeters.",
        "This standard is recognized by metrology institutions worldwide, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).",
        "To convert centimeters to inches, the value is multiplied by approximately 0.393701 (the reciprocal of 2.54).",
        "To then express this in feet and inches, divide the total inches by 12. The whole number is the feet, and the remainder is the inches."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "A height of 180 cm is equivalent to approximately 70.87 inches.",
        "A measurement of 75 cm converts to about 29.53 inches."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How accurate is this conversion?",
          "answer": "The calculation is based on the exact definition of an inch as 2.54 centimeters, making it as accurate as the measurement you provide."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I get feet and inches from the result?",
          "answer": "Take the total inches and divide by 12. For example, 70.87 inches is 5 feet (since 5 * 12 = 60) with a remainder of 10.87 inches. So, 5 ft 10.87 in."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this suitable for medical records?",
          "answer": "Yes. While many healthcare systems use metric units, converting to inches is common for patient communication. Always verify the required format for official records."
