    "introduction": [
      "This calculator provides a precise conversion from centimeters to the feet and inches format commonly used for height in the United States and other regions.",
      "Accurate conversions are critical for a range of applications, from tracking personal health and fitness goals to ensuring data integrity in medical records.",
      "Our tool uses the internationally accepted conversion factor to ensure your results are reliable and directly applicable."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, which defines one inch as exactly 2.54 centimeters.",
      "First, the input value in centimeters is converted to total inches by multiplying by the conversion factor of approximately 0.393701 (the reciprocal of 2.54).",
      "The total number of feet is calculated by dividing the total inches by 12 and taking the integer part of the result (the floor).",
      "The remaining inches are found using the modulo operator, which gives the remainder of the division of total inches by 12. This ensures the final output is in the standard 'feet and inches' format."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this conversion?",
        "answer": "This conversion is based on the exact definition of an inch as 2.54 centimeters, a standard adopted by international agreement in 1959. The calculation is therefore as accurate as the input measurement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are both feet and inches used for height?",
        "answer": "In the United States and some other countries, the imperial system is standard for everyday measurements like body height. Expressing height in feet and inches is a cultural and practical convention."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter suitable for medical records?",
        "answer": "Yes, while many healthcare systems are transitioning to metric-only records to prevent dosage errors, converting to feet and inches is often necessary for patient communication. Always verify the required unit format for official records."
