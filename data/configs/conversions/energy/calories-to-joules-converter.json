    "introduction": [
      "Convert calories or kilocalories to joules instantly with standards-based factors so lab notes, recipe cards, and training plans stay consistent with SI units.",
      "We anchor the tool to NIST and ISO definitions of the calorie and joule, add calibration cues from academic labs, and keep the interface lean for quick lookups.",
      "Both thermochemical calories and food kilocalories are supported so you can document energy anywhere—from bomb calorimeters to diet trackers."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The thermochemical calorie is defined as 4.184 joules; multiplying calories by 4.184 yields joules and dividing by 1000 yields kilojoules, matching NIST Special Publication 811 and ISO 80000-1 energy conventions.",
      "Nutrition and exercise commonly use kilocalories; multiplying kilocalories by 4184 produces joules and by 4.184 produces kilojoules, aligning with USDA FoodData Central and DOE energy education references.",
      "We emphasize SI coherence (joule as kg·m²/s²) and advise verifying calorimeter or sensor calibration per university lab manuals and OSHA lab safety guidance before relying on the converted value."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "A 75 cal lab sample releases 314 joules, suitable for reporting in a high-school or university calorimetry writeup.",
      "A protein bar labeled 250 kcal equals 1,046,000 joules (1,046 kJ), which matches EU nutrition panel requirements that display energy in kJ.",
      "A reaction step requiring 12.5 cal delivers about 52.3 joules, confirming the heat input is below a typical DSC instrument’s low-range limit."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "When should I use calories versus kilocalories?",
        "answer": "Small calories (cal) appear in chemistry and physics contexts, while food labels and metabolic studies use kilocalories (kcal). Select the method that matches your source data so the correct factor (4.184 J or 4184 J) is applied."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use 4.184 J instead of 4.1868 J?",
        "answer": "NIST and ISO standards round the thermochemical calorie to 4.184 J for SI coherence. The 4.1868 J factor is the older international steam-table value; most modern lab reports, journals, and regulators expect 4.184 J."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this precise enough for regulatory nutrition panels?",
        "answer": "Yes—multiplying kcal by 4.184 or 4184 yields kJ or J with the precision used on EU labels. Always round per the labeling rule you follow (e.g., to the nearest kJ for EU 1169/2011)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I confirm instrument accuracy before converting?",
        "answer": "Run a quick calibration check: verify your calorimeter or sensor against a reference sample or manufacturer standard, note the tolerance, and record it alongside the converted joule value per OSHA and university lab safety guidelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I reverse the calculation back to calories?",
        "answer": "Yes. Divide joules by 4.184 to get calories or by 4184 to get kilocalories, keeping the unit context consistent with your source data."
