    "introduction": [
      "Convert joules or kilojoules to calories and kilocalories instantly so lab notes, recipe cards, and training dashboards stay aligned with SI and labeling rules.",
      "We anchor every output to NIST and ISO definitions of the joule and thermochemical calorie, with calibration cues drawn from university lab practice and OSHA lab safety reminders.",
      "Both small calories and food kilocalories are shown together to remove ambiguity when copying values between scientific instruments and nutrition software."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The thermochemical calorie is defined as 4.184 joules; dividing joules by 4.184 yields calories and by 4184 yields kilocalories, matching NIST Special Publication 811 and ISO 80000-1 conventions.",
      "Kilojoules to kilocalories uses the same factor (1 kJ = 0.239006 kcal), consistent with USDA FoodData Central and DOE energy education guidance for labeling and training.",
      "We reinforce SI coherence (joule as kg·m^2/s^2) and recommend verifying calorimeter, wattmeter, or fitness sensor calibration per university lab manuals and OSHA laboratory safety guidelines before logging converted values."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5,000 J converts to about 1,195 cal (1.195 kcal), suitable for a high-school calorimetry report.",
      "1,200 kJ from a smart bike session converts to roughly 286.8 kcal for quick nutrition tracking.",
      "42,000 J from a DSC step equals about 10,039 cal, confirming the heat input stays within the instrument’s mid-range."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do you use 4.184 J per calorie?",
        "answer": "NIST and ISO standards fix the thermochemical calorie at 4.184 J for SI alignment; older steam-table values (4.1868 J) are rarely accepted in modern lab reporting or labeling."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between cal and kcal here?",
        "answer": "cal refers to the small thermochemical calorie common in physics and chemistry; kcal is 1000 cal and is used on food labels and fitness equipment. We show both so you can cite the right unit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this precise enough for regulatory nutrition panels?",
        "answer": "Yes. Converting kJ to kcal with the NIST factor matches the precision used in EU 1169/2011 and USDA FoodData Central. Round to the kJ or kcal increment required by your labeling rule."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle calibration or sensor drift?",
        "answer": "Before trusting a converted value, note the instrument’s tolerance: run a check against a reference sample (lab calorimeter), manufacturer test load (wattmeter), or built-in fitness calibration. Record that tolerance alongside the converted calories per OSHA and university lab guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I go back to joules from calories?",
        "answer": "Yes. Multiply calories by 4.184 to get joules, or multiply kilocalories by 4184 for joules, keeping the unit context consistent with your source."
