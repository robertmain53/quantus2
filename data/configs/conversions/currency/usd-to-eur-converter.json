    "introduction": [
      "Convert USD to EUR in one step with a rate field you control, ideal for travel budgets, invoices, and FX sanity checks.",
      "We anchor guidance to ECB reference rates and federal economic data, while giving you an explicit fee input to mirror bank or card spreads.",
      "Copy the gross and net euro values to keep quotes and audit trails transparent."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter multiplies your USD amount by the USD→EUR rate; we recommend using the ECB reference rate as a baseline and adjusting for your provider’s spread.",
      "An optional fee percent applies a single-point markdown: EUR_after_fee = USD × rate × (1 – fee/100), so you can model bank, broker, or card costs.",
      "Rates move intraday; note the timestamp and source (ECB, Federal Reserve H.10 / FRED DEXUSEU) when recording values for compliance or invoicing."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "$250 at 0.92 → €230.00 before fees; at a 1% fee it yields €227.70.",
      "$1,200 payroll reimbursement at 0.915 → €1,098.00 before any card spread.",
      "$50 travel cash at 0.90 with a 3% ATM fee → €43.65 after fee."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which rate should I use?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How often do rates change?",
        "answer": "Interbank rates move throughout the day. Refresh the rate field using your trusted source and note the time when logging or invoicing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why include a fee percent?",
        "answer": "Most providers add a spread. Applying a percent keeps quotes realistic and audit-ready compared to pure mid-market figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I remove the fee?",
        "answer": "Yes. Set the fee to 0 to see the mid-market conversion without spreads."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for compliance records?",
        "answer": "Yes, provided you record the rate source, timestamp, and any applied fee. ECB and Federal Reserve (H.10 / FRED DEXUSEU) are standard references."
