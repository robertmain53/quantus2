    "introduction": [
      "Convert EUR to GBP in one step with a controllable rate and fee, ideal for invoices, payroll reimbursements, and FX sanity checks.",
      "We anchor guidance to ECB/Bank of England reference data while giving you an explicit fee input to mirror bank or card spreads.",
      "Copy the gross and net pound values to keep quotes and audit trails transparent."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Multiply EUR by your EUR→GBP rate; use the ECB/BoE cross as a baseline and adjust for your provider’s spread.",
      "An optional fee percent applies a markdown: GBP_after_fee = EUR × rate × (1 – fee/100), reflecting common bank or card costs.",
      "Rates move intraday; record the source and timestamp (e.g., BoE reference, ECB cross, or FRED/IMF series) when logging for compliance or invoicing."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "€250 at 0.86 → £215.00 before fees; at a 1% fee it yields £212.85.",
      "€1,200 at 0.855 → £1,026.00 before any card spread.",
      "€50 travel cash at 0.84 with a 3% ATM fee → £40.74 after fee."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which rate should I use?",
        "answer": "Use the ECB/BoE reference as a neutral anchor, then adjust the fee field to reflect your bank, broker, or card spread."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do rates change?",
        "answer": "Interbank rates move throughout the day. Refresh the rate field from your trusted source and note the time when logging or invoicing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why include a fee percent?",
        "answer": "Most providers add a spread. Applying a percent keeps quotes realistic and audit-ready versus pure mid-market figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I remove the fee?",
        "answer": "Yes. Set the fee to 0 to see the mid-market conversion without spreads."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for compliance records?",
        "answer": "Yes—record the rate source, timestamp, and any applied fee. ECB/BoE reference rates, FRED, or IMF data are standard references."
