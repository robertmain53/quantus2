    "introduction": [
      "Convert megabytes to gigabytes or mebibytes to gibibytes instantly with standards-based factors so storage estimates match both packaging and operating-system readouts.",
      "We separate decimal (MB/GB) and binary (MiB/GiB) paths, anchored to NIST SI prefixes and IEC/ISO binary prefixes, to avoid surprises when comparing vendor specs, cloud billing, or OS free space.",
      "Brief helper text and dual outputs mirror what engineers, IT admins, and students expect when cross-checking capacities or transfer sizes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Decimal storage uses SI prefixes: 1 megabyte (MB) = 10^6 bytes and 1 gigabyte (GB) = 10^9 bytes, so MB to GB divides by 1000 in line with NIST SI guidance.",
      "Binary storage in operating systems follows IEC/ISO 80000-13 prefixes: 1 mebibyte (MiB) = 2^20 bytes and 1 gibibyte (GiB) = 2^30 bytes, so MiB to GiB divides by 1024.",
      "We recommend matching the method to your source: device packaging and cloud invoices use decimal, while OS disk utilities and many file systems use binary. For audit trails, note which prefix system you used, as advised in IEEE 1541 and university computing labs."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "750 MB (decimal) ÷ 1000 = 0.75 GB, matching what most drive packaging advertises.",
      "2048 MiB ÷ 1024 = 2 GiB, which aligns with operating-system disk usage readouts.",
      "120000 MB converts to 120 GB for a quick cloud storage budget check."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do MB and MiB give different answers?",
        "answer": "MB follows SI decimal prefixes (base 10), while MiB uses binary prefixes (base 2). Hardware labels and cloud billing typically use MB/GB; operating systems often report MiB/GiB."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method should I use for compliance or reporting?",
        "answer": "Match the prefix system used by your source data. Procurement and invoices rely on decimal MB/GB; technical troubleshooting and OS screenshots usually need binary MiB/GiB. Record the choice to keep audits clear."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are these conversions?",
        "answer": "They are exact by definition: divide by 1000 for MB→GB and by 1024 for MiB→GiB. Rounding in the UI is only for readability; underlying values retain full precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will network transfer tools use MB or MiB?",
        "answer": "Command-line tools vary: some report MB/s (decimal), others MiB/s (binary). Check the tool’s manual; the same factor choice applies when converting to GB or GiB."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from GB to MB?",
        "answer": "Yes. Multiply decimal GB by 1000 to get MB, or multiply GiB by 1024 to get MiB, keeping the prefix system consistent."
