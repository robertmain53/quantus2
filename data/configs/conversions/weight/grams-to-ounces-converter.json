      "introduction": [
        "This grams to ounces converter provides precise results based on the international standard, making it a reliable tool for culinary professionals, scientists, and anyone needing accurate weight conversions.",
        "Every calculation uses the official relationship where 1 ounce is defined as exactly 28.349523125 grams, ensuring your conversions are accurate for recipes, shipping weights, and scientific data.",
        "We provide the official formula, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert grams to ounces with confidence and avoid common rounding errors found in less precise tools."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert grams (g) to ounces (oz), the calculator divides the gram value by 28.349523125. This is equivalent to multiplying by approximately 0.0352739619.",
        "This conversion factor is derived from the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement, which defined the international avoirdupois pound as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound and 1000 grams in a kilogram, the ounce is fixed to this precise value.",
        "This standard is recognized by metrology institutions worldwide, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States, ensuring global consistency for trade and science."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Cooking & Baking: A recipe from Europe calls for 250g of flour. This converts to approximately 8.82 ounces, allowing for accurate ingredient measurements in a US kitchen.",
        "Postage & Shipping: A small package weighing 450g is equivalent to 15.87 ounces. This is crucial for calculating shipping costs, as it falls just under the 1-pound limit for many carriers.",
        "Scientific Research: A lab sample weighing 5g is recorded as 0.176 ounces for documentation shared with international partners who may use the imperial system."

        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert grams to ounces?",
          "answer": "The official formula is: Ounces = Grams / 28.349523125. This is based on the international definition of the avoirdupois ounce."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many grams are in an ounce?",
          "answer": "There are exactly 28.349523125 grams in one international avoirdupois ounce. For most daily uses, this is often rounded to 28.35 grams."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this a fluid ounce or a dry ounce?",
          "answer": "This calculator converts grams (a unit of mass) to avoirdupois ounces (a unit of mass). Fluid ounces are a measure of volume and require a different calculation that depends on the density of the liquid."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is using an exact conversion factor important?",
          "answer": "Using the exact factor is critical for scientific accuracy, scalable recipes, and international trade to prevent cumulative errors and ensure measurements are consistent and reproducible."
