      "introduction": [
        "This ounces to grams converter provides precise results based on the international standard, making it a reliable tool for culinary professionals, scientists, and anyone needing accurate weight conversions.",
        "Every calculation uses the official formula where 1 ounce is defined as exactly 28.349523125 grams, ensuring your conversions are accurate for recipes, shipping weights, and scientific data.",
        "We provide the official formula, worked examples, and authoritative context to help you convert ounces to grams with confidence and avoid common rounding errors found in less precise tools."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "To convert ounces (oz) to grams (g), the calculator multiplies the ounce value by exactly 28.349523125.",
        "This conversion factor is derived from the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement, which defined the international avoirdupois pound as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the ounce-to-gram relationship is fixed to this precise value.",
        "This standard is recognized by metrology institutions worldwide, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States, ensuring global consistency for trade and science."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Cooking & Baking: A recipe calls for 8 oz of cheese. This converts to approximately 226.8 grams, allowing for accurate ingredient measurements when using a metric scale.",
        "Postage & Shipping: A package weighing 12 oz is equivalent to 340.19 grams. This is crucial for international shipping documents that require metric units.",
        "Scientific Research: A lab sample weighing 0.5 oz is recorded as 14.17 grams for documentation shared with international partners who use the metric system."

        {
          "question": "What is the exact formula to convert ounces to grams?",
          "answer": "The official formula is: Grams = Ounces × 28.349523125. This is based on the international definition of the avoirdupois ounce."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many grams are in an ounce?",
          "answer": "There are exactly 28.349523125 grams in one international avoirdupois ounce. For most daily uses, this is often rounded to 28.35 grams."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this a fluid ounce or a dry ounce?",
          "answer": "This calculator converts avoirdupois ounces (a unit of mass) to grams (also a unit of mass). Fluid ounces are a measure of volume and require a different calculation that depends on the density of the liquid."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is using an exact conversion factor important?",
          "answer": "Using the exact factor is critical for scientific accuracy, scalable recipes, and international trade to prevent cumulative errors and ensure measurements are consistent and reproducible."
