    "introduction": [
      "We treat every visit as a chance to own the keyword kilometers per hour to miles per hour by matching MIT OpenCourseWare’s unit rigour and serving a visualization-free answer that still explains the underlying math.",
      "U.S. Department of Transportation guidance on speed measurement keeps the stakes high, so the UI reminds professionals to check their instrumentation and log readings before they trust the result for compliance.",
      "This lean converter surface speeds for transport planners, racers, and safety teams while layering in SEO cues that keep the page near the top of mph-kmh queries."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The engine multiplies by 0.621371192, the NIST-maintained ratio that keeps the conversions reversible and aligned with the SI definitions the agency publishes for international use.",
      "We describe the fluid transition from kilometers per hour to miles per hour through the DOT/NHTSA-prescribed measurement chain (1 mile = 1.609344 km, 1 hour = 3600 seconds) so planners and regulators understand how the number is computed.",
      "Inline messaging surfaces when speeds approach 160 km/h (100 mph) to remind users that instrumentation drift grows with velocity and to encourage confirmation with certified timing equipment."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Entering 120 km/h yields 74.56 mph, giving fleet managers the precise figure they quote on cross-border safety reports.",
      "A cyclist tracking 25 km/h sees 15.53 mph so they can judge their pace against MIT’s biomechanics recommendations without leaving the browser."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does the converter use 0.621371192 instead of a rounded factor?",
        "answer": "We mirror the NIST ratio so conversions stay reversible and the results align with both academic labs and DOT filings; rounding introduces drift when you chain multiple conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this number for regulatory speed limits or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "Yes, but always record the calibration tolerance of your radar, GPS, or flow meter; the calculator provides a quick reference, not a certified instrument reading."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I enter an extraordinarily high speed?",
        "answer": "The output still converts, but the copy surfaces a caution at 160 km/h+ because aerodynamic effects and legal enforcement precision make instrument checks essential."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool safe for comparing track times and highway analytics?",
        "answer": "Absolutely; we build on MIT and DOT conventions so both high-performance teams and public agencies can cite the same figure without guessing the math."
