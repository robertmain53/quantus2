    "introduction": [
      "Every session reinforces our SEO intent by explaining the mph-to-kph ratio with the same clarity found in MIT OpenCourseWare units lessons while keeping the interaction fast for the public.",
      "DOT and FHWA measurement guidance remind us how high-stakes speed conversion can influence compliance, so we add calibration prompts and instrumentation checks alongside the instant result.",
      "This lean experience keeps tables off the page but communicates why the constant matters, layering trust signals for racers, fleet managers, and lab teams alike."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter routes each value through the exact ratio in the SI definitions (1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers) so results remain reversible and consistent with NIST’s published linkage between metric and US customary length units.",
      "We spell out how the hour denominator (3600 seconds) stays intact across the conversion so regulators and engineers understand why multiplying by 1.609344 preserves speed rather than altering time or distance separately.",
      "Inline messaging highlights that instruments drift as velocity increases, encouraging verification on certified GPS, radar, or timing gates when speeds approach enforcement thresholds."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Entering 65 mph returns 104.61 kph, giving highway planners the precise metric target they record in interchange signage studies.",
      "A motoring engineer comparing 15 mph yields 24.14 kph so they can benchmark passenger car experiments without leaving the browser."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do we use 1.609344 and not a rounded value?",
        "answer": "The NIST-defined ratio keeps conversions reversible and avoids drift when you chain mph-to-kph with other units, so rounding would degrade trust for compliance calculators."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this accurate enough for DOT reports or certified timing?",
        "answer": "Yes, as long as you log the calibration tolerance of your radar, GPS, or timing device; the converter delivers the reference number, not the instrument reading itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I enter a really low or really high speed?",
        "answer": "The engine handles the math, but we flag speeds exceeding typical enforcement windows so you pause and verify the instrument’s zero offset or maximum range."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I reuse the output for track analytics or crash reconstruction?",
        "answer": "Absolutely; we align with MIT and DOT conventions so the same number applies whether you are modeling a lap time or documenting a field investigation."
