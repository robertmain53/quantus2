    "introduction": [
      "Enter the pressure in bar and receive a precise PSI answer that matches the exact NIST ratio used by labs, workshops, and field crews.",
      "The converter keeps the interface simple so drivers, mechanics, and safety managers get the number they need to translate European specs into US customary readings.",
      "We surface practical reminders about calibration and instrument checks so the translated value can be trusted for tire pressure, hydraulic, and regulatory tasks."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We start from the SI definition of the bar (exactly 100,000 pascals) and multiply by the NIST-tracked ratio so 1 bar always equals 14.503773773 pounds per square inch, keeping conversions reversible even after chaining multiple computations.",
      "Because OSHA recommends frequent instrument checks, we describe how to compare the PSI output with the original bar reading to validate the gauge's zero offset, and we remind readers that higher pressures demand lower tolerance bands.",
      "The math keeps the 1-hour denominator out of the picture, focusing on length and force components so engineers understand why the constant is a pure ratio rather than a time-dependent value."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Entering 2 bar returns 29.01 psi, giving tire shops the precise figure they note on EU-to-US spec sheets.",
      "Chemical labs logging 0.5 bar see 7.25 psi so they can compare their regulator reading against vacuum standards without rounding mistakes.",
      "A compressed-air team checking 8 bar sees 116.03 psi, highlighting why Jackson Safety guidance suggests verifying manifolds above 100 psi."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does the converter respect the exact NIST ratio?",
        "answer": "Yes, we use 14.503773773 psi per bar so the output matches the ratio in NIST's handbook and remains reversible when converting back."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for regulatory compliance?",
        "answer": "It supplies the reference number, but always pair it with the instrument's calibration certificate when documenting compliance with OSHA, DOT, or local authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I enter negative pressure?",
        "answer": "We prevent negative inputs because bars are gauge pressures here; for vacuum work, consult our pascals-to-kilopascals experience that handles absolute values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do higher pressures need special attention?",
        "answer": "Accuracy slips as PSI climbs because instrumentation drift and fitting leaks become more consequential, so we highlight that certified regulators should be checked against the converted value."
