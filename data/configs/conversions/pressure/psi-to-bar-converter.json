    "introduction": [
      "Type your current PSI value and get the exact bar equivalent based on the NIST ratio so you can translate European specs, lab protocols, or tire pressures in seconds.",
      "The converter stays lean for on-the-go searches while calling out the applications—hydraulics, pneumatics, and regulatory reports—that rely on both PSI and bar readings.",
      "We add practical calibration reminders so the translated number aligns with the instrument's tolerance before you log it for compliance or diagnostics."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The math multiplies PSI by 0.0689475729, the NIST-sanctioned ratio that keeps the conversion reversible and consistent with the SI definition of the bar (exactly 100,000 pascals).",
      "We emphasize the force-over-area derivation taught in MIT OpenCourseWare so you understand the units instead of just memorizing the factor.",
      "OSHA and ISO pressure guidance both recommend confirming regulators and gauges at high pressures, and our copy highlights when to double-check instruments before taking action."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "30 psi converts to 2.07 bar, helping mechanics match US tire stickers to European RPM limits.",
      "120 psi becomes 8.27 bar, giving hydraulic techs the exact metric target when documenting manifolds.",
      "5 psi shows 0.34 bar so lab teams can compare low-pressure experiments without leaving the browser."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion accurate enough for compliance paperwork?",
        "answer": "Yes; we use the NIST ratio so the output matches the same constant auditors expect, but always record the calibration tolerance of your gauge alongside the converted figure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my instrument reads negative PSI?",
        "answer": "Negative PSI readings usually mean vacuum measurements; this converter assumes gauge pressure, so use a dedicated vacuum tool if your system pulls below atmospheric pressure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from bar to PSI?",
        "answer": "Absolutely; divide the bar reading by 0.0689475729 or visit our bar-to-psi converter to reverse the computation instantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I trust this number at very high pressures?",
        "answer": "High pressures amplify instrument drift, so we remind you to validate sensors and regulators per OSHA/ISO guidance before acting on the converted value."
