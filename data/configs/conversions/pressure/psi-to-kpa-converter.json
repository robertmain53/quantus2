        "Safety cues point you back to manufacturer specs and OSHA/ISO guidance whenever pressures approach regulated ranges."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "We multiply PSI by 6.894757293, the NIST-recognized constant derived from the SI pascal definition (1 kPa = 100,000 Pa) and the inch-pound PSI definition.",
        "The factor is linear and reversible: 1 kPa = 0.1450377377 psi. Internal math keeps full precision; rounding is for display.",
        "Gauge vs absolute: the numeric factor is the same, but your reference changes. Note whether your instrument reports gauge or absolute and adjust for atmospheric pressure when needed."

        {
          "question": "Why this factor?",
          "answer": "It is the NIST-backed ratio linking PSI and kPa. Using the exact factor keeps conversions reversible and consistent with engineering handbooks and university fluid mechanics courses."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this suitable for compliance?",
          "answer": "Use it as a reference. Pair the converted number with your gauge’s calibration tolerance and follow OSHA/ISO documentation for regulated equipment."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I handle vacuum readings?",
          "answer": "This tool blocks negative inputs because it assumes gauge pressure. For absolute or vacuum measurements, use a tool designed for absolute pressure and adjust for ambient conditions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I convert back to PSI?",
          "answer": "Yes. Multiply kPa by 0.1450377377 or use the PSI ⇄ kPa swap in the companion converter."
