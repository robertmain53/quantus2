"title": "Convert PSI to kPa with engineering-grade confidence",
"body": [
"This PSI to kPa converter is designed for situations where unit mistakes are not acceptable: gas cylinders, pressure vessels, HVAC systems, autoclaves, and lab or pilot-plant equipment. It uses the same conversion factors published in NIST’s General Tables of Units and the NIST SI guides, so the numbers you record in logbooks, batch records, or calibration sheets stay consistent with national metrology standards.",
"Whether you are an engineer checking a design pressure, a lab technician configuring a sterilization cycle, or a serious home cook following a pressure-based recipe, this tool gives you fast psi ⇄ kPa conversions plus the context you need to use them safely."

"methodology": {
"title": "Methodology and conversion formula (psi → kPa)",
"body": [
"Pressure is defined as force per unit area. In the International System of Units (SI), the coherent unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton per square metre. The kilopascal (kPa) is 1000 Pa and is widely used in engineering, meteorology, and laboratory work.",
"In inch–pound practice, pounds per square inch (psi) represents one pound-force acting on an area of one square inch. It remains common in tire pressure ratings, compressed gas cylinders, and legacy process equipment.",
"This converter follows NIST’s General Tables of Units of Measurement for the relationship between psi and kPa:",
"• 1 psi (lbf/in²) ≈ 6.894757 kPa",
"• 1 kPa ≈ 0.14503774 psi",
"Mathematically:",
"• kPa = psi × 6.894757",
"• psi = kPa × 0.14503774",
"These factors are consistent with NIST Special Publication 330 (The International System of Units), NIST’s Guide to the SI (SP 811), and the pressure unit tables reproduced in NIST technical references used by U.S. federal agencies and industry. University fluid mechanics courses, including MIT OpenCourseWare and other mechanical engineering programs, adopt the same relationships in worked examples and problem sets.",
"Internally, the calculator carries extra precision beyond what is displayed, so you can rely on stable results across repeated conversions and different rounding settings."

"faqs": [
{
"question": "What is the exact formula to convert psi to kPa?",
"answer": "This converter uses the NIST-based factor 1 psi (lbf/in²) ≈ 6.894757 kPa. The conversion formula is kPa = psi × 6.894757. The inverse relationship is psi = kPa × 0.14503774. These values come from NIST’s General Tables of Units of Measurement and are consistent with the SI guidance in NIST Special Publications 330 and 811.",
"anchor": "faq-formula-psi-to-kpa"
},
{
"question": "Is the conversion different for gauge and absolute pressure?",
"answer": "Numerically, the psi-to-kPa conversion is identical for gauge and absolute pressures—the factor between psi and kPa does not change. What changes is the reference point. Gauge pressure is measured relative to the surrounding atmosphere, while absolute pressure is measured relative to a perfect vacuum. If a datasheet says 15 psi(g), that means 15 psi above atmospheric pressure, which is roughly 103 kPa(g). To compare a gauge value with an absolute value, you must add or subtract atmospheric pressure (about 14.7 psi or 101 kPa at sea level).",
"anchor": "faq-gauge-vs-absolute"
},
{
"question": "Can I rely on this converter for safety decisions on cylinders and pressure vessels?",
"answer": "Use this converter for unit consistency, not for final safety decisions. Whether a given pressure is acceptable depends on design codes, materials, temperature, corrosion allowance, and safety factors. Compressed gas cylinders and pressure vessels are regulated under standards and rules such as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.101 and industry codes adopted by EHS offices at universities. Always defer to the stamped nameplate, manufacturer documentation, and applicable standards—the converter simply helps you read those sources in the units you prefer.",
"anchor": "faq-safety"
},
{
"question": "Is this psi to kPa converter suitable for recipes and pressure cookers?",
"answer": "Yes, as a numeric aid. Some high-end cooking references and food safety guidelines express pressure in kPa, while consumer cookbooks and online recipes often use psi. Many pressure cookers and canners have dials or digital controls in kPa or bar. Converting psi to kPa helps you align recipes with your specific device, but you must still follow validated time–temperature–pressure combinations from trusted food safety authorities and the appliance manufacturer.",
"anchor": "faq-recipes"
},
{
"question": "How should I document psi and kPa during calibration?",
"answer": "Good practice is to record both the value and the unit, along with the reference to your calibration standard. Accredited calibration labs and internal QA/QC groups often use NIST-traceable standards and cite NIST SI documents in their procedures. When you enter data into electronic logbooks or maintenance systems, using a consistent psi ⇄ kPa factor avoids rounding drift between different spreadsheets, calculators, or teams.",
"anchor": "faq-calibration"
},
{
"question": "Why not convert psi directly to bar instead of kPa?",
"answer": "Bar is a convenient engineering unit, but the pascal and its multiples (Pa, kPa, MPa) are the SI units recommended by NIST, ISO, and most university engineering programs. Converting psi to kPa keeps your calculations aligned with modern standards and makes it easier to combine pressure data with other SI-based quantities such as stress, energy, and specific volume."
