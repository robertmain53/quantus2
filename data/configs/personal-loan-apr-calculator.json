    "introduction": [
      "This calculator compares standard monthly amortization, equal bi‑weekly amortization (26 payments/year), and the common accelerated bi‑weekly method (splitting the monthly payment in half). Enter the loan amount, the nominal annual interest rate (APR), and the loan term to see payments, total interest, and estimated payoff time.",
      "Results use standard amortization formulas and assume no additional fees, no prepayments other than the calculated schedule, and that payments are applied to principal and interest on the period schedule shown."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Monthly results compute the fixed payment using the standard annuity formula: payment = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n) where r is the periodic rate and n is the number of periods.",
      "Bi‑weekly equal payments use 26 periods per year and the same annuity formula adjusted to the bi‑weekly periodic rate. The accelerated bi‑weekly method splits the monthly payment into two equal payments; because there are 26 bi‑weekly payments per year this typically results in extra principal paid and a shorter term.",
      "Calculations use floating‑point arithmetic consistent with IEEE 754 conventions for numeric operations. Financial rounding is shown in display but intermediate calculations keep higher precision to reduce cumulative rounding error."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate (monthly) = annual_rate_percent / 100 / 12",
      "Monthly payment = principal * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n) with n = term_years * 12",
      "Bi‑weekly periodic rate = annual_rate_percent / 100 / 26; use same annuity formula with n = term_years * 26",
      "Accelerated bi‑weekly uses bi_payment = monthly_payment / 2 and computes the number of bi‑weekly periods required by solving the annuity equation for n"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $10,000 principal, 7% APR, 5 years. Compare monthly payment vs accelerated bi‑weekly: accelerated approach generally reduces total interest and shortens payoff.",
      "Example 2: $25,000 principal, 5.5% APR, 7 years. Equal bi‑weekly schedule with 26 payments/yr yields different periodic payment and an equivalent effective annual rate compounded bi‑weekly."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator show the regulatory APR?",
        "answer": "No. The input 'annual interest rate (nominal APR %)' is treated as the nominal annual rate. Regulatory APR can include certain fees and differing disclosure rules; this tool shows nominal rates, effective periodic rates, payments and totals. For official APR disclosures consult your lender or the consumer finance disclosure you received."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do accelerated bi‑weekly payments pay the loan off faster?",
        "answer": "Splitting the monthly payment into two bi‑weekly payments results in 26 payments per year (equivalent to 13 full monthly payments), which increases annual principal reduction relative to 12 monthly payments and shortens the amortization period."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the numbers?",
        "answer": "Results use standard amortization formulas and double‑precision arithmetic per IEEE 754. Displayed results are rounded for readability. Differences may occur due to lender rounding rules, day count conventions, fees, or payment application timing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I use these outputs when shopping for loans?",
        "answer": "Use the comparison to understand how payment frequency affects total interest and payoff time. Always compare lender disclosures (including any fees) and the legally provided APR. This calculator is for estimation and planning, not a substitute for lender disclosures."
