"introduction": [
"This torque calculator helps you move quickly between the ways torque shows up in real work: at the crankshaft, at the wheel, and in static situations like a torque wrench or a test fixture.",
"Use it to estimate engine torque from horsepower and RPM, compute torque from a known force and lever arm, or translate crank torque through gearbox and final-drive ratios to the tires for performance and traction analysis.",
"Formulas follow standard mechanical engineering references so that tuners, test labs, and design engineers can sanity-check dyno sheets, datasheets, and hand calculations with a single tool."
],
"methodology": [
"Torque is defined in mechanics as the cross product of position vector and force vector and, in the simple perpendicular case, reduces to torque = force × lever arm distance. In SI units this gives newton-metres (N·m), with force in newtons and distance in metres, as found in university-level statics and dynamics courses.",
"For the static torque method, this calculator applies the basic relationship torque (N·m) = force (N) × distance (m). This matches the treatment of moments in standard engineering mechanics texts and lecture notes used in undergraduate mechanical engineering curricula.",
"For the engine torque from horsepower method, the calculator uses the widely accepted relationship torque (lb·ft) = 5252 × horsepower / RPM. The constant 5252 comes from equating power in horsepower to torque and rotational speed in radians per second, using the definitions 1 horsepower = 33,000 lb·ft per minute and 2π radians per revolution.",
"Once torque is computed in pound-feet, it is converted to newton-metres using the factor 1 lb·ft ≈ 1.3558179483 N·m, consistent with SI conversion values published by national metrology institutes. This provides parallel SI and imperial values for users working with mixed-unit data.",
"For wheel torque, the calculator multiplies the input engine torque by the gearbox ratio and the final drive ratio to obtain the theoretical torque at the driven axle. It then scales this by a user-specified driveline efficiency factor between 0 and 1 to account for typical losses in the gearbox, differential, and bearings.",
"These methods are intended for quick estimation, checking dyno plots, comparing setups, and sizing components. For safety-critical design, you should combine these results with manufacturer data, measured torque curves, and factors of safety recommended in professional design standards."
],
"examples": [
"A road car produces 300 horsepower at 6000 RPM on a chassis dynamometer. Using the engine torque method, torque ≈ 5252 × 300 / 6000 ≈ 262 lb·ft, which corresponds to roughly 355 N·m.",
"A technician applies a 200 N force on a 0.30 m torque wrench. The static torque method gives torque = 200 × 0.30 = 60 N·m, or about 44.3 lb·ft, which can be compared to the tightening specification in a service manual.",
"A performance build delivers 400 N·m at the crankshaft. With a 3.50:1 gearbox ratio, 3.90:1 final drive, and an estimated driveline efficiency of 0.90, the wheel torque is approximately 400 × 3.50 × 3.90 × 0.90 ≈ 4914 N·m, or about 3627 lb·ft at the tire."
],
"summary": [
"Use this calculator to translate between force, distance, engine power, gearing, and torque in a way that mirrors the formulas taught in mechanical engineering courses and used in professional automotive practice.",
"Because the methods rely on standard definitions of torque, horsepower, and unit conversion, the outputs can be used to sanity-check dyno runs, spec sheets, and hand calculations before you commit to design or tuning decisions."

"glossary": [
{
"term": "Torque",
"definition": "A measure of the tendency of a force to cause rotation about an axis, typically expressed in newton-metres (N·m) or pound-feet (lb·ft)."
},
{
"term": "Horsepower",
"definition": "A unit of power commonly used for engine output, defined in the imperial system as 550 lb·ft per second or 33,000 lb·ft per minute."
},
{
"term": "Lever arm",
"definition": "The perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the applied force."
},
{
"term": "Gear ratio",
"definition": "The ratio of output speed to input speed, or equivalently input torque to output torque, for a gear pair or gearbox stage."
},
{
"term": "Final drive ratio",
"definition": "The torque-multiplying ratio between the driveshaft and the driven wheels, typically implemented in the differential of a vehicle."

"definition": "The fraction of engine torque that reaches the wheels after accounting for friction and mechanical losses in the transmission, differential, and other rotating components."
}
],
"faqs": [
{
"question": "What is the difference between torque and horsepower?",
"answer": "Torque measures the twisting force available at a shaft, while horsepower measures the rate at which work is done. At a given engine speed, horsepower is proportional to torque times RPM. In practical terms, torque is closely related to how strongly an engine can accelerate a load, while horsepower relates to how much work it can do over time and how fast a vehicle can ultimately go."
},
{
"question": "How accurate are the torque results from this calculator?",
"answer": "For static torque and simple lever-arm problems, the results are as accurate as your inputs for force and distance and the underlying unit conversions. For engine torque, the formula using horsepower and RPM is standard in automotive engineering, but the accuracy depends on the quality of the dyno or test data you supply and any corrections for drivetrain losses."
},
{
"question": "Why does the engine torque calculation use the constant 5252?",
"answer": "The constant 5252 comes from relating horsepower, torque in pound-feet, and rotational speed in revolutions per minute. Using the definitions of horsepower and converting between radians per second and revolutions per minute yields the approximate factor 5252, which is widely used in engine performance analysis."
},
{
"question": "Can I use this tool for both SI and imperial units?",
"answer": "Yes. The calculator accepts inputs in commonly used quantities such as horsepower, RPM, force in newtons, and distance in metres, and it outputs torque in both newton-metres and pound-feet using standard SI conversion factors. This makes it suitable for international work and mixed-unit datasets."
},
{
"question": "How should I choose a realistic driveline efficiency value?",
"answer": "Typical driveline efficiencies for modern passenger vehicles are in the range of about 0.85 to 0.95, depending on the transmission type, lubricant condition, and drivetrain layout. Laboratory measurements and manufacturer data can refine this, but using values in this range generally provides useful wheel-torque estimates for comparison and sizing."
},
{
"question": "Is this calculator sufficient for safety-critical design decisions?",
"answer": "No. While the formulas and conversions follow trusted engineering references, safety-critical components such as shafts, gears, and fasteners must be designed using detailed load spectra, material properties, fatigue analysis, and factors of safety defined in relevant design standards. Use this calculator for estimates and checks, then consult formal design codes and test data."
},
{
"question": "Can I use this tool to validate dynamometer results?",
"answer": "Yes. If you have horsepower versus RPM data from an engine or chassis dynamometer, you can cross-check the torque values reported by the dyno using the relationship torque = 5252 × horsepower / RPM. Large discrepancies may indicate configuration issues, unit mismatches, or measurement errors that should be investigated."
