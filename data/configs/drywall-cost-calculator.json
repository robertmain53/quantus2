    "introduction": [
      "This calculator provides a practical installed-cost estimate for drywall (gypsum board) projects by converting a measured surface area into the number of sheets required and combining material plus labor allowances. It is intended for quick budgeting and planning; use contractor proposals for final pricing.",
      "Estimates account for sheet size, cutting/waste allowance, a per-sheet material price, and a labor rate adjusted by a finishing-level multiplier to reflect taping, joint compound, and sanding effort."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Sheet area is computed by converting sheet width in inches to feet (width_in / 12) and multiplying by sheet height in feet. The number of sheets equals total surface area divided by single-sheet area, increased by the waste percentage and rounded up to whole sheets.",
      "Material cost equals sheets required times the per-sheet price. Labor cost is calculated from total surface area multiplied by the labour rate and adjusted by the finishing multiplier. Total cost is material plus labor. These steps follow standard estimating practice used in residential and light-commercial construction and align with unit conventions from NIST.",
      "For handling, worker safety, and site controls consult OSHA construction guidance and local building codes; disposal, permits, and specialty finishes (moisture- or fire-rated boards) add separate costs."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Single sheet area (sq ft) = (sheet_width_in / 12) * sheet_height_ft",
      "Sheets required = ceil(total_area_sqft / single_sheet_area * (1 + waste_percent / 100))",
      "Material cost = sheets_required * material_cost_per_sheet",
      "Labor cost = total_area_sqft * labor_cost_per_sqft * finish_multiplier",
      "Total installed cost = material cost + labor cost",
      "Installed cost per sq ft = total installed cost / total_area_sqft"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 500 sq ft, 48 in × 8 ft sheets, 10% waste, $12/sheet, $2.50/sq ft labor, 1.2 finish: yields sheets, material, labor and total cost.",
      "Example 2: For ceilings or high walls, increase waste_percent to account for extra cuts and scaffold time; adjust finish_multiplier for additional corner work or heavy texture."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Can I enter multiple rooms or different sheet sizes?",
        "answer": "This calculator uses a single total surface area. For multiple rooms or mixed sheet sizes, sum the surface areas into one total or run separate calculations per room and add results for the most accurate count."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose the waste percentage?",
        "answer": "Typical waste ranges from 5% for large, regular rooms up to 15% or more for small irregular rooms, many openings, or ceilings. Use a higher waste for small rooms, nonstandard heights, or where many cuts are required."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the finish-level multiplier represent?",
        "answer": "Finish multiplier scales labor to account for taping, joint compound coats, sanding, and texture. Use 1.0 for minimal finishing, 1.1–1.3 for standard finish, and higher values for premium or complex finishes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the estimate include fasteners, joint tape, corner bead, or paint?",
        "answer": "No. This tool estimates board count, board material cost, and labor for hanging/finishing. Add separate line items for fasteners, tape, beads, corner guards, primer/paint, scaffolding, waste disposal, and permits."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the result?",
        "answer": "Estimates are intended for planning and budgeting. Accuracy depends on the precision of your inputs (area, local rates, waste allowance). Typical variation versus a detailed contractor bid can be ±10–20% depending on site complexity and local labor markets."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety considerations I should know?",
        "answer": "Yes. Follow OSHA construction safety requirements for manual handling and fall protection. Use appropriate rated board types (fire, moisture, mold) where required by local building codes. Engage licensed contractors when structural changes or code compliance is at issue."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I account for ceilings or high walls?",
        "answer": "Increase waste_percent and consider higher labor_cost_per_sqft to reflect additional time for lifts, scaffolding, or taping overhead. For very high walls, consult a contractor for an accurate bid."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator include removal or disposal of existing drywall?",
        "answer": "No. Demolition, hauling, and disposal are not included and should be estimated separately based on volume, local landfill fees, and any hazardous-material handling requirements."
