    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a data transfer rate expressed in megabits per second (Mbps) to megabytes per second (MB/s). It is intended for quick unit conversions used in networking, bandwidth planning, and file transfer time estimates.",
      "Bits and bytes are different units: 1 byte = 8 bits. Many networking speeds are quoted in bits per second while file sizes are commonly expressed in bytes, so converting between Mbps and MB/s is a frequent practical need. This converter assumes the conventional definitions described below but highlights decimal versus binary distinctions and protocol overhead that affect real-world throughput."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the fixed mathematical relationship between bits and bytes: 8 bits = 1 byte. The primary conversion is therefore exact: MB/s = Mbps ÷ 8, when both units use decimal prefixes.",
      "Standards and nomenclature: this page follows international guidance on unit presentation and prefixes. When greater precision is required, consider whether the measurement uses decimal SI prefixes (mega = 10^6) or binary prefixes (mebi = 2^20). Also account for network and protocol overhead; the theoretical conversion does not include packet headers, retransmissions, or application-layer framing.",
      "Accuracy caveats: reported link rates (e.g., an ISP's advertised Mbps) are link-layer or PHY rates and do not guarantee sustained application-layer MB/s. For regulatory and presentation guidance, consult national metrology and standards organizations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base relationship: 1 byte = 8 bits.",
      "Decimal megabit/megabyte conversion (common): MB/s = Mbps ÷ 8. Example: 100 Mbps = 100 ÷ 8 = 12.5 MB/s.",
      "If source uses binary megabytes (mebibyte): MiB/s = (Mbps ÷ 8) × (10^6 ÷ 2^20) ≈ (Mbps ÷ 8) × 0.953674. Adjust if your source explicitly uses MiB.",
      "Remember: multiply or divide only after confirming whether units are decimal (MB = 10^6 bytes) or binary (MiB = 2^20 bytes)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "50 Mbps → 50 ÷ 8 = 6.25 MB/s (decimal MB)",
      "1000 Mbps → 1000 ÷ 8 = 125 MB/s (decimal MB)",
      "10 Mbps → 10 ÷ 8 = 1.25 MB/s (decimal MB)",
      "100 Mbps using MiB: 100 ÷ 8 = 12.5 decimal MB/s; in MiB/s ≈ 12.5 × 0.953674 = 11.921 MiB/s"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is MB/s the same as MBps or MBps vs Mbps?",
        "answer": "MB/s and MBps are commonly used to mean megabytes per second (bytes per second). Mbps (lowercase b) means megabits per second (bits per second). The key difference is a factor of 8: 1 byte = 8 bits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my 100 Mbps connection not give 12.5 MB/s file downloads?",
        "answer": "Real-world transfers are affected by protocol overhead, encryption, server or disk limits, congestion, and measurement methodology. Advertised link speed is a peak physical-layer rate; application-layer throughput is usually lower."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use MB (decimal) or MiB (binary) in calculations?",
        "answer": "Use decimal MB (10^6 bytes) when the source explicitly states MB or when using most networking or storage vendor specifications. Use MiB (2^20 bytes) only when a tool or dataset explicitly uses binary prefixes. Always confirm the unit definition in your data source."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter include overheads like TCP/IP headers?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a pure unit conversion between bits and bytes. It does not account for protocol headers, encapsulation, retransmissions, or other real-world overheads. For throughput planning, include an overhead margin appropriate to your protocol and environment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert MB/s back to Mbps?",
        "answer": "Multiply by 8. Mbps = MB/s × 8 (assuming both use the same prefix definition: decimal or binary)."
