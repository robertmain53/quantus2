    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a data rate expressed in megabits per second (Mbps, lowercase 'b' = bits) into megabytes per second (MB/s, uppercase 'B' = bytes). It is designed for network throughput and file-transfer contexts where users need a clear numeric translation between bits and bytes.",
      "Network speeds are commonly advertised in decimal megabits (1 megabit = 1 000 000 bits). Converting to megabytes typically uses the decimal megabyte (1 megabyte = 1 000 000 bytes) unless you specifically need the binary mebibyte (MiB = 1 048 576 bytes). This tool uses the conventional network / SI interpretation by default and explains the binary alternative.",
      "Use this converter for quick estimates, bandwidth planning, and user-facing displays. For protocol-level measurements or billing-grade metrology, account for measurement resolution, sampling interval, and protocol overhead as described in the methodology and FAQs."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Fundamental relationship: 1 byte = 8 bits. Therefore byte-based rates equal bit-based rates divided by 8 when both use the same prefix definition (decimal or binary).",
      "Decimal (SI) prefixes: network throughput is typically measured using decimal prefixes where 1 megabit = 10^6 bits and 1 megabyte = 10^6 bytes. Under that convention MB/s = Mbps / 8.",
      "Binary prefixes (mebibyte) are sometimes used for storage and memory. If you need MiB/s (mebibytes per second) instead of MB/s, convert bits to bytes then divide by 2^20 bytes per mebibyte. Also note real-world transfers include protocol overhead (TCP/IP headers, encryption, packetization) that reduces application-layer throughput compared with line-rate."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal megabyte result (recommended for network speeds): MB/s = Mbps ÷ 8. Example: 100 Mbps → 100 ÷ 8 = 12.5 MB/s.",
      "Binary mebibyte result (if you need MiB/s): MiB/s = (Mbps × 1 000 000) ÷ (8 × 1 048 576) = Mbps × 0.11920928955078125. Example: 100 Mbps → ≈ 11.920928955078125 MiB/s.",
      "Step-by-step: 1) Convert megabits per second to bits per second: bits/s = Mbps × 1 000 000. 2) Convert bits to bytes: bytes/s = bits/s ÷ 8. 3) If using MB (decimal), divide bytes/s by 1 000 000; if using MiB (binary), divide bytes/s by 1 048 576."

    "examples": [
      "100 Mbps → 12.5 MB/s (decimal MB)",
      "50 Mbps → 6.25 MB/s (decimal MB)",
      "100 Mbps → 11.920928955078125 MiB/s (binary MiB)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why is there a difference between Mbps and MB/s?",
        "answer": "Mbps measures bits per second (lowercase 'b'), while MB/s measures bytes per second (uppercase 'B'). Because 1 byte = 8 bits, byte-based rates are the bit-based value divided by 8, all else equal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which conversion should I use: MB (decimal) or MiB (binary)?",
        "answer": "For network throughput and internet service advertising, use decimal megabytes (MB, 10^6 bytes). For storage and memory contexts, binary mebibytes (MiB, 2^20 bytes) are common. The converter shows the standard decimal conversion; the methodology explains the binary alternative."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does a speed test show a different MB/s than this conversion?",
        "answer": "Speed tests measure real application-layer throughput and include protocol overhead, packet loss, congestion, TCP windowing, and measurement sampling windows. Advertised line-rate is physical bits per second; application-layer bytes per second are typically lower due to headers, retransmits, and encryption."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is this conversion and are there rounding recommendations?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact given the chosen prefix definitions (decimal or binary). For display, rounding to two or three decimal places is common for MB/s. For engineering or billing use, keep full precision until final aggregation and follow your metrology standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert other rate units, like KB/s, GiB/day, or bytes per second?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the same steps: convert bits to bytes (divide by 8), then apply the desired prefix (decimal or binary). For larger intervals (per day), multiply the per-second value by 86 400 seconds. Be explicit about using decimal (kB, MB, GB) vs binary (KiB, MiB, GiB) prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there standards or references I can cite for these conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use internationally recognized standards for prefix definitions (SI) and recommendations on binary prefixes. Government and standards bodies provide guidance; see the citations for authoritative references."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does packetization or encryption affect the measured MB/s?",
        "answer": "Yes. Packet headers, tunneling, and encryption add overhead that consumes bits on the wire but do not contribute to application payload bytes; therefore measured MB/s for payload will be less than raw line-rate divided by 8."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I consider when converting for capacity planning?",
        "answer": "Include average protocol overhead, diurnal traffic patterns, TCP efficiency, desired headroom, and measurement uncertainty. For contractual or safety-critical scenarios, follow applicable measurement and calibration standards and document the chosen prefix convention."
