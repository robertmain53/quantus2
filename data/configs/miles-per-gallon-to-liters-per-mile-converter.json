    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts fuel economy given in miles per gallon (MPG) into liters consumed per mile (L/mi). The relationship is based on the exact volumetric definition of the gallon in liters and the definition of MPG as miles traveled per one gallon of fuel.",
      "For everyday accuracy we use the internationally accepted liter value for each gallon type (US and Imperial) and show the primary formula that professionals use when comparing fuel use across unit systems. This page provides practical guidance on which gallon definition applies, how the conversion is calculated, and typical rounding and measurement cautions.",
      "For regulatory and engineering contexts, always specify which gallon is used (US or Imperial) and report the conversion precision. References below include U.S. government energy resources and national measurement authorities."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Fuel economy in MPG is miles per gallon. To get liters per mile, invert the MPG definition by expressing one gallon in liters and dividing by the MPG value.",
      "We use the US liquid gallon value 1 US gal = 3.785411784 L for conversions unless an Imperial (UK) gallon is explicitly selected; the Imperial gallon equals 4.54609 L. The converter applies the appropriate constant and returns L/mi.",
      "When comparing to widely published metrics (e.g., L/100 km), convert L/mi to L/100 km by multiplying L/mi by 160.9344 (100 km = 62.137119 miles). For regulatory reporting use the units and rounding required by the relevant agency."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula (US gallon): L per mile = 3.785411784 ÷ (MPG).",
      "Imperial gallon option: L per mile = 4.54609 ÷ (MPG_imperial).",
      "To convert result to liters per 100 kilometers: L/100 km = L/mi × 160.9344."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 (US gallon): 30 MPG → L/mi = 3.785411784 ÷ 30 = 0.12618 L/mi.",
      "Example 2 (Imperial gallon): 30 MPG (imperial) → L/mi = 4.54609 ÷ 30 = 0.15154 L/mi.",
      "Example 3: To express 0.12618 L/mi as L/100 km: 0.12618 × 160.9344 = 20.31 L/100 km."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which gallon does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "By default the converter uses the US liquid gallon (1 US gal = 3.785411784 L). An Imperial (UK) gallon option and a note explaining the difference are provided; always confirm which gallon your MPG figure uses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why express fuel economy as liters per mile instead of MPG?",
        "answer": "Liters per mile (or liters per 100 km) is a direct measure of fuel consumed per distance and is linear with fuel use—useful in engineering, fleet reporting, and emissions calculations where per-distance consumption is additive across trips. MPG is non-linear when averaged, so converting to L/mi avoids averaging bias in some analyses."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "For consumer-facing displays, two to three significant digits are usually sufficient (e.g., 0.126 L/mi). For regulatory or engineering work, follow the precision rules in the applicable guidance (for example, DOE/EPA and national metrology guidance) and include measurement uncertainty where required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does vehicle instrument error affect conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. Instrument-derived MPG (onboard computers, trip odometers, fuel-pump totals) include measurement error. When precision matters, estimate and report uncertainty from the measurement method; see national metrology guidance for uncertainty propagation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert MPG (US) to liters per 100 kilometers?",
        "answer": "First convert MPG to L/mi using L/mi = 3.785411784 ÷ MPG, then multiply L/mi by 160.9344 to get L/100 km."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the constants authoritative?",
        "answer": "Yes. The liter values used for US and Imperial gallons are the internationally recognized volumetric definitions published by national measurement authorities and referenced by US government energy resources."
