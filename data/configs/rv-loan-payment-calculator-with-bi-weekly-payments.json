    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates payment amounts for RV loans when you elect bi‑weekly payments (26 payments per year) or any other payment frequency you enter. Enter the vehicle price, down payment, APR, loan term in years, and payments per year; the tool returns the periodic payment, equivalent monthly amount, total payments, total paid, and estimated total interest.",
      "Results assume a level amortizing loan with the provided nominal APR converted to a periodic rate by dividing APR by the number of payments per year. This is a standard mathematical amortization model intended for planning and comparison, not a binding offer."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We convert the stated APR (%) to a periodic interest rate by dividing by the payments per year you specify. For bi‑weekly payments, use 26.",
      "Periodic payment is calculated using the standard annuity amortization formula for level payments: payment = r * PV / (1 - (1 + r)^-N) where r is the periodic rate and N is the total number of payments.",
      "Total paid and total interest are derived from the calculated periodic payment multiplied by N, minus principal financed (price minus down payment)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate r = APR / 100 / payments_per_year",
      "Total periods N = term_years * payments_per_year",
      "Periodic payment = ((principal - down_payment) * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-N)",
      "Total paid = periodic payment * N",
      "Total interest = Total paid - (principal - down_payment)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $50,000 RV, $5,000 down, 6.5% APR, 10 years, bi‑weekly (26). Principal financed = $45,000. Periodic rate = 6.5 / 100 / 26. N = 10 * 26 = 260. Payment = formula above; the calculator shows bi‑weekly payment and equivalent monthly amount for budgeting.",
      "Switching from monthly (12) to bi‑weekly (26) typically reduces interest marginally and changes cash flow timing. Verify lender application of extra payments: some lenders apply bi‑weekly as half‑monthly and simply split monthly payments rather than true extra‑payment schedules."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does the calculator divide APR by payments per year?",
        "answer": "APR is an annual nominal rate. For level periodic payments the nominal APR is converted to a periodic rate by dividing by the number of payment periods per year to compute each period's interest component."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does using bi‑weekly payments always save interest?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly schedules can reduce interest only if the lender truly applies each payment when received and amortizes accordingly. If a lender converts bi‑weekly to an equivalent monthly schedule without applying extra principal early, interest savings may be negligible. Confirm with your lender how they process bi‑weekly payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this a guaranteed quote or an offer?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator provides estimates for planning purposes. Actual lender offers may differ because of fees, rounding, payment processing rules, compounding conventions, and credit-based pricing. Always request a written disclosure from your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might results differ from a lender's calculator?",
        "answer": "Differences arise from rounding rules, day‑count conventions, whether the lender uses nominal APR vs effective rate, fees added to principal, or how extra/early payments are handled. Use this tool for consistent comparisons and then confirm specifics with the lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are fees or taxes included?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator does not automatically include origination fees, documentation fees, taxes, or insurance. Add those to the financed amount or adjust the principal to model their effect."
