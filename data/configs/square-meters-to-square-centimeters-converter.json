    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts area values between square meters (m²) and square centimeters (cm²) using the exact SI relationship. It is intended for engineering, laboratory, construction, and everyday use where a fixed mathematical conversion is required.",
      "Area conversions follow from linear unit conversion: because 1 metre = 100 centimetres, the area conversion scales by the square of the linear factor. The conversion is exact in the mathematical sense: 1 m² = 10,000 cm².",
      "Use this tool for unit translation, quick checks, and documentation. For physical measurements, pair numeric conversion with instrument calibration and uncertainty estimates described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is derived from SI-consistent definitions of the metre and centimetre. The linear relation 1 m = 100 cm is squared to convert area units: (1 m)² = (100 cm)² = 10,000 cm².",
      "This converter applies that fixed mathematical factor deterministically; it does not estimate measurement uncertainty. When converting measured quantities, combine this numeric conversion with the measurement’s calibration and uncertainty (for example, per NIST and ISO guidance).",
      "Recommended practice: retain significant figures consistent with the original measurement’s uncertainty. For recorded values used in specifications or reports, document the number of significant digits and any rounding applied."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Linear relationship: 1 metre = 100 centimetres.",
      "Step 2 — Square the linear factor for area: (1 m)² = (100 cm)² = 100 × 100 = 10,000.",
      "Compact formula: value_in_cm² = value_in_m² × 10000. Conversely: value_in_m² = value_in_cm² ÷ 10000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.5 m² → 0.5 × 10,000 = 5,000 cm²",
      "2 m² → 2 × 10,000 = 20,000 cm²",
      "0.0003 m² → 0.0003 × 10,000 = 3 cm²"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between m² and cm²?",
        "answer": "Exact relationship: 1 m² = 10,000 cm² because 1 m = 100 cm and area scales with the square of the linear factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle significant figures when converting?",
        "answer": "Keep the same number of significant figures that are supported by the original measurement. Convert using the exact factor, then round the result to reflect measurement uncertainty or reporting needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a deterministic unit conversion. For measurements, separately apply instrument calibration data and uncertainty budgets following guidance from standards bodies such as NIST and ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert very large or very small areas without losing precision?",
        "answer": "Perform the conversion using the exact factor (×10000 or ÷10000) in software or a scientific calculator that preserves sufficient precision. When presenting results, format with engineering notation or appropriate significant figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regional differences in the unit names or symbols I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "The SI symbols m² and cm² are international and standardized. Use the SI symbols in technical documentation. Local conventions might spell out 'square metre' or 'square meter' in text, but the numeric relationship is universal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find official guidance on units and reporting?",
        "answer": "Refer to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) for authoritative guidance on SI units and best practices for measurement and reporting."
