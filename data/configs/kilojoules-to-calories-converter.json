    "introduction": [
      "Convert energy values from kilojoules (kJ) to dietary Calories (kilocalories, kcal) using SI-consistent unit definitions. This tool applies the standard thermochemical relations used in metrology and nutrition science.",
      "For clarity: in nutrition contexts a Capital 'Calorie' (Cal) = 1 kilocalorie (kcal). The converter returns kilocalories unless you specifically need small calories (cal)."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the thermochemical definition that 1 calorie (small cal) = 4.184 joules (J). By extension, 1 kilocalorie (1 kcal or 1 Cal) = 4,184 J and 1 kilojoule = 1,000 J. We apply these fixed SI relationships without empirical estimation.",
      "This converter uses the precise factor consistent with NIST metrology: 1 kJ = 1000 J, and 1 kcal = 4184 J, so kcal = kJ / 4.184. Results are presented with sensible rounding for readability and scientific traceability."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base definitions: 1 calorie (small cal) = 4.184 J; 1 kilocalorie (kcal) = 4184 J; 1 kilojoule (kJ) = 1000 J.",
      "Direct conversion formulas you can use: kcal = kJ / 4.184, or equivalently kcal = kJ × 0.239005736.",
      "If you need small calories (cal), use: cal = kJ × 239.005736. For nutrition labels and diet planning, use kilocalories (kcal)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 kJ → 23.9005736 kcal (≈ 23.90 kcal)",
      "4184 kJ → 1000 kcal (by definition: 4184 ÷ 4.184 = 1000)",
      "1 kJ → 0.239005736 kcal (≈ 0.2390 kcal)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Are you converting to small calories (cal) or dietary Calories (kcal)?",
        "answer": "This converter returns dietary Calories (kcal). In nutrition contexts 'Calorie' (capital C) equals 1 kilocalorie (kcal). If you require small calories (cal), multiply kcal by 1000 or use the small-calorie conversion provided above."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the exact numeric factor used?",
        "answer": "We use the thermochemical definition: 1 kcal = 4184 J and 1 kJ = 1000 J, so 1 kJ = 0.239005736 kcal (kcal = kJ / 4.184). This follows NIST conventions for unit definitions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for nutrition labels or recipes?",
        "answer": "For diet and food labels, follow the regulatory rounding rules of your jurisdiction (for example, FDA and other national agencies provide guidance). For informal use, two decimal places for kcal is usually sufficient; for scientific reporting, keep more significant figures and state uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the tool account for measurement uncertainty from calorimetry?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs exact unit conversion using fixed constants. Measurement uncertainty from experimental calorimetry (instrument calibration, heat losses, sample variability) must be handled upstream and reported separately according to metrology best practices (for example, NIST guidelines)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for regulatory nutrition labeling?",
        "answer": "Use this converter for accurate unit conversion only. For regulatory nutrition labeling, follow your local authority's methodology for energy calculation and rounding (for example, FDA in the United States or comparable national agencies). Cross-check with official nutrition databases when calculating food energy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some sources quote 4.186 J per calorie instead of 4.184 J?",
        "answer": "Different definitions (thermochemical vs. International Table) historically produced slightly different values. The internationally adopted thermochemical value used by modern metrology and nutrition references is 4.184 J per small calorie. Use NIST and official standards for authoritative values."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from kcal to kJ?",
        "answer": "Reverse the formula: kJ = kcal × 4.184. This is the exact SI-consistent relationship used in scientific and regulatory contexts."
