      "Convert a net price to VAT and gross in one step so invoices, receipts, and quotes stay consistent with your jurisdiction’s rates.",
      "Editable VAT rate covers standard and reduced bands across the EU and UK, while keeping the calculator lean for quick checks.",
      "Both VAT amount and gross price appear together to align finance, procurement, and compliance teams."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "VAT = net price × (rate/100); gross = net + VAT. This mirrors EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC and HMRC guidance for forward calculations.",
      "Inputs are unit-agnostic (currency) and we apply no hidden rounding; round per your invoicing rules.",

      {
        "question": "How should I round the results?",
        "answer": "Round per your jurisdiction’s invoicing rules (e.g., to the nearest cent/penny). The calculator keeps full precision until display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I handle exempt or zero-rated items?",
        "answer": "Yes. Set the rate to 0% to show VAT 0 and gross = net."

      {
        "question": "Is this acceptable for audits?",
        "answer": "Yes—record the rate, jurisdiction, and rounding. Cite HMRC VAT Notice 700 or your local EU guidance when filing."
