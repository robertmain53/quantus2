    "introduction": [
      "This calculator compares three approaches: standard monthly amortization, true bi‑weekly amortization (26 payments per year calculated to amortize over the same term), and an accelerated bi‑weekly approach produced by splitting the monthly payment into two payments each month period (typically results in extra annual payments and earlier payoff).",
      "Enter your loan amount, APR, and original term. Results show per‑period payments, estimated payoff time for the accelerated option, total interest under each method, and approximate interest saved when switching to accelerated bi‑weekly payments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "All calculations use the standard amortization formula for fixed‑rate loans: periodic rate = APR/periods_per_year; payment = P * i / (1 - (1+i)^-N). For the accelerated comparison, the monthly amortizing payment is halved and treated as a bi‑weekly payment; the number of bi‑weekly periods until payoff is estimated by solving the amortization equation for N.",
      "Assumptions and limits: this tool assumes fixed interest rate and no fees, no deferred interest, and interest accrues between payments according to the periodic rate. It does not model lender policies such as application of extra payments, minimum payment amounts, late fees, or payment allocation rules."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Monthly payment: payment = P * (r/12) / (1 - (1 + r/12)^(-term_years*12)), where r = APR/100.",
      "Bi‑weekly amortized payment: payment = P * (r/26) / (1 - (1 + r/26)^(-term_years*26)).",
      "Accelerated bi‑weekly (splitting monthly payment): bi_payment = monthly_payment / 2. Solve for N using N = -ln(1 - P*(r/26)/bi_payment) / ln(1 + r/26). Total interest = bi_payment * N - P."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Will switching to bi‑weekly always save me money?",
        "answer": "Splitting your monthly payment into bi‑weekly payments typically results in more payments per year (26 vs 24 half‑payments) and can reduce interest and shorten the term. True bi‑weekly amortization (recalculating payment frequency but keeping the same term) may not produce the same savings. Savings depend on how payments are applied and your lender's policies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include fees, capitalization, or insurance?",
        "answer": "No. This tool models principal and interest only. It does not include origination fees, late fees, insurance, capitalization of deferred interest, or other charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these estimates?",
        "answer": "Results are estimates based on closed‑form amortization formulas and assume timely application of payments and a fixed interest rate. Real‑world results vary by lender handling of extra payments, rounding, and statement cycles. See the accuracy and standards notes below."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the computed accelerated payment is less than interest due for a period?",
        "answer": "If the payment used is less than the per‑period interest (principal * periodic rate), the loan will not amortize and the formulas will be invalid. The calculator will produce non‑finite results in that case; increase payment or reduce term."
