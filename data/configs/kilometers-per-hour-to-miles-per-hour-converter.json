    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a speed value expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h) to its equivalent in miles per hour (mph). The conversion uses the internationally accepted relationship between the kilometre and the mile.",
      "The numeric conversion is exact given the defined length of the mile in meters (1 mile = 1609.344 m) and the kilometre in meters (1 km = 1000 m). Results can be displayed with user-selected rounding in the UI, but this page provides the full-precision factor and practical rounding guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies a fixed, single-step multiplication based on SI unit definitions: mph = km/h × (1000 meters per kilometre ÷ 1609.344 meters per mile). The relationship is derived from the international definitions of the metre, kilometre, and mile.",
      "For measurement and reporting, follow national and international guidance on units and instrumentation calibration. Relevant references include NIST guidance on SI units, ISO standards on quantities and units, and standards for measurement and calibration practices."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: mph = km/h × 1000 / 1609.344",
      "Commonly used numeric factor: mph = km/h × 0.62137119223733",
      "Rounded display guidance: for everyday use round to 1 decimal place (e.g., 90.0 km/h → 55.9 mph). For engineering or compliance use, follow instrument uncertainty and report to the precision justified by calibration data."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100 km/h → 100 × 0.62137119223733 = 62.137119223733 mph (commonly shown as 62.1 mph when rounded to one decimal).",
      "Example 2: 50 km/h → 50 × 0.62137119223733 = 31.0685596118665 mph (commonly shown as 31.1 mph when rounded to one decimal)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. Given the defined meter, kilometre and international yard/mile relationships, the factor 1000/1609.344 is exact based on those definitions. Practical outputs are rounded for display but the mathematical relationship is exact."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust?",
        "answer": "Trust decimal places only up to the combined uncertainty of the source measurement and the display rounding. For consumer contexts, one decimal place is appropriate. For instrumentation and compliance, report values consistent with calibration certificates and the instrument's documented uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for speedometer or legal tolerances?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a pure unit conversion. Legal tolerances for speedometers, vehicle equipment, or workplace safety are set by jurisdiction-specific regulations and are not applied here. Consult relevant regulatory guidance and device calibration records for compliance figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might displayed conversions differ between tools?",
        "answer": "Differences typically arise from display rounding, the number of digits shown, or whether a tool applies additional post-processing (for example rounding toward even, truncation, or applying a jurisdictional correction). The underlying mathematical factor should be the same."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or occupational standards to consider when converting speeds?",
        "answer": "While unit conversion is purely mathematical, applying converted values in safety calculations, signage, or engineering must respect applicable standards for measurement accuracy, calibration, and reporting. See the cited standards for guidance on measurement practices and documentation."
