1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion requires a variable exchange rate and optional adjustments (fees, markup, or rounding), so the computation needs multiple inputs (amount, exchange rate source or custom rate, fees/markup) to produce one primary output.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), and no HTML tags.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata, no schema_org, no arbitrary UI/layout keys, and I will include only fields allowed for simple_calc per the schema).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
