    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a temperature given in kelvins (K) to degrees Rankine (°R). Kelvin and Rankine are absolute temperature scales; Kelvin is the SI base unit for temperature and Rankine is a Fahrenheit-based absolute scale commonly used in some engineering contexts.",
      "The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship and is exact: one degree Rankine equals 5/9 of a kelvin, or equivalently one kelvin equals 9/5 degrees Rankine. This page provides the formula, clear examples, and practical accuracy and traceability notes for instrument calibration and reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the exact ratio between the Kelvin and Rankine scales. Because both Kelvin and Rankine are absolute scales (zero at absolute zero), no offset term is required—only a scale factor.",
      "For laboratory and engineering use, follow applicable metrology and calibration guidance to maintain traceability. Reference organizations include NIST for unit definitions and traceability, ISO for calibration and measurement standards, IEEE for instrumentation best practices, and OSHA for workplace temperature-related safety guidance.",
      "When reporting converted values, consider the precision of the original measurement and the uncertainty from the measuring instrument or data source. Do not imply greater accuracy in the converted result than the original reading and its uncertainty allow."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: °R = K × 9/5.",
      "Reverse: K = °R × 5/9.",
      "Steps: 1) Take the temperature in kelvins. 2) Multiply by 9/5. 3) Report the result with appropriate units (°R) and rounded to a precision consistent with the input and instrument uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "300 K → 300 × 9/5 = 540 °R.",
      "0 K → 0 × 9/5 = 0 °R (absolute zero).",
      "273.15 K (0 °C) → 273.15 × 9/5 = 491.67 °R (reported based on input precision)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion between kelvin and Rankine exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion is an exact scaling: °R = K × 9/5. There is no additive offset because both scales share absolute zero as their zero point."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to consider calibration or uncertainty when converting?",
        "answer": "Yes. Converting units does not change the measurement uncertainty or calibration status. Follow NIST and ISO guidance for calibration traceability and report converted values with uncertainty equal to the original measurement uncertainty propagated through the linear conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative values?",
        "answer": "Kelvin is an absolute scale and cannot be negative. If you have a negative temperature value, verify the unit (for example, degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) before conversion. Rankine values are nonnegative when converting from valid Kelvin inputs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Report only as many decimal places as justified by the original measurement precision and uncertainty. Avoid implying greater accuracy by over-rounding converted results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do these unit definitions come from?",
        "answer": "Unit definitions and recommended practices are maintained by national and international bodies. See the cited authoritative sources for definitions, scales, and calibration guidance."
