    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts amounts from Canadian Dollars (CAD) to United States Dollars (USD) using the current mid‑market exchange rate. It is intended for quick estimates and planning — final settlement amounts from banks or brokers may differ due to spreads, fees, and timing.",
      "Rates update frequently; results show the conversion computed at the timestamp displayed by the interface. For high-value transfers or accounting, confirm the rate with your bank, payment provider, or an official market data feed before finalizing transactions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the prevailing mid‑market FX rate (USD per 1 CAD) at the time of calculation. The mid‑market rate is the midpoint between the best published bid and ask prices on major interdealer markets and is commonly used for indicative conversions.",
      "Displayed results round to two decimal places by default to reflect standard currency presentation. For reporting or treasury use, users can increase precision in the interface. Conversion does not include provider margins, payment fees, or local taxes — those are applied by the executing institution.",
      "When cross rates are used (for example when direct CAD→USD streaming is not available), the converter uses a well‑documented cross‑rate method and flags that a cross conversion occurred so users can verify against primary sources."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Acquire the current mid‑market rate R where R = USD per 1 CAD from a market data feed.",
      "Step 2: Multiply the input amount (CAD) by R to get USD: USD = CAD × R.",
      "Step 3: Apply display rounding (default two decimal places). Note: settlement amounts may use more precise internal rounding rules or include fees."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where does the exchange rate come from and how often is it updated?",
        "answer": "The converter uses a consolidated mid‑market rate sourced from live market data feeds. The interface displays the rate timestamp. For the most recent official reference rates, consult central bank publications such as the Bank of Canada or Federal Reserve."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is the converted amount different from my bank or card statement?",
        "answer": "Banks and payment providers apply a spread (margin) and may add transaction fees or local taxes. The converter shows an indicative mid‑market result; ask your provider for the delivered rate and total fees before transacting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are results and can I change precision?",
        "answer": "Results display with two decimal places by default. The UI allows higher precision for analysis or accounting. For settlement‑level precision, use provider invoices or market data with full decimal precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool perform cross‑currency calculations?",
        "answer": "If a direct CAD→USD rate is unavailable, a cross rate computed via a major anchor currency may be used and will be indicated. Cross‑rate calculations follow standard market practice (rateA/ rateB = cross rate)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this financial advice?",
        "answer": "No. This converter provides indicative arithmetic conversions for planning and informational purposes only. For trading, investment, tax, or legal advice consult a licensed professional or your financial institution."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should businesses record converted amounts for accounting?",
        "answer": "Use the exchange rate and timestamp shown here only as an estimate. For accounting entries or audited financial statements, follow your jurisdictional standards (for example, IFRS or US GAAP) and record the official rate provided by your bank or treasury system."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or reporting limits I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "Large transfers may trigger additional bank checks under anti‑money‑laundering (AML) rules and reporting obligations. Confirm regulatory thresholds and documentation requirements with your bank or local financial authority before transferring large amounts."
