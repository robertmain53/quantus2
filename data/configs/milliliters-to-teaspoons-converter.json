    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates volumes entered in milliliters (mL) into teaspoons (tsp) using a fixed mathematical relationship. It is designed for kitchen and general household conversions where a standardized teaspoon definition is acceptable.",
      "By default the tool uses the commonly adopted US teaspoon value (1 teaspoon = 4.92892159375 mL). Small differences exist internationally and in informal measuring spoons, so read the accuracy and calibration notes below if you need higher precision.",
      "Use this converter for recipe adjustments, cooking, and approximate dosing in non-medical contexts. For clinical or pharmaceutical dosing, follow product labeling and professional guidelines."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This conversion is a deterministic unit conversion based on an exact numerical factor for a standardized teaspoon. The relationship is fixed and reversible: teaspoons = milliliters / 4.92892159375.",
      "Sources for the standardized factor come from international measurement authorities and pharmacopeial practice that define household measures in terms of milliliters. Where multiple local definitions exist, the US teaspoon is widely used as the default in digital converters.",
      "Accuracy guidance: domestic measuring spoons and informal household teaspoons vary in volume. For precise work, use calibrated laboratory or pharmaceutical measuring devices and consult standards or local regulatory guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: tsp = mL ÷ 4.92892159375",
      "Inverse formula: mL = tsp × 4.92892159375",
      "Rounding recommendation: display values to 2–4 decimal places for cooking; keep 3–6 significant figures for laboratory or formulation work and document the rounding used."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 mL ≈ 0.202884 tsp (1 ÷ 4.92892159375 ≈ 0.2028841362)",
      "5 mL ≈ 1.014421 tsp (5 ÷ 4.92892159375 ≈ 1.0144206811)",
      "15 mL ≈ 3.043261 tsp (15 ÷ 4.92892159375 ≈ 3.0432610212)",
      "If you need tablespoons: 15 mL ≈ 1.014787 tablespoons (1 tablespoon = 14.78676478125 mL)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which teaspoon definition does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the standardized US teaspoon definition where 1 teaspoon = 4.92892159375 mL. Some regions or consumer measuring spoons are different; see glossary for variant notes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this accurate enough for medical dosing?",
        "answer": "No. For medical or pharmaceutical dosing follow product labeling, a pharmacist's instructions, and pharmacopeial standards. Use calibrated dosing devices and consult applicable standards such as pharmacopeias and regulatory guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do values differ slightly between converters or spoons?",
        "answer": "Differences come from alternate historical or regional definitions (for example metric household spoons, imperial definitions, or nonstandard consumer spoons) and from user rounding. Use calibrated instruments when accuracy matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for recipes?",
        "answer": "For everyday cooking round to 1–2 decimal places for teaspoons (for example 1.01 tsp), or to the nearest common spoon measure used in your kitchen. For precision cooking or small-batch formulation, preserve more decimals."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert the other way, from teaspoons to milliliters?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the inverse formula: mL = tsp × 4.92892159375. Many interfaces provide two-way conversion; this converter is reversible with no loss in the underlying mathematical relationship, only in displayed rounding."
