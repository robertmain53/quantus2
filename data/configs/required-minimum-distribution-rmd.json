    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates required minimum distributions (RMDs) by dividing an account balance by a distribution period (life expectancy divisor). It supports owner RMDs, spouse joint-life estimates, beneficiary life-expectancy scenarios, and a simple equal-annual 10-year rule illustration.",
      "Use a distribution period drawn from the applicable IRS table or enter a custom period provided by your tax advisor or plan administrator. This tool provides educational estimates and does not replace tax or legal advice."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "RMD = Account balance ÷ Distribution period. The distribution period is the life expectancy divisor determined by IRS tables (Uniform Lifetime Table, Joint Life Expectancy Table, or Single-Life Table) or by plan-specific worksheets.",
      "The calculator uses a user-supplied distribution period so institutions and advisors can apply the exact divisor required by statute or plan rules. This design avoids hard-coded table lookups and reduces stale-data risk.",
      "Security and accuracy guidance: calculations follow standard arithmetic and numeric best practices. Implementation and deployment should adhere to NIST cybersecurity frameworks for data protection, ISO 9001 principles for quality management of calculation logic, IEEE recommendations for numerical stability where applicable, and OSHA guidance for workplace safety policy compliance when operating production systems that process sensitive data."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Enter account balance as of the calculation date.",
      "Step 2: Enter the distribution period (life expectancy divisor) from the appropriate IRS table or enter a custom period supplied by your advisor.",
      "Step 3: The calculator computes RMD = account balance ÷ distribution period and presents the result as an annual amount.",
      "For the 10-year rule illustration, the tool divides the account balance by 10 to show equal annual amounts; actual permitted timing under law may vary."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Account owner age 72, balance $200,000, distribution period 25.6 → RMD = 200000 ÷ 25.6 = $7,812.50.",
      "Example 2: Non-spouse beneficiary with distribution period 15.2 and balance $150,000 → RMD ≈ 150000 ÷ 15.2 = $9,868.42.",
      "Example 3: Account subject to 10-year rule, balance $120,000 → equal annual amount = 120000 ÷ 10 = $12,000."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where do I get the correct distribution period (divisor)?",
        "answer": "Use the appropriate IRS life expectancy table or your plan administrator’s worksheet. If in doubt, consult a tax professional. This tool accepts the divisor you enter and calculates the resulting RMD."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator know all special-case IRS rules (spouse exceptions, SECURE Act changes)?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator provides arithmetic estimates based on the divisor you supply. Special rules and exceptions (spousal elections, SECURE Act 10-year rule, eligible designated beneficiaries) require review of statute and plan documents; consult a tax advisor for applicability to your situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the 10-year rule calculation shown here the only permitted pattern?",
        "answer": "No. The 10-year rule allows flexibility in timing; this tool shows equal annual withdrawals as one simple illustration. Actual permitted timing may permit different patterns within the 10-year window and can affect tax timing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the numbers?",
        "answer": "Arithmetic accuracy is exact to standard floating-point precision. Results depend entirely on the accuracy of your inputs (balance and distribution period). We recommend cross-checking with the official IRS worksheets and your tax advisor before acting."
