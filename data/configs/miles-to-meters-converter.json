    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a distance value in miles to meters using the internationally accepted fixed relationship between these units. For general use the international mile is used; it is defined as exactly 1 609.344 meters.",
      "Use this tool for everyday conversions, engineering estimates, and documentation. For legal, surveying, or geodetic work check whether your project requires the US survey mile (a slightly different factor) and consult the cited standards for compliance and calibration guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses an exact, fixed multiplicative factor for the international mile: multiply miles by 1609.344 to obtain meters. This factor is widely adopted in engineering, scientific, and commercial contexts.",
      "When high accuracy is required (surveying, cadastral mapping, legal descriptions), confirm whether the US survey foot/mile applies and follow relevant standards and calibration procedures from national metrology authorities and standards organizations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: meters = miles × 1609.344",
      "Step 1: Take the value in miles.",
      "Step 2: Multiply by 1609.344 to produce the equivalent distance in meters.",
      "Note: For geodetic/surveying contexts where the US survey mile is required, use the US survey mile factor (see citations)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 mile = 1 × 1609.344 = 1609.344 meters",
      "0.5 mile = 0.5 × 1609.344 = 804.672 meters",
      "3.1 miles = 3.1 × 1609.344 = 4989.9664 meters"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact factor does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the international mile where 1 mile = 1609.344 meters exactly. That is the standard factor for most scientific, engineering, and commercial applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there more than one definition of a mile?",
        "answer": "Yes. The international mile (1 609.344 m) is the common standard. A US survey mile differs slightly; it is based on the US survey foot and can introduce small differences relevant to surveying and geodetic work. Consult national metrology guidance when precision matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For everyday use 2–3 decimal places are usually sufficient. For engineering use consider the measurement uncertainty and significant figures. For legal or surveying work preserve the precision required by the governing specification or authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can floating-point rounding cause errors?",
        "answer": "Yes. Conversions performed with limited-precision floating-point arithmetic can introduce tiny rounding differences. For critical work use software or libraries that support the necessary precision and document the rounding rules and uncertainty budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use the US survey mile instead?",
        "answer": "Use the US survey mile only when a contract, regulation, or geodetic dataset explicitly requires it. Many modern datasets have migrated to international units, but older surveying records and some legal descriptions may still reference the US survey definitions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I demonstrate traceability and compliance?",
        "answer": "To demonstrate traceability, record the standard used (for example, international mile = 1609.344 m), include the date and software/tool version, and reference national or international standards (NIST, ISO, BIPM). For regulated work follow calibration and documentation requirements from the relevant authority."
