    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a distance value in miles to meters using the internationally accepted relationship. It is intended for everyday calculations, engineering estimates, and documentation where a reliable, standards-aligned conversion is required.",
      "By default the tool uses the international mile (1 mile = 1 609.344 meters). If you require the U.S. survey mile or specialized legacy definitions, see the methodology and FAQ sections for guidance on when to use alternative factors."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed, internationally adopted relationship between the international mile and the meter. The international mile is defined as exactly 1 609.344 meters. This definition is consistent with international standards for units and quantities.",
      "Numeric results are produced by multiplying the input (miles) by the exact factor above. Displayed results may be rounded for readability; underlying calculations follow typical IEEE 754 double-precision behavior used in modern browsers and servers. For traceability and calibration of physical measuring equipment, follow guidance from NIST, ISO, and OSHA when applicable."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: meters = miles × 1609.344",
      "Step 1: Take the numeric miles value provided by the user.",
      "Step 2: Multiply by 1609.344 (international mile to meter).",
      "Step 3: Present the result; optionally round to the requested number of decimal places. For reporting in standards-sensitive contexts, include the exact conversion factor and the number of significant digits."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2 miles → 2 × 1609.344 = 3218.688 meters",
      "0.1 mile → 0.1 × 1609.344 = 160.9344 meters",
      "5.5 miles → 5.5 × 1609.344 = 8851.392 meters"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which mile definition does this converter use?",
        "answer": "It uses the international mile, defined as exactly 1 609.344 meters. The international mile is the standard used in most scientific, engineering, and international contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the U.S. survey mile and when should I use it?",
        "answer": "The U.S. survey mile is a legacy unit used in some cadastral and surveying records; its value is close but not identical to the international mile. Use the U.S. survey mile only when working with historical survey data or systems that explicitly require it. For most applications, the international mile is correct."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits are reliable in the result?",
        "answer": "Calculations follow IEEE 754 double precision, which provides about 15 to 17 decimal digits of precision. For practical reporting, choose a number of significant digits appropriate to your measurement accuracy and document the precision and conversion factor used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this converter be used for legal, safety, or compliance documents?",
        "answer": "Yes, but when results are used in regulated or safety-critical documents, include the exact conversion factor, rounding rules, and a citation to the standards used. Follow calibration and measurement traceability guidance from NIST, ISO, and relevant regulatory authorities such as OSHA."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits on input size or numeric range?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion itself is linear and unbounded, but practical limits depend on the environment (browser or server) and floating-point representation. Very large values may lose integer precision; for extremely large or high-precision requirements, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic libraries and document numeric assumptions."
