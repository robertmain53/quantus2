    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a distance given in miles to meters using the internationally recognized conversion factor for the international statute mile. It is intended for quick, repeatable conversions for engineering, education, and general use.",
      "Conversions are computed from the fixed relationship between the international mile and the metre. The tool reports numerical results and guidance on rounding, expected precision, and potential sources of error when converting measured distances."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the exact defined relationship between the international statute mile and the metre: 1 mile = 1609.344 metres. This factor is the accepted conversion used in engineering and international standards.",
      "Displayed results are numeric multiplications performed in floating-point arithmetic. For display and reporting, users should choose an appropriate number of significant digits based on their measurement context and standards cited below.",
      "For traceability and best practice, users requiring legal or safety-level accuracy should confirm measurement device calibration and follow applicable standards for measurement uncertainty and documentation (see citations)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: meters = miles × 1609.344",
      "Step 1: Accept input value in miles (any nonnegative real number).",
      "Step 2: Multiply the input by 1609.344 to produce metres.",
      "Step 3: Round or format the result to the number of decimal places or significant figures appropriate for your use case."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 mile => 1609.344 metres",
      "0.5 mile => 804.672 metres",
      "5 miles => 8046.72 metres",
      "26.21875 miles (approximate marathon) => 42195.0 metres"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use miles × 1609.344 to obtain metres. The conversion factor is exact for the international statute mile.",
      "Choose display precision to match measurement uncertainty. For metrology or regulatory contexts, follow the cited standards for calibration and uncertainty reporting."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is 1 mile exactly 1609.344 metres?",
        "answer": "Yes. The international statute mile is defined such that 1 mile = 1609.344 metres. That conversion factor is the standard used in engineering and most legal contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do results sometimes show small rounding differences?",
        "answer": "Display rounding and binary floating-point representation (IEEE 754) can produce visually small differences when showing many decimal places. For critical work, format results to the required number of significant figures and document rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I keep?",
        "answer": "That depends on the measurement context. For everyday use, 2–3 decimal places are typically sufficient. For engineering or scientific work, follow your project's required significant figures and uncertainty budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a mathematical unit conversion. Measurement uncertainty comes from instruments and procedures; follow metrology standards and calibrate instruments as required to quantify uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Yes, numerically, but very large or very small values may be subject to floating-point precision limits. For high-precision needs, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or a metrology-grade tool and consult IEEE 754 and relevant standards."
