    "introduction": [
      "Convert amounts between US dollars (USD) and Australian dollars (AUD) quickly using current mid-market exchange rates. Results show how the base conversion is calculated and what adjustments can affect the cash you receive.",
      "This converter reports the straight currency conversion (amount × exchange rate). It also explains typical provider adjustments (spread, fixed fees), rounding by minor currency units, and where exchange rates are sourced and refreshed."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary reference rate: the mid-market (interbank) USD→AUD rate published by major central and statistical authorities. For auditing and traceability we reference official sources such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
      "Provider adjustments: commercial rates can differ from the mid-market rate because of spreads, commission and fixed fees. When a provider rate is shown it is typically: provider_rate = mid_market_rate × (1 ± spread) ± commission_adjustment.",
      "Precision and rounding: currency amounts are rounded to the minor unit (two decimal places for both USD and AUD by ISO 4217 convention). For accounting-grade reporting, follow measurement uncertainty best practices (see NIST guidance).",
      "Refresh cadence: rates update periodically. High-frequency or large-value transactions should use confirmed live rates from regulated financial institutions before settlement."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Base conversion: Converted amount (AUD) = Amount (USD) × Exchange rate (AUD per USD).",
      "Step 2 — Apply provider adjustments (if applicable): Final payout = Converted amount × (1 ± spread) − fixed fees. Providers may apply markup on the mid-market rate rather than a separate fee.",
      "Step 3 — Rounding: Round the final payout to 2 decimal places (AUD cents) or per the receiving instrument's rules."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100 USD × mid-market rate (AUD per USD) = converted AUD before provider adjustments and fees.",
      "Example 2: If mid-market rate = 1.50 AUD/USD, 100 USD converts to 150.00 AUD. If a provider applies a 0.5% spread, provider payout ≈ 150.00 × 0.995 = 149.25 AUD before fixed fees."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This tool gives a transparent base conversion from USD to AUD and explains common adjustments that affect the amount you receive. Always confirm large transfers with your payment provider for an exact live quote.",
      "Cite official sources for reconciliation and compliance; use live provider rates for settlement instructions."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exchange rate does this converter use?",
        "answer": "The converter shows the mid-market exchange rate (interbank) as the base reference. For settlement you may receive a different commercial rate that includes a provider spread or fees."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I see different rates on different services?",
        "answer": "Differences come from timing (rate refresh cadence), liquidity conditions, and provider markups (spreads and fees). Regulated payment providers and banks often add a margin to the mid-market rate to cover costs and profit."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often are rates updated?",
        "answer": "Rates are refreshed periodically. For time-sensitive or large-value transfers, use a live confirmed quote from your bank or payment provider because market rates can change between quote and settlement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are fees and spreads applied?",
        "answer": "Providers either apply a markup to the exchange rate (a spread) or charge a separate fixed fee — sometimes both. The effective payout is: payout = amount × provider_rate − fixed_fee, where provider_rate = mid_market_rate × (1 ± spread)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is rounding handled?",
        "answer": "Final amounts are rounded to the currency's minor unit (two decimal places for USD and AUD per ISO 4217). For accounting or regulatory reporting, follow NIST guidance on expressing measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter suitable for accounting or regulatory records?",
        "answer": "This converter provides a reproducible base conversion and explanatory notes suitable for preliminary reconciliation. For official accounting, use documented live quotes from regulated institutions and record timestamps, source, and any spreads or fees applied."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which authoritative sources back these practices?",
        "answer": "Authoritative references include currency code standards (ISO 4217), central-bank published exchange rates (e.g., Reserve Bank of Australia and US Federal Reserve), and best-practice measurement guidance from NIST."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I lock a rate for a future transfer?",
        "answer": "Rate locking is offered by payment providers through forward contracts or guaranteed quotes. This converter does not lock rates — contact a regulated provider to obtain and document a fixed-rate agreement."
