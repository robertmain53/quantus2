    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts energy values from kilojoules (kJ) to megajoules (MJ) using the international system of units (SI). It applies the standard SI prefix relationship between kilo (10^3) and mega (10^6).",
      "The tool is intended for engineers, researchers, students, and practitioners who need a reliable, traceable numeric conversion for reporting, calculations, or documentation. The underlying conversion is exact in algebraic form; guidance on rounding and uncertainty is provided for measurement and reporting contexts.",
      "References to SI conventions and measurement practice are included to support traceability and alignment with standards from international and U.S. authorities."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "SI prefixes define kilo as 10^3 and mega as 10^6. Converting between kilojoules and megajoules therefore reduces to scaling by powers of ten. This follows the SI brochure and NIST guidance on unit prefixes and base units.",
      "We present the algebraic relationship and offer best practices for numerical precision: retain sufficient significant figures during intermediate work, then round to the number of significant digits justified by the measurement uncertainty or reporting standard.",
      "For metrology, regulatory reporting, or instrumentation outputs, consult calibration certificates, manufacturer's uncertainty, and applicable standards (for example ISO standards on quantities and units) when declaring converted values in formal documents."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: MJ = kJ × 0.001",
      "Inverse formula: kJ = MJ × 1000",
      "Explanation: 1 MJ = 1,000 kJ because mega (10^6) divided by kilo (10^3) equals 10^3."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 500 kJ to MJ: 500 × 0.001 = 0.5 MJ.",
      "Convert 1,234 kJ to MJ: 1,234 × 0.001 = 1.234 MJ.",
      "To report with two significant figures when measurement uncertainty allows: 1,234 kJ → 1.23 MJ (if permissible by the uncertainty budget)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact mathematical relationship between kilojoules and megajoules?",
        "answer": "1 kilojoule (kJ) equals 0.001 megajoule (MJ). Equivalently, 1 megajoule equals 1,000 kilojoules. This follows directly from SI prefix definitions (kilo = 10^3, mega = 10^6)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round converted values and how many significant figures should I keep?",
        "answer": "Round based on the uncertainty of the original measurement or the precision required for reporting. Keep at least as many significant figures as justified by instrument uncertainty or the conventions of your discipline. When in doubt for engineering reports, keep three significant figures during calculation and apply final rounding according to uncertainty analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "This tool performs exact arithmetic scaling between units. It does not estimate instrument uncertainty or calibration drift. For compliance, use your instrument calibration certificate, propagate measurement uncertainty through the conversion, and document traceability to national metrology references such as NIST or accredited labs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is using SI prefixes recommended for conversions?",
        "answer": "SI prefixes provide consistent, universally accepted scaling factors that avoid ambiguity. Using prefix-based conversion reduces error and aligns with international standards maintained by bodies such as the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and guidance published by NIST."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert energy values from other units (e.g., joules, kilocalories) with this tool?",
        "answer": "This converter specifically maps kilojoules to megajoules. For other unit conversions, use a tool or module that supports those unit identifiers; conversions to/from joules, calories, electronvolts, or BTU require the appropriate fixed factors and traceable references."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references on unit definitions and prefixes?",
        "answer": "Authoritative references include the SI brochure published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and guidance on units and measurement from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For standards used in technical reporting, consult ISO documents relevant to quantities and units."

    "summary": [
      "Converting kJ to MJ is a simple, exact scaling by 0.001 based on SI prefixes.",
      "Apply appropriate rounding and uncertainty propagation for metrology and regulated reporting, and reference NIST/BIPM/ISO guidance where traceability is required."
