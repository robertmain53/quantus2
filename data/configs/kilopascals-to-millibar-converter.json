    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a pressure value expressed in kilopascals (kPa) to millibars (mbar). The mathematical relationship between these units is fixed and exact: 1 kPa equals 10 mbar.",
      "The numeric conversion is exact, but when working with real instrument readings you must account for measurement uncertainty, calibration status, and environmental conditions. Guidance below references measurement and calibration standards used in laboratories and industry."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the defined SI relationship between pascals, kilopascals, and the millibar. Millibar is a derived unit where 1 mbar = 100 pascals and 1 kPa = 1000 pascals, giving the exact factor 1 kPa = 10 mbar.",
      "While the arithmetic conversion is exact, good practice for metrology and compliance is to document the originating instrument's accuracy, calibration traceability, and the number of significant digits reported. For calibration and lab traceability follow ISO 17025 and NIST-traceable procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with pressure in kilopascals (kPa).",
      "Step 2: Multiply the kPa value by 10 to get millibars (mbar). Example formula: mbar = kPa × 10.",
      "Reverse conversion: kPa = mbar ÷ 10."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1.2 kPa → 1.2 × 10 = 12.0 mbar.",
      "Example 2: 101.325 kPa → 101.325 × 10 = 1013.25 mbar (standard atmospheric pressure rounded to typical sensor precision)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor approximate or exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor between kilopascals and millibars is exact: 1 kPa = 10 mbar. Any rounding error comes from numeric formatting, not the conversion itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do converted results sometimes include uncertainty?",
        "answer": "Converted values inherit uncertainty from the measured input. Instrument accuracy, calibration uncertainty, and environmental conditions determine the meaningful number of significant digits. The conversion does not remove measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards should I follow for calibration and reporting?",
        "answer": "For calibration laboratories and traceability use ISO 17025. For SI unit definitions and best practice consult NIST guidance. In safety-critical or regulated environments, follow applicable industry and OSHA guidance for pressure systems."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I display?",
        "answer": "Display precision based on the input measurement's uncertainty. Do not imply greater accuracy than the instrument provides; for example, if the sensor accuracy is ±0.1 kPa, reporting beyond one decimal in kPa or beyond one decimal in the converted mbar value may be misleading."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does temperature or altitude affect the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between units is independent of temperature and altitude. However, instrument readings can be affected by environmental conditions; compensate or calibrate sensors as required for accurate measurement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for safety calculations?",
        "answer": "You may use the numeric conversion in safety calculations, but always combine it with documented instrument uncertainty, calibration records, and applicable safety standards. For legal or regulatory compliance, rely on certified measurements and traceable calibration."
