    "introduction": [
      "Hertz (Hz) is the SI unit of frequency and represents cycles per second. Terahertz (THz) is a derived unit equal to 10^12 hertz and is commonly used in optics, spectroscopy, and high-frequency communications.",
      "This converter applies the SI definition so results are consistent with national metrology guidance. Guidance on precision, scientific notation, and traceability to standards (for measurement equipment and calibration) is included to help engineers and scientists use converted values correctly."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed SI relationship between hertz and terahertz: 1 THz = 1 × 10^12 Hz. Converting is a single-step arithmetic operation performed exactly in binary/decimal arithmetic by dividing or multiplying by 1e12.",
      "When presenting converted values, preserve the number of significant figures that reflect your original measurement or data source. For measured data, include instrument uncertainty and calibration traceability (for example, calibration certificates traceable to NIST or the national metrology institute in your country).",
      "For very large or very small frequencies use scientific notation to avoid loss of precision in display or downstream calculation. If you are converting values used for regulatory or safety assessments (radiofrequency exposure, communications licensing), consult the appropriate regulatory body for limits and measurement methodology."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Exact relationships: 1 terahertz (THz) = 1 × 10^12 hertz (Hz).",
      "To convert Hz to THz: THz = Hz ÷ 1e12. To convert THz to Hz: Hz = THz × 1e12.",
      "Use scientific notation for compact representation (for example, 5×10^11 Hz = 0.5 THz) and retain significant figures from the original measurement when reporting results."

    "examples": [
      "500000000000 Hz → 0.5 THz",
      "1 Hz → 1e-12 THz",
      "3.5e14 Hz → 350 THz"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Conversion is a fixed-factor operation: divide by 1e12 to go from Hz to THz and multiply by 1e12 to go the other way.",
      "Preserve measurement precision and include calibration/uncertainty information when converted values are used in engineering, metrology, or regulatory contexts."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between hertz and terahertz?",
        "answer": "1 THz = 1 × 10^12 Hz. To convert Hz to THz divide by 1e12; to convert THz to Hz multiply by 1e12."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle significant figures when converting?",
        "answer": "Carry the significant figures from your original measurement. Do not invent extra precision by converting and reporting more digits than the instrument justifies. If uncertainty is known, report converted value with its uncertainty and the same confidence level."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I display very large or very small frequency values?",
        "answer": "Use scientific notation for clarity and to prevent formatting or rounding errors. For example, 1 Hz is 1.00e0 Hz or 1e-12 THz, and 3.5e14 Hz can be shown as 350 THz."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory limits tied to frequency units I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "Unit conversion itself has no regulatory limits. However, applications that use frequency values—such as RF exposure, emissions, or licensing—are regulated. Consult the relevant regulatory agency for limits and measurement methods; measurement results used for compliance should be traceable to national standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What measurement considerations matter when reporting converted frequencies?",
        "answer": "Account for instrument bandwidth, resolution, and calibration uncertainty. Ensure equipment is calibrated with a traceable standard and include the calibration date and uncertainty when reporting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative guidance on units and traceability?",
        "answer": "Refer to national and international metrology and standards organizations for SI unit definitions and calibration guidance. Use resources from those organizations for up-to-date practices on units and measurement traceability."
