    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a temperature value from degrees Fahrenheit (°F) to degrees Rankine (°R). Rankine is an absolute temperature scale using the Fahrenheit degree size and is commonly used in some engineering fields in the United States and in thermodynamic calculations that use Fahrenheit-based units.",
      "Use this converter for quick, deterministic conversions where the relationship between Fahrenheit and Rankine is fixed. For measurement and compliance tasks, review instrument calibration, specified measurement uncertainty, and any regulatory temperature reporting rules before relying on a single converted value."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed offset relationship between the Fahrenheit and Rankine scales. Rankine is an absolute scale with zero at absolute zero; converting from Fahrenheit requires adding the constant offset 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperature to shift to the absolute Rankine zero.",
      "This page emphasizes measurement best practices: apply appropriate rounding only after considering required precision, follow calibration intervals recommended by standards bodies, and document measurement uncertainty per NIST and ISO guidelines when the converted value is used for compliance, design, or safety decisions."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: R = F + 459.67, where F is degrees Fahrenheit and R is degrees Rankine.",
      "Inverse formula: F = R - 459.67.",
      "Alternate path using Kelvin: R = K × 9/5. Since K = (F + 459.67) × 5/9, both expressions are consistent."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "32 °F converts to 491.67 °R (32 + 459.67 = 491.67).",
      "-40 °F converts to 419.67 °R (-40 + 459.67 = 419.67).",
      "212 °F converts to 671.67 °R (212 + 459.67 = 671.67)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship R = F + 459.67 is exact by definition of the Rankine scale relative to Fahrenheit. However, when using measured temperatures, include instrument uncertainty and calibration error when reporting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Report decimals according to the precision of the measurement device and the requirements of your application or regulation. For engineering calculations, retain at least two decimal places when intermediate precision matters, but round only in final reported results. Always document the measurement uncertainty per NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for measurement uncertainty or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a pure mathematical conversion. For traceable measurements, follow calibration procedures and uncertainty evaluation specified by standards such as NIST SP 250-xx and ISO/IEC 17025. Include uncertainty budgets where required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative Fahrenheit values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Fahrenheit values below zero are valid; the Rankine result will remain positive as Rankine is an absolute scale with zero at absolute zero (e.g., -459.67 °F = 0 °R)."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use Rankine instead of Kelvin?",
        "answer": "Use Rankine when working in systems that use Fahrenheit-sized degrees or legacy engineering documents that reference Rankine. Use Kelvin for SI-based scientific work. Conversion between Kelvin and Rankine is direct (R = K × 9/5)."
