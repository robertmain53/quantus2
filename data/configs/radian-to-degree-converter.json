Scientific calculations use radians; practical use often requires degrees."},{"question":"How do I convert programming output from radians to degrees?","answer":"Most languages provide built-in functions: Python math.degrees(), JavaScript degrees = radians * 180/Math.PI, C: degrees = radians * 180 / M_PI."},{"question":"What is bearing in navigation?","answer":"A compass bearing is an angle from north (0°) measured clockwise. Calculating bearings requires radian-based angle math, then converting to degree bearings."},{"question":"How are radian outputs used in robotics?","answer":"Sensors output angles in radians. Robot kinematics calculations use radians. Results are converted to degrees for human-readable reports and mechanical specifications."},{"question":"What is the relationship between angular and linear motion?","answer":"Linear distance = radius × angle (in radians). This relationship requires radian angles; degree conversion breaks this equation."},{"question":"How are rotations specified in CAD?","answer":"CAD systems accept angles in degrees for user convenience. Internal calculations may use radians. Systems convert between units automatically."},{"question":"What causes confusion between degrees and radians?","answer":"Programming languages use radians; humans think in degrees.
