    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates data transfer rates from megabits per second (Mbps) into kilobits per second (Kbps) using standard unit definitions. It defaults to the SI-decimal interpretation where 1 megabit = 1,000,000 bits, which is the convention used in networking and by many vendors and regulators.",
      "Because computing historically uses both decimal (SI) and binary (IEC) prefixes, this tool also documents the binary-prefixed interpretation (mebibit/kibibit) used in some technical contexts so you can select the correct interpretation for lab measurements, documentation, or regulatory reporting.",
      "For laboratory and compliance use, follow calibrated measurement procedures and declare which prefix system you used (decimal or binary). See the citations for relevant guidance from standards bodies and regulatory agencies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary conversion follows SI (decimal) prefixes per standards authorities: 1 megabit = 1,000 kilobits, so multiply Mbps by 1,000 to get Kbps.",
      "When binary (IEC) prefixes are intended, a mebibit (Mib) equals 1,048,576 bits and a kibibit (Kib) equals 1,024 bits, hence 1 Mib/s = 1,024 Kib/s. Use the binary path only when a source explicitly uses IEC/binary prefixes.",
      "Measurement guidance: use instrument-calibrated traffic generators and sample over stable intervals, report sample interval and measurement uncertainty, and state whether values are peak, average, or sustained throughput for reproducibility in lab and regulatory contexts."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) conversion — standard networking interpretation:",
      "1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps → result = input_Mbps × 1,000",
      "Binary (IEC) conversion — when source explicitly uses mebibits/kibibits:",
      "1 Mib/s = 1,024 Kib/s → result = input_Mibps × 1,024",
      "Practical note: if a device advertises '100 Mbps' that typically means 100 × 1,000 Kbps. Always confirm the prefix system in specifications or test reports."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is 1 Mbps equal to 1,000 Kbps or 1,024 Kbps?",
        "answer": "By SI (decimal) convention used in networking and most vendor specifications, 1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps. The 1,024 factor applies only when using binary (IEC) prefixes: 1 mebibit per second (Mib/s) = 1,024 kibibit per second (Kib/s). Always check whether a source uses SI (decimal) or IEC (binary) prefixes and state which you used in measurements and reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between Mbps and MBps?",
        "answer": "Mbps (lowercase 'b') means megabits per second; MBps (uppercase 'B') means megabytes per second. 1 byte = 8 bits, so 1 MBps = 8 Mbps. Use bits (b) for network link rates and bytes (B) for file sizes unless a specification indicates otherwise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which convention should I use for regulatory or compliance reporting?",
        "answer": "Use the convention requested by the regulatory body or the test specification. Telecom regulators and consumer broadband guidance typically use decimal (SI) prefixes; when in doubt, follow agency guidance and cite the standard you used. See the FCC and NIST citations for authoritative guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I measure Mbps to report accurate Kbps values in a lab?",
        "answer": "Use calibrated traffic generators and packet-capture tools, record sustained throughput over an agreed sample window, report measurement uncertainty, and document whether values are average, median, or peak. Calibrate instruments traceable to national standards when required and follow the test procedure specified by the regulating or certifying organization."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might measured throughput be lower than the advertised link rate?",
        "answer": "Advertised link rates are often line-rate capacities under ideal conditions. Real-world throughput is affected by protocol overhead (headers, checksums), congestion, duplex settings, and application-level inefficiency. When converting and reporting, account for overhead and state whether values are raw line-rate or usable payload throughput."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I present conversions in documentation to avoid misunderstandings?",
        "answer": "Always include the prefix system (decimal or binary), the exact conversion used (for example, '1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps (SI decimal)'), the measurement interval and method, and cite applicable standards or test procedures so readers can reproduce or verify your results."
