    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a rate expressed in megabits per second (Mbps) to kilobits per second (Kbps). It is intended for network engineers, product managers, and anyone comparing advertised link speeds or converting between common rate units.",
      "The tool emphasizes the standardized decimal (SI) relationship used in networking equipment and official metrology guidance, and it explains legacy binary interpretations so you can choose the correct convention for your context."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary conversion uses the International System of Units (SI): 1 megabit is defined as 1,000,000 bits, and 1 kilobit is 1,000 bits. Therefore the decimal conversion factor is 1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps. This follows SI guidance and NIST recommendations for unit prefixes.",
      "Some legacy or informal contexts use binary multiples (powers of 1024). For clarity, the IEC/IEEE publications define binary prefixes (kibi-, mebi-) to distinguish these cases. When you see kibibit (Kibit), that indicates 1024 bits; for network throughput, vendors and standards bodies commonly use decimal prefixes."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) calculation: Kbps = Mbps × 1,000",
      "Example formula step: 5 Mbps → 5 × 1,000 = 5,000 Kbps",
      "Binary/legacy note: if a context explicitly uses kibibits, then Kb(legacy) = Mbps × 1,024; these uses are uncommon for advertised network speeds and are not the default here"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps",
      "10.5 Mbps = 10,500 Kbps",
      "0.125 Mbps = 125 Kbps",
      "To convert 2500 Kbps back to Mbps (decimal): Mbps = 2500 ÷ 1000 = 2.5 Mbps"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is 1 Mbps equal to 1,024 Kbps?",
        "answer": "No. Under the International System of Units (SI), 1 Mbps equals 1,000 Kbps. The 1,024 factor comes from binary prefixes; the correct binary term is kibibit (Kibit = 1,024 bits). For network rates and most vendor specifications, use the decimal (1,000) conversion unless the documentation explicitly states binary prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert Mbps to kilobytes per second (kB/s)?",
        "answer": "Megabits per second (Mbps) are bits; kilobytes per second (kB/s) are bytes. To convert: first convert Mbps to Kbps using the decimal factor (×1,000), then divide by 8 to convert bits to bytes. Example: 8 Mbps = 8,000 Kbps = 1,000 kB/s."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which convention is safer for technical documentation: decimal or binary?",
        "answer": "Use decimal (SI) prefixes for network rates and explicitly use binary prefixes (kibi-, mebi-) when referring to powers of 1024. Standards bodies and metrology guidance recommend this to avoid ambiguity. Include a short note in documentation stating which convention is used."
      },
      {
        "question": "What accuracy or rounding should I expect?",
        "answer": "This converter performs an exact integer multiplication for whole-number inputs and returns decimal results for fractional inputs. When reporting rounded values, include the rounding precision used and note whether the conversion assumes decimal (SI) or binary prefixes. See citations for metrology guidance."
