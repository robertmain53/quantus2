1. This is a simple_calc because break-even requires multiple related numeric inputs (fixed costs, price per unit, variable cost per unit, optional target profit or contribution margin), and the tool computes one or more formula outputs (breakeven units, breakeven revenue, contribution margin, optional margin of safety). It is not a unit conversion and does not need multiple alternative methods, so simple_calc is appropriate.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and may include examples[] and summary[] as plain arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, not Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, custom UI fields, or form for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
