    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms file transfer rates from MB/s to bps for detailed analysis.",
      "Network specs use bps while storage transfer uses MB/s.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 megabyte per second equals 8 million bits per second."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MB/s = 8,000,000 bps. To convert MB/s to bps, multiply by 8,000,000.",
      "Expressing transfer rates in bps enables precise network engineering.",
      "Understanding MB/s to bps conversion is essential for network design.",
      "This converter provides detailed data rate conversion."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Decent broadband: 10 MB/s = 80,000,000 bps.",
      "Example 2 – Fast connection: 50 MB/s = 400,000,000 bps.",
      "Example 3 – Fiber network: 125 MB/s = 1,000,000,000 bps = 1 Gbps."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why express in bps instead of MB/s?",
        "answer": "bps is base unit for engineering. MB/s more practical for file transfers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the relationship to download time?",
        "answer": "Time (seconds) = File size (MB) / Speed (MB/s). Simple multiplication."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much data fits in 1 hour?",
        "answer": "At 10 MB/s: 36 GB. At 100 MB/s: 360 GB. At 1000 MB/s: 3.6 TB."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's sustainable speed?",
        "answer": "Most connections: advertised speed ÷ 8 = practical MB/s speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does WiFi achieve rated speed?",
        "answer": "Rarely. WiFi 6: 900 Mbps advertised = ~100 MB/s real. Wired better."
      },
      {
        "question": "What bottleneck matters most?",
        "answer": "The slowest component limits everything; typical order is modem, then router, then cabling, then ISP, then server."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test my speed?",
        "answer": "Speedtest.net shows Mbps. Divide by 8 for MB/s. Or use fast.com."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is cloud storage slow?",
        "answer": "Depends on connection. Local: faster. Cloud: more convenient. Use both."
