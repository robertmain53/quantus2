    "introduction": [
      "Convert data quantities from kilobits (kbit) to kilobytes (kB). This converter uses SI (decimal) prefixes unless you explicitly choose binary prefixes elsewhere.",
      "By default the tool treats 1 kilobit as 1,000 bits and 1 kilobyte as 1,000 bytes, matching international SI usage; that means 1 kbit = 0.125 kB (divide kilobits by 8 to get kilobytes).",
      "Use this converter for quick checks when comparing network-reported bit quantities with file sizes or byte-based counters in lab reports, documentation, or instrumentation readouts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We follow SI prefix definitions and standard unit relationships: bits are the atomic unit, bytes equal 8 bits, and kilo (k) equals 10^3. References include BIPM and NIST guidance on prefixes and units.",
      "Conversion steps: convert kilobits to bits (multiply by 1,000), convert bits to bytes (divide by 8), then convert bytes to kilobytes (divide by 1,000) — algebraically this simplifies to dividing kilobits by 8.",
      "When precision matters in instrumentation or regulatory reporting, check whether the instrument or specification uses decimal (k = 1,000) or binary (kibi = 1,024) prefixes; the converter assumes decimal unless otherwise specified."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula (decimal SI prefixes): kilobytes = kilobits ÷ 8. Example: 800 kbit ÷ 8 = 100 kB.",
      "Explicit bit-step formula: bytes = (kilobits × 1,000) ÷ 8; kilobytes = bytes ÷ 1,000.",
      "Binary-prefix note: if an environment uses kibibits (Kibit = 1,024 bits) and kibibytes (KiB = 1,024 bytes), the numerical ratio between kibibit and kibibyte is also 1 ÷ 8, but mixing kilo and kibi prefixes requires converting to base bits first."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 64 kbit to kB: 64 ÷ 8 = 8 kB.",
      "Convert 1,000 kbit to kB: 1000 ÷ 8 = 125 kB.",
      "If a network reports 10 Mb/s (megabits per second) sustained for 8 seconds, the transferred kilobytes = (10,000 kbit/s × 8 s) ÷ 8 = 10,000 kB."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which definition of kilo does this converter use — 1,000 or 1,024?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the SI (decimal) kilo: 1 k = 1,000. For binary-prefixed values (kibi = 1,024) convert to bits first, then apply the 8:1 bits-to-bytes ratio. Standards bodies (BIPM/NIST/IEC) define the difference between kilo (k) and kibi (Ki)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is kilobits ÷ 8 equal to kilobytes?",
        "answer": "A byte is 8 bits. When both units use the same kilo prefix (1 kbit = 1,000 bits; 1 kB = 1,000 bytes), dividing kilobits by 8 converts bits to bytes while the kilo factors cancel out: kbit ÷ 8 = kB."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report measurements from instruments or logs?",
        "answer": "Report the unit exactly as displayed by the instrument (include the unit symbol) and note whether prefixes are decimal or binary. For regulatory or formal reports follow SI-prefixed values unless the standard or instrument explicitly specifies binary prefixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are network throughput numbers (kbps) the same as storage sizes (kB)?",
        "answer": "No. Throughput is commonly reported in bits per second (e.g., kbps or Mbps) while storage is usually in bytes (kB, MB). To compare, convert bits to bytes (divide by 8) and ensure consistent prefix usage (k vs Ki)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits or rounding should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision appropriate to your context: for engineering or lab reports preserve measured-significant digits and document rounding rules. For user-facing summaries, two to three significant digits or standard SI rounding is typical. If required by regulation, follow the specified number of decimal places."
      },
      {
        "question": "What practical checks ensure my conversion matches instrument readings?",
        "answer": "Verify the instrument’s unit label (bit vs byte), confirm whether the prefix is decimal or binary in the instrument manual, and cross-check with raw bit counters if available. When in doubt, convert via base bits (bits → bytes) so intermediate steps are auditable."
