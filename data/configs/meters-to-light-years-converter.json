    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a length value given in metres to light years using the fixed physical relationship between the metre, the speed of light, and the Julian year. The conversion is a deterministic mathematical relationship and intended for scientific, educational, and engineering use where a simple unit conversion is required.",
      "Results are presented as a numerical value; depending on the magnitude of the input, results are normally displayed in scientific notation. Users requiring certified measurement traceability or laboratory-grade uncertainty analysis should consult national metrology guidance and standards cited in the methodology."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool uses the exact speed of light defined by the International System of Units (SI) as c = 299792458 m/s and the astronomical Julian year defined as 365.25 days, where 1 day = 86400 seconds, so 1 Julian year = 31557600 seconds. The light year is computed as c × (Julian year) in metres.",
      "This approach follows SI conventions and internationally accepted definitions maintained by national and international standards organizations. For numerical constants and recommended practices consult NIST, the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), and the relevant ISO standards listed in the citations.",
      "Be aware of numeric precision limits when converting extremely large or extremely small values. Double-precision floating point (IEEE 754 binary64) is typically sufficient for most practical use, but applications requiring more than about 15 significant digits should use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or specialised numeric libraries."

      "Definition used: 1 light year (ly) = c × JulianYear, where c = 299792458 m/s and JulianYear = 365.25 days × 86400 s/day = 31557600 s.",
      "Numeric constant: 1 ly = 299792458 × 31557600 = 9.4607304725808e15 metres (approximate decimal representation).",
      "Conversion formula (meters to light years): ly = metres ÷ 9.4607304725808e15.",
      "Inverse conversion (light years to metres): metres = ly × 9.4607304725808e15."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Convert 1 metre to light years: 1 m ÷ 9.4607304725808e15 ≈ 1.0570008340247e-16 ly.",
      "Example 2: Convert 9.4607304725808e15 metres to light years: 9.4607304725808e15 m ÷ 9.4607304725808e15 = 1 ly.",
      "Example 3: Convert 4.3e16 metres to light years: 4.3e16 m ÷ 9.4607304725808e15 ≈ 4.544 ly."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why is the Julian year used in this conversion rather than a calendar year?",
        "answer": "Astronomical definitions use the Julian year (365.25 days) as a standard duration for long-term measures of time; it is the conventional definition used to define the light year as a distance unit. This ensures consistency across scientific calculations and references."
      },
      {
        "question": "What numeric constant does this converter use for 1 light year in metres?",
        "answer": "This converter uses 1 ly = c × JulianYear = 299792458 m/s × 31557600 s = 9.4607304725808e15 metres (numeric representation used for the division)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results and what are the precision limits?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship is exact given the definitions of the constants. Numeric accuracy is limited by the computing environment: typical double-precision floating point gives about 15 decimal digits of precision. For more precise needs use arbitrary-precision libraries and verify constant definitions against CODATA/NIST."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert extremely large or extremely small values with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, but results may be subject to floating-point rounding. For very large magnitudes (many orders of magnitude) use scientific notation and consider arbitrary-precision arithmetic if you require more than ~15 significant digits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter provide measurement traceability or uncertainty values?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a deterministic unit conversion. For metrology-grade traceability, uncertainty budgets, or certified calibrations consult national metrology institutes and the standards cited in the references (NIST, BIPM, ISO)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I present the converted value in publications or reports?",
        "answer": "Report the value with an appropriate number of significant figures for your context and include the definition used (speed of light and Julian year). If uncertainty is relevant, include an uncertainty estimate derived using proper measurement uncertainty methodology per ISO/GUM guidance."
