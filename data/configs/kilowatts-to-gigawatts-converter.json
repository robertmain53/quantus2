    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a value in kilowatts (kW) to gigawatts (GW). The relationship between these units is fixed by SI prefixes so the mathematical conversion is exact: 1 kW equals 1×10^-6 GW.",
      "Use this converter for engineering estimates, grid-scale comparisons, equipment specifications, and reporting. Note that the converter returns a numeric unit conversion only and does not include instrument measurement uncertainty or safety guidance for working on electrical systems."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on SI prefix scaling. A kilowatt is 10^3 watts and a gigawatt is 10^9 watts, therefore the factor between kW and GW is 10^-6.",
      "When applied to measured values, users should account for measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration, and traceability to national standards. Follow NIST guidance for SI unit usage and traceability, ISO guidance for measurement management, and relevant IEEE calibration and instrumentation standards when reporting or certifying measurements.",
      "This converter provides the exact arithmetic transformation only. For compliance, include instrument uncertainty, calibration certificates, and safety procedures required by regulatory guidance such as OSHA when measurements are taken in the field or near live electrical equipment."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: GW = kW × 1e-6",
      "Inverse: kW = GW × 1e6",
      "Steps: 1) Enter the value in kilowatts. 2) Multiply by 0.000001 to obtain gigawatts. 3) Apply rounding based on required significant figures and documented measurement uncertainty when using measured data."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 kW = 0.000001 GW",
      "1,000,000 kW = 1 GW",
      "1,500 kW = 0.0015 GW",
      "0.75 kW = 0.00000075 GW"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the kW to GW conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical conversion using SI prefixes is exact (1 kW = 1×10^-6 GW). If you are converting a measured value, include instrument uncertainty and calibration status in your final reported number."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places based on the precision of your source value and the number of significant figures required by your application or reporting standard. For measured data, round after accounting for measurement uncertainty and calibration limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between kW and kWh?",
        "answer": "kW is a unit of power, describing a rate of energy transfer. kWh is a unit of energy, equal to one kilowatt of power delivered for one hour. This converter translates power units only."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I express power in GW instead of kW?",
        "answer": "Use GW for very large power values such as entire-grid capacity, large power plants, or national-scale energy statistics. Use kW for individual equipment, small generators, or building-level loads."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify the accuracy of a measured kW value before converting?",
        "answer": "Verify instrument calibration against traceable standards, review the instrument’s uncertainty budget, and follow calibration procedures recommended by NIST, ISO management system guidance, and relevant IEEE standards. Keep calibration certificates and document measurement conditions."
