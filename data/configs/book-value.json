    "introduction": [
      "This calculator offers three linked methods for evaluating book value: Net Book Value (NBV) for individual assets, Book Value per Share (BVPS) for equity attribution, and the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio that compares market price to accounting book value.",
      "Use the inputs to compute carrying amounts and per-share measures. The tool is intended for informational and planning purposes and does not replace audited financial statements or professional valuation advice."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Net Book Value is the asset historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. This aligns with common accounting practice for carrying amounts under accrual accounting frameworks.",
      "Book Value per Share divides shareholders' equity by shares outstanding to estimate the accounting value attributable to each common share. For corporate reporting, adjustments (for preferred shares, minority interests, or revaluations) should be applied outside this basic calculation.",
      "Price-to-Book ratio compares the market price per share with BVPS. A P/B below 1 can indicate the market values the firm below its accounting equity, but interpretation requires context including intangible assets, off-balance sheet items, and accounting policy differences."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Net Book Value (NBV) = historical_cost - accumulated_depr - impairment_loss",
      "Book Value per Share (BVPS) = shareholders_equity / shares_outstanding",

    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What should I do if shares outstanding is zero or very small?",
        "answer": "If shares outstanding is zero the BVPS and P/B calculations are undefined. Ensure shares outstanding is a positive number. For very small floats, consider using fully diluted shares or consult financial reporting for the correct share base."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "The calculator performs arithmetic based on your inputs. Accuracy depends on the correctness and completeness of those inputs. This tool does not fetch market or accounting data and does not apply company-specific adjustments. For audit-grade figures, reconcile with source accounting systems and apply professional controls consistent with quality standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this calculator replace formal valuations or audited statements?",
        "answer": "No. The outputs are estimates based on provided inputs and simple formulas. Formal valuations and audited financial statements require independent procedures, judgment, and disclosures beyond the scope of this tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "What controls do you recommend to ensure reliable use?",
        "answer": "Use documented input sources, peer review of key assumptions, and version control for data. Where results feed decisions, apply independent verification consistent with ISO 9001 quality management practices and evidence-based controls aligned with NIST guidance on measurement assurance."
