    "introduction": [
      "This tool computes the Operating Expense Ratio (OER) as a percentage: the share of operating expenses relative to an income base. Two common denominator conventions are supported: Effective Gross Income (EGI), frequently used in real estate analysis, and Total Revenue/Net Sales, commonly used in accounting and corporate reporting.",
      "Use the selector to pick the denominator that matches your reporting convention, enter amounts in consistent currency units, and review the classification and advisory notes. This calculator provides a quick assessment; for audited reporting or regulatory filings use original accounting records and certified statements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Two methods are provided so analysts can match industry practice: EGI-based OER (operating expenses divided by effective gross income) for property-level performance, and Revenue-based OER (operating expenses divided by total revenue or net sales) for company-level efficiency.",
      "Expressions are simple arithmetic ratios. Numerical behavior and rounding follow standard floating-point arithmetic; for formal measurement traceability and uncertainty assessment follow guidance such as NIST's recommendations on measurement and documented processes. For quality management of measurement processes, follow ISO 9001 principles; for numerical methods and precision consider IEEE floating-point best practices. Operational safety considerations when collecting physical data should reference OSHA guidance."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Choose denominator convention (EGI or Total Revenue).",
      "Step 2: Enter total operating expenses (currency).",
      "Step 3: Enter the chosen denominator amount (currency).",
      "Step 4: Calculation: OER = Operating Expenses / Denominator. Displayed as a percentage (multiply by 100).",
      "Interpretation thresholds: example thresholds are provided for quick classification but are context-dependent and should be calibrated to your asset class, geography, and accounting practices."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example (EGI method): Operating expenses = 120,000; Effective gross income = 400,000. OER = 120,000 / 400,000 = 0.30 → 30%. Classification: Low (per example thresholds).",
      "Example (Revenue method): Operating expenses = 500,000; Total revenue = 2,000,000. OER = 500,000 / 2,000,000 = 0.25 → 25%. Classification: Moderate (per example thresholds)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which denominator should I pick?",
        "answer": "Pick the measure consistent with your analysis: use Effective Gross Income for property-level operating performance (after vacancy and rental concessions) and Total Revenue or Net Sales for company-level operating efficiency. If in doubt, document your convention and apply it consistently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the classification thresholds universal?",
        "answer": "No. Thresholds included here are illustrative. Different sectors, property types, and geographies require calibrated thresholds. Use sector benchmarks and historical data when available."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "The calculator performs basic arithmetic and is accurate to the precision of the input values and the runtime environment. For regulated, audited, or legally binding reports, reconcile with source accounting records. Consult NIST, ISO, or relevant standards for formal measurement practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common pitfalls?",
        "answer": "Mixing currencies, conflating capital expenditures with operating expenses, and using inconsistent income measures. Ensure consistent accounting definitions and time periods when entering inputs."
