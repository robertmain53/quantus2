    "methodology": [
      "All methods begin with a depreciable basis equal to the purchase price minus land value plus capital improvements. This is the starting point used for allocation and recovery calculations.",
      "Straight-line method divides the depreciable basis by the statutory recovery period (27.5 years for residential rental property, 39 years for nonresidential real property) to produce a simple annual depreciation estimate.",
      "Cost segregation allocates percentages of the depreciable basis to shorter property class lives (5‑yr, 7‑yr, 15‑yr). Each allocated portion is depreciated straight-line over its class life; the remaining balance is depreciated over the building life.",
      "Bonus depreciation and Section 179 are treated as immediate deductions in the year placed in service. This calculator applies a user-specified bonus percentage and a Section 179 election amount capped at the user-provided statutory limit. It does not apply taxable-income-based limitations or carryforwards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Depreciable basis = total_purchase_price - land_value + improvements",
      "Straight-line annual depreciation = depreciable_basis / recovery_period (27.5 or 39 years depending on property_type)",
      "Component annual depreciation = sum(for each class: allocated_basis / class_life). Example class lives: 5, 15, building life (27.5 or 39)",
      "Immediate deductions = min(section179_election, section179_limit) + (depreciable_basis * bonus_pct / 100); remaining basis is depreciated over the applicable recovery period"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Residential rental purchased for $500,000 with $100,000 land allocation and no improvements. Straight-line annual depreciation = (500000 - 100000) / 27.5 = $14,545.45.",
      "Example 2: Same property with 10% allocated to 5‑yr and 5% to 15‑yr (cost segregation). Componentized annual depreciation = (depreciable_basis * 0.10)/5 + (depreciable_basis * 0.05)/15 + (remaining_basis)/27.5."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use straight-line for a quick baseline estimate. Use the cost segregation mode to model accelerated depreciation from reclassifying components into shorter lives. Use the bonus/Section 179 mode to see the immediate tax-deduction impact, then compare remaining annual depreciation.",
      "Always consult tax counsel or a licensed CPA before filing: laws change, and elections such as Section 179 and bonus depreciation have eligibility rules, phaseouts, and interactions with taxable income."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this tool replace tax advice or official IRS calculations?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides estimates for planning and comparison. It does not replace official IRS forms, binding tax advice, or professional cost segregation studies. Use the outputs for planning and consult a CPA for filing or when precision is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the tool treat land versus building costs?",
        "answer": "You must provide the portion of the purchase price allocated to land. Land is not depreciable. The calculator subtracts land value from the total purchase price to determine the depreciable basis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are mid-month and mid-quarter conventions applied?",
        "answer": "Not in full detail. This calculator provides annualized depreciation and notes prorations. For first-year prorations under MACRS conventions, use a tax preparer or specialized software to apply the exact conventions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I enter for cost segregation allocations?",
        "answer": "Enter the percentage of depreciable basis you want allocated to 5‑year and 15‑year property. Percentages should be realistic and based on engineering cost segregation studies when accuracy is required. The calculator will allocate the remainder to the building class life."
