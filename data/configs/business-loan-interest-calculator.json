    "introduction": [
      "This calculator helps business owners estimate periodic payment amounts, total interest, and payoff timing for term loans when using monthly, bi-weekly, or other recurring payment schedules. It supports estimating the effect of recurring extra payments applied each payment period.",
      "Results are estimates intended for planning. Use the 'Standard amortization' method to see fixed-payment totals for the selected frequency, and use 'Accelerated payoff' to estimate how regular extra payments shorten the loan and lower interest. Always confirm numbers with your lender."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator converts the nominal annual interest rate (APR) into a periodic rate by dividing APR by the selected number of payments per year. For fixed-payment amortization the periodic payment is computed from the standard loan-payment formula: P = r * L / (1 - (1+r)^-N), where r is the periodic rate, L is principal, and N is total number of payments.",
      "When recurring extra payments are included, the tool estimates the new payoff duration using the analytic formula for the number of payments required to amortize the remaining balance under the larger periodic payment. For zero-interest cases the calculator uses the linear payoff formula. There are safeguards and warnings when a recurring payment is too small to amortize interest."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate equals the annual rate divided by 100 and then by payments per year.",
      "Scheduled payments equal term years multiplied by payments per year.",
      "Base payment uses the annuity formula: principal × periodic_rate ÷ (1 − (1 + periodic_rate) to the power of negative scheduled_payments).",
      "With recurring extras, the payoff periods are solved with logarithms: n_actual equals negative natural log of (1 − periodic_rate × principal ÷ (base_payment + extra_payment)) divided by natural log of (1 + periodic_rate); when the rate is zero it simplifies to principal ÷ (base_payment + extra_payment)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $100,000 principal, 8% APR, 5 years, bi-weekly payments (26/yr). The base periodic payment is computed for 130 payments. Adding a recurring $100 extra per payment reduces the number of payments and total interest — the calculator provides the estimated new payoff time and interest saved.",
      "Example: For 0% APR the periodic payment is simply principal divided by total scheduled payments; recurring extras reduce the term linearly and the tool reports the direct payoff period."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does bi-weekly always save interest compared to monthly?",
        "answer": "Bi-weekly schedules often reduce interest because they increase the number of payments per year (26 payments vs 12) which can shorten principal faster. The precise savings depend on how your lender applies payments and whether they re-amortize or apply payments in a way that reduces principal sooner. This calculator assumes each payment is applied immediately to interest then principal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will extra payments always shorten the loan?",
        "answer": "Yes if the extra payment is positive and at least large enough to cover the interest portion of a period. If the recurring payment is too small to cover per-period interest, the balance may not decline; the calculator flags that condition. For precise payoff dates when lenders apply payments irregularly, confirm with your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this a legally binding payoff schedule?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides estimates for planning only. Actual lender statements, payment posting rules, and fees can change the schedule. Use the estimates as guidance and request an official payoff quote from your lender for exact figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the calculations?",
        "answer": "The formulas used are standard amortization formulas. Accuracy depends on correct inputs and the assumption that payments are applied each period without additional fees, prepayment penalties, or rounding rules. The tool includes accuracy caveats and warnings when inputs produce non-amortizing scenarios."
