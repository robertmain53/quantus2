1. This is a simple_calc because converting AUD to USD requires a formula that uses user inputs (amount) plus a variable exchange rate and optional fees — it is not a fixed unit conversion.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, open_graph, form for converters, or other disallowed keys).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
