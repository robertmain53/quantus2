    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates data transfer rates expressed in megabits per second (Mbps) to gigabits per second (Gbps). It is intended for network engineers, IT teams, researchers, and anyone who needs a fast, standards-aligned conversion for planning or reporting.",
      "By default the tool follows SI (decimal) prefixes where 1 Giga = 10^9 and 1 Mega = 10^6, which is the convention used in official metrology and many regulatory contexts for broadband speed reporting.",
      "If you require binary-prefixed conversions (mebibits, gibibits) for low-level storage or memory calculations, consult the glossary below or use the related converter for binary units."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses SI-consistent decimal prefixes: 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. This is the accepted practice for communications link rates and most regulatory and vendor specifications.",
      "We explicitly separate decimal (Gbps/Mbps) from binary-prefixed units (Gibit/Gibibit) where 1 Gibibit = 2^30 bits; those binary conversions are not applied here unless you select a binary units tool.",
      "Displayed values are exact mathematical conversions. For real network measurements, account for protocol overhead, encoding, measurement tool resolution, and test conditions when interpreting speed figures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with value in megabits per second (Mbps).",
      "Step 2: Divide the Mbps value by 1,000 to convert to Gbps (decimal SI): Gbps = Mbps ÷ 1000.",
      "Example formula: 5000 Mbps ÷ 1000 = 5 Gbps.",
      "Note: If you need gibibits (binary) instead, use Gibi = Mbps ÷ 1024 (and convert bits ↔ bytes as needed). This converter uses the decimal 1000 factor per SI."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "250 Mbps → 0.25 Gbps (250 ÷ 1000 = 0.25)",
      "1,000 Mbps → 1 Gbps (1000 ÷ 1000 = 1)",
      "10,000 Mbps → 10 Gbps (10000 ÷ 1000 = 10)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use this converter for fast, SI-compliant conversions between Mbps and Gbps using the decimal factor (1 Gbps = 1000 Mbps).",
      "For reporting to regulators or in contracts, confirm the unit convention (decimal vs binary) required by the receiving party; many standards and government resources reference SI decimal prefixes."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between Mbps and Gbps?",
        "answer": "Using SI decimal prefixes: 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. Therefore divide Mbps by 1000 to get Gbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "When would I use 1024 instead of 1000?",
        "answer": "The 1024 factor applies to binary-prefixed units (mebibit, gibibit). Use 1024 for conversions involving Mibibits/Gibibits (Mi/Gi), which are relevant in memory/storage contexts. For network link rates and most broadband reporting, use 1000 per SI."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for protocol overhead or real-world speeds?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides a pure unit conversion. Real-world throughput will be lower than link-rate due to protocol overhead (headers, retransmissions, flow control), encoding schemes, and measurement method. Use active throughput tests and account for overhead when sizing links."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "For engineering and reporting purposes, 2–3 significant digits are common (e.g., 0.25 Gbps). For SLA or regulatory reporting follow the formatting rules required by the contract or authority; otherwise round to a precision that reflects measurement accuracy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standard should I cite for prefix definitions?",
        "answer": "Use SI prefix definitions as maintained by national metrology institutes. See NIST and international SI documentation for authoritative guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are Mbps and MBps the same?",
        "answer": "No. Mbps is megabits per second (bit = lower-case b). MBps is megabytes per second (byte = upper-case B) and equals 8 times the bit rate (1 MBps = 8 Mbps), ignoring overhead."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for legal or compliance reporting?",
        "answer": "This converter follows SI (decimal) conventions and is suitable for many reporting needs. For formal regulatory or contractual submissions, confirm the required unit conventions and measurement methodology with the governing agency or contract terms."
