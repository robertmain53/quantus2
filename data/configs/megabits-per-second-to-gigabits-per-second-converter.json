    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms data rates from Megabits per Second to Gigabits per Second, enabling network speed interpretation.",
      "Broadband and network equipment are specified in Mbps or Gbps depending on technology. Understanding the conversion is essential for speed comparison.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 Gbps equals exactly 1,000 Mbps."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. To convert Mbps to Gbps, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 Mbps = 1 Gbps, 100 Mbps = 0.1 Gbps.",
      "Broadband internet speeds have evolved from kilobits to megabits to gigabits per second. Understanding the hierarchy helps evaluate service plans.",
      "Fiber optic networks are specified in gigabits per second, while older DSL technology used megabits per second.",
      "This converter provides precise data rate conversions for network specification."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Broadband: A 100 Mbps internet connection equals 0.1 Gbps.",
      "Example 2 – Fiber network: A 10 Gbps connection is 10,000 Mbps, approximately 100× faster than typical home broadband.",
      "Example 3 – Data center: A 40 Gbps Ethernet link is 40,000 Mbps."

      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Megabits per Second to Gigabits per Second?",
        "answer": "1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. Divide Mbps by 1,000 to get Gbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "What internet speed do I need?",
        "answer": "Streaming HD video: 5-10 Mbps. 4K video: 25+ Mbps. Gaming: 5-20 Mbps. Video conferencing: 2.5+ Mbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is a gigabit connection?",
        "answer": "1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. A 1 Gbps connection downloads a 1 GB file in approximately 8 seconds."
