    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms fuel economy reported as liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) into liters consumed per mile (L/mi). L/100 km is commonly used in many countries to express fuel consumption; L/mi expresses the same quantity on a per-mile basis for direct comparison with mile-based systems.",
      "The calculation uses the internationally defined length relationship between kilometers and miles so the numeric conversion is exact (within the precision you choose). For practical decision-making, we also highlight measurement limits, rounding guidance, and best practices for comparing instrument and lab measurements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the exact international definitions for the mile and the metre. The international mile is defined as exactly 1,609.344 meters, so 1 kilometre = 0.62137119223733 miles. Therefore 100 kilometres = 62.1371192237339 miles. Converting L/100 km to L/mi divides the reported liters by that mile count.",
      "This tool performs a direct unit conversion only. It does not attempt to correct for vehicle display rounding, fuel temperature effects, or odometer calibration errors. For those adjustments, consult measurement best practices from national laboratories and regulatory guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert 100 km into miles using the exact relationship: 100 km = 62.1371192237339 miles.",
      "Step 2: Divide the liters per 100 km value by 62.1371192237339 to get liters per mile.",
      "Formula (concise): L/mi = (L/100 km) ÷ 62.1371192237339",
      "Example: 8.0 L/100 km → 8.0 ÷ 62.1371192237339 = 0.12877 L/mi (rounded)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Input: 5 L/100 km → Output: 0.08044 L/mi",
      "Input: 8 L/100 km → Output: 0.12877 L/mi",
      "Input: 12 L/100 km → Output: 0.19303 L/mi"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does the converter divide by 62.1371192237339?",
        "answer": "Because 100 kilometres is exactly 62.1371192237339 miles using the international mile definition (1 mile = 1,609.344 m). L/100 km gives liters used per 100 km; to express that per mile you divide by the number of miles in 100 km."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this conversion?",
        "answer": "The underlying length conversion is exact by international definition, so the conversion itself introduces no physical error. Practical differences arise from measurement uncertainty (fuel volume measurement, odometer accuracy, fuel temperature). For laboratory-grade accuracy follow guidance from national metrology institutes and EPA/DOE testing protocols."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might this differ from my vehicle's display or mpg calculators?",
        "answer": "Vehicle displays and onboard calculations use internal sensors and sampling windows; they may average over different distances or use rolling averages and rounding rules. Fill-up (tank-to-tank) methods and laboratory tests follow stricter protocols and will differ from instantaneous display values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for US vs Imperial gallons or temperature corrections?",
        "answer": "No. This converter converts between metric distance-based consumption units (L/100 km to L/mi). Gallons and temperature-density corrections are separate conversions; use the dedicated gallon or volumetric correction converters for those adjustments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report precision and rounding?",
        "answer": "Report results with precision appropriate to your data. For most vehicle-level comparisons two to three significant digits are adequate (e.g., 0.129 L/mi). For lab or regulatory reporting, follow the precision and uncertainty reporting rules specified by the relevant standard or test procedure."
