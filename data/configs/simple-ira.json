    "introduction": [
      "This calculator projects future SIMPLE IRA account balances using user inputs for current balance, annual employee contribution, employer contribution approach (match or 2% nonelective), expected returns, fees, and inflation. It produces both nominal and inflation-adjusted estimates and an initial sustainable withdrawal estimate.",
      "The tool models employer contributions using common SIMPLE plan conventions: a dollar-for-dollar match up to a chosen percent of compensation or a 2% nonelective contribution. Users should confirm their plan's exact employer formula and IRS limits when finalizing plans."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We forecast balances with annual compounding using a net annual return equal to expected nominal return minus explicit annual fees provided by the user. Employee and employer contributions are treated as annual end-of-year contributions for the series calculation.",
      "Employer contribution is estimated as either (employee compensation × match percent) when the employer match option is selected or (employee compensation × 2%) for the nonelective option. This simplifies plan variations; please cross-check against your plan document."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Net annual return = (expected nominal return %) - (annual fee %).",
      "Future value of current balance = current_balance × (1 + net_return)^years.",
      "Future value of annual contributions = annual_total_contrib × ((1 + net_return)^years − 1) / net_return, with fallback to annual_total_contrib × years if net_return is 0.",
      "Projected nominal balance = future value of current balance + future value of contributions.",
      "Inflation-adjusted balance = projected nominal balance / (1 + inflation %) ^ years.",
      "Estimated initial sustainable withdrawal = projected nominal balance × (withdrawal rate %)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $10,000 current balance, $15,000 employee contribution, $50,000 compensation, 3% employer match, 6% return, 0.5% fees, 30 years: calculator returns a nominal projected balance and an inflation-adjusted equivalent, plus cumulative contributions and initial withdrawal estimate.",
      "Edge case note: if net return equals zero, the calculator sums contributions linearly for growth (avoids division by zero)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this tool enforce IRS SIMPLE IRA contribution limits?",
        "answer": "No. This calculator does not automatically enforce annual IRS contribution caps or catch-up rules. You must ensure your entered employee contribution does not exceed applicable IRS limits for the tax year and whether catch-up contributions apply."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are employer contributions estimated?",
        "answer": "If 'match' is selected the employer contribution is estimated as employee compensation × employer match percent. If 'nonelective' is selected the employer contribution is estimated as 2% of compensation. Actual plan formulas may vary; use this as an estimate and verify with plan documents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are fees and inflation included?",
        "answer": "Yes. The calculator subtracts the annual fee percentage from the expected nominal return to compute a net return, and it separately adjusts the projected balance to today’s dollars using the inflation rate you provide."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the withdrawal estimates?",
        "answer": "Withdrawal estimates are simple initial-year projections using the chosen withdrawal rate. They do not model sequence-of-return risk, taxes, required minimum distributions, or changing spending patterns. Use them for planning only."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my net return is zero?",
        "answer": "The model falls back to linear accumulation of contributions when net return equals zero to avoid divide-by-zero errors. This is an approximation and noted in the example section."
