{"component_type":"converter","config_json":{"version":"1.0.0","metadata":{"title":"Convert Megahertz to Gigahertz – Frequency Converter","description":"Convert frequency from Megahertz (MHz) to Gigahertz (GHz), essential for RF communications, WiFi specification, and cellular network design."},"logic":{"type":"conversion","fromUnitId":"megahertz","toUnitId":"gigahertz"},"page_content":{"introduction":["This converter transforms frequency measurements from Megahertz to Gigahertz, enabling convenient frequency notation for modern wireless communications. It is designed for RF engineers, network planners, and telecommunications specialists.","The Megahertz is used for FM radio and older cellular networks, while Gigahertz is the standard unit for modern WiFi, cellular (4G/5G), and microwave communications. Understanding this conversion is essential for wireless system design.","This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 gigahertz equals exactly 1,000 megahertz."],"methodology":["1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. To convert MHz to GHz, divide by 1,000. For example, 2,400 MHz = 2.4 GHz (WiFi), 28,000 MHz = 28 GHz (5G), 1,900 MHz = 1.9 GHz (cellular).","Modern wireless systems naturally use GHz notation for convenience and clarity. WiFi operates at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, while 5G networks use 28 GHz, 39 GHz, and other high frequency bands.","Frequency specification documents often list bands in MHz for backwards compatibility, requiring conversion to GHz for modern system understanding.","This converter provides precise frequency conversions for RF design, wireless planning, and telecommunications documentation."],"examples":["Example 1 – WiFi 2.4 GHz band: 2,400 MHz converts to 2.4 GHz, the standard notation for WiFi frequency.","Example 2 – WiFi 5 GHz band: 5,000 MHz converts to 5 GHz for modern high-speed wireless networks.","Example 3 – Cellular 4G: 1,900 MHz converts to 1.9 GHz for cellular frequency band specification.","Example 4 – 5G millimeter wave: 28,000 MHz converts to 28 GHz for next-generation wireless systems."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from MHz to GHz?","answer":"1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. Divide MHz by 1,000 to get GHz."},{"question":"When should I use GHz instead of MHz?","answer":"Use GHz for frequencies above 1,000 MHz. Most modern wireless systems (WiFi, cellular, 5G) use GHz notation for convenience."},{"question":"What frequency ranges are used in modern wireless?","answer":"WiFi: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz; 4G LTE: 700 MHz to 2.6 GHz; 5G: 28-73 GHz. Higher frequencies enable higher data rates but shorter range."},{"question":"How does frequency affect wireless range?","answer":"Lower frequencies (like 900 MHz) propagate farther than higher frequencies (like 5 GHz). Higher frequencies require denser network coverage but support higher data rates."},{"question":"What is a frequency band?","answer":"A range of frequencies allocated for specific use. WiFi uses 2.4-2.5 GHz and 5-6 GHz bands. Cellular uses multiple bands from 700 MHz to 2.6 GHz."},{"question":"Why do 5G systems use such high frequencies?","answer":"Higher frequencies allow wider bandwidth allocations (100+ MHz), enabling gigabit-scale data rates. The tradeoff is shorter range and more base stations needed."},{"question":"How do I specify equipment for a frequency band?","answer":"Equipment specifications list the frequency range in either MHz or GHz. Convert between units as needed. For example, equipment for 2.4 GHz WiFi is the same as equipment for 2,400 MHz WiFi."},{"question":"What is spectrum efficiency?","answer":"The ratio of data transmitted per unit bandwidth. Higher frequency bands enable more spectrum efficiency, supporting more data in wider bandwidths."}],"citations":[{"label":"FCC – Frequency Spectrum Allocation","url":"https://www.fcc.gov/"},{"label":"IEEE 802.11 – WiFi Frequency Bands and Standards","url":"https://www.ieee.org/"},{"label":"3GPP – Cellular Frequency Band Specifications","url":"https://www.3gpp.org/"},{"label":"ITU – Radio Frequency Band Definitions","url":"https://www.itu.int/"},{"label":"NIST – RF Frequency Standards","url":"https://www.nist.gov/"}],"glossary":[{"term":"Megahertz (MHz)","definition":"1,000,000 Hz.
