    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts frequency values from megahertz (MHz) to gigahertz (GHz) using the International System of Units (SI) decimal prefixes. The relationship between these units is exact under SI rules, so results are deterministic and suitable for engineering, lab, and documentation purposes.",
      "Use this converter for single-value conversions, quick checks when specifying RF components, test reports, documentation, or scripting. For measurement traceability or regulatory compliance, see the methodology and citations for authoritative references and guidance on calibration and exposure limits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "SI prefix definitions determine the conversion. 'mega' denotes 10^6 and 'giga' denotes 10^9, so the conversion factor between MHz and GHz is a power-of-ten ratio. This is an exact arithmetic relationship defined by international metrology authorities.",
      "When converting measured frequencies, consider instrument resolution, stability, and calibration traceability. Frequency counters, spectrum analyzers, and synthesizers report values with instrument-dependent uncertainty; convert the reported numeric value exactly, then present uncertainty according to your lab's calibration certificate or metrology guidance (traceable to national labs such as NIST).",
      "For regulatory or safety work (for example, interpreting RF exposure guidelines or frequency allocations), use converted values together with official documents from regulatory agencies to ensure compliance. Conversion does not change the measurement uncertainty or regulatory status of a signal."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Conversion principle: SI decimal prefixes. mega = 10^6, giga = 10^9.",
      "Direct formula (concise): GHz = MHz / 1000.",
      "Inverse formula for reference: MHz = GHz × 1000.",
      "Example arithmetic: 2500 MHz → 2500 / 1000 = 2.5 GHz. This arithmetic is exact; round only for presentation to the required number of significant figures."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1200 MHz: 1200 ÷ 1000 = 1.2 GHz.",
      "Convert 0.5 MHz: 0.5 ÷ 1000 = 0.0005 GHz.",
      "Convert 5800 MHz: 5800 ÷ 1000 = 5.8 GHz."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between MHz and GHz?",
        "answer": "1 GHz equals 1000 MHz. This is an exact SI-based relationship because giga is 10^9 and mega is 10^6, so the ratio between them is 10^3."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle significant figures and rounding after conversion?",
        "answer": "Perform the arithmetic exactly, then round only for display according to your context. For measurements, preserve the instrument's reported significant figures and convert the uncertainty terms per your lab's uncertainty propagation practices. If in doubt, keep one or two guard digits beyond required reporting precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does conversion change measurement uncertainty or calibration status?",
        "answer": "No. Converting the numeric value does not change the underlying measurement uncertainty, traceability, or calibration status. Always report the original instrument uncertainty and, if needed, propagate uncertainty numerically when converting units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which instruments measure frequency and what calibration should I expect?",
        "answer": "Common instruments include frequency counters, spectrum analyzers, and phase-locked sources. Calibration should be traceable to a national metrology institute (for example, NIST in the United States) and include stated uncertainty. Refer to your calibration laboratory certificate for specifics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety implications when converting frequencies?",
        "answer": "Conversion itself has no regulatory effect, but correctly converted frequencies are essential when checking frequency allocations, licensing, and RF exposure rules. Always consult the relevant regulatory body's documentation for compliance thresholds and permitted bands."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert large lists or use this in scripts?",
        "answer": "This converter is intended for single-value interactive conversions. For batch or automated conversions, apply the same arithmetic rule (GHz = MHz / 1000) in your script or spreadsheet, and manage formatting and significant-figure rules in code."
