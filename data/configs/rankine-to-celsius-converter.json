    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a single temperature value on the Rankine scale (°R) to the Celsius scale (°C). Rankine is an absolute temperature scale that uses Fahrenheit-sized degrees; Celsius is a relative temperature scale commonly used in science and industry.",
      "Because the conversion is a fixed linear relationship, the calculator produces a direct numeric result for any numeric input. Use the guidance below for interpreting precision, reporting uncertainty, and ensuring measurement traceability when converting instrument readings.",
      "This tool is intended for unit conversion only. For measuring actual temperature in the field or lab, use properly calibrated sensors and follow applicable standards for uncertainty reporting and instrument traceability."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Rankine is an absolute scale tied to absolute zero and uses the Fahrenheit degree size. Celsius is tied to the Kelvin scale (C = K - 273.15). Converting Rankine to Celsius uses the exact linear relationship between these scales.",
      "The calculator applies the internationally recognized arithmetic conversion; it does not attempt to estimate measurement error or instrument bias. For traceable measurements, follow standards such as ITS-90 and report uncertainty in accordance with NIST and ISO guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula (preferred form): Celsius = (Rankine × 5/9) − 273.15",
      "Alternative algebraic form: Celsius = (Rankine − 491.67) × 5/9. Both forms are mathematically equivalent and yield the same numeric result."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0 °R → (0 × 5/9) − 273.15 = −273.15 °C (absolute zero)",
      "491.67 °R → (491.67 − 491.67) × 5/9 = 0.00 °C",
      "671.67 °R → (671.67 − 491.67) × 5/9 = 100.00 °C"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative Rankine values?",
        "answer": "No valid physical temperature on the Rankine scale is negative; Rankine is an absolute scale where 0 °R equals absolute zero. If a negative value is entered, treat it as a numeric input and the converter will return the corresponding Celsius number, but negative Rankine inputs are not physically meaningful."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the precision of your measurement device. For simple unit conversions, display enough digits to preserve the original precision; avoid implying greater measurement accuracy than the instrument or data support."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a mathematical unit conversion only. To report uncertainty, quantify sensor and calibration uncertainties separately and follow NIST and ISO methods for uncertainty propagation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits where the formula does not apply?",
        "answer": "The algebraic conversion is exact for numeric values. However, for extremely large magnitudes or scientific applications requiring metrological rigor, consider numerical precision limits in software and follow ITS-90-based calibration for high-accuracy thermometry."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I calibrate instruments used to measure temperature?",
        "answer": "Calibrate sensors against traceable standards and reference points per ITS-90 and ISO guidance. Keep calibration certificates and apply calibration corrections before converting instrument readings to another unit."
