Understanding both is essential for compatibility.","This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 bar equals approximately 14.5038 PSI."],"methodology":["1 bar = 14.5038 PSI. To convert bar to PSI, multiply by 14.5038. For example, 1 bar = 14.5 PSI, 5 bar = 72.5 PSI.","International equipment specifications often use bar. Converting to PSI helps North American technicians understand ratings.","Safety systems depend on correct pressure readings. Understanding conversion is critical for equipment maintenance.","This converter provides precise pressure conversions for equipment specification."],"examples":["Example 1 – Tire pressure: A European car tire rated at 2.2 bar equals approximately 32 PSI.","Example 2 – Equipment specs: A pump rated at 10 bar provides approximately 145 PSI output.","Example 3 – System pressure: A system operating at 50 bar runs at approximately 725 PSI."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from Bar to PSI?","answer":"1 bar ≈ 14.5038 PSI.
