    "introduction": [
      "This calculator models an auto loan repaid on a bi‑weekly schedule (26 payments per year) and estimates how recurring extra payments or a one‑time lump sum reduce time to payoff and total interest. Use the fields to match your loan terms; results are estimates and assume interest is charged on the outstanding principal at the stated APR.",
      "Results are provided for three scenarios: a standard bi‑weekly schedule (no extras), bi‑weekly with recurring extra contributions, and a one‑time lump sum applied now. The tool uses an annuity formula and standard logarithmic inversion to estimate remaining periods."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Periodic rate: the APR divided by the number of payment periods per year (26 for bi‑weekly).",
      "Baseline payment: standard annuity formula is used to compute the equal periodic payment that amortizes the loan over the original term at the periodic rate.",
      "Extra payments: recurring extras are added to each period and algebraic inversion of the annuity relation estimates remaining periods. A one‑time lump sum reduces principal immediately and the remaining schedule is recalculated assuming the payment amount remains unchanged."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate r = APR / 100 / 26",
      "Number of periods N = term_years * 26",
      "Baseline periodic payment = (r * L) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-N)) where L is loan principal",
      "Remaining periods with payment A = -ln(1 - r*Balance/A) / ln(1 + r) (used to estimate how many periods remain when the payment exceeds the interest due for a period)",
      "Total interest = sum of all payments - original principal (approximated via payment × periods)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator account for lender fees or changes to amortization rules?",
        "answer": "You can add one‑time fees using the 'include_fees' field to increase the principal. This tool otherwise assumes standard amortization with interest calculated on outstanding principal using the stated APR. Actual lender rules, prepayment penalties, daily interest accrual, or rounding rules may change exact outcomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do results sometimes warn about impossible inputs or produce large values?",
        "answer": "If the payment amount (including extras) is less than or equal to the interest due per period (r × balance), the loan will not amortize and the mathematical inversion is undefined. The tool detects this condition and flags the input; increase payment or reduce balance to proceed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are bi‑weekly payments always better than monthly?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly schedules can shorten payoff time because 26 bi‑weekly payments equal 13 monthly payments in a year if you keep the same per‑payment amount that is half the monthly payment. Savings depend on payment timing and whether your lender applies payments immediately to principal. Verify with your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the interest saved estimates?",
        "answer": "Estimates use standard annuity math and continuous functions; they are subject to rounding differences, lender rounding rules, how interest is actually posted, and any prepayment penalties. See the accuracy and standards section for more details."
