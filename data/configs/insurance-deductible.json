    "introduction": [
      "This calculator helps estimate how much you might pay toward deductibles and related cost-sharing for common insurance policies: health, auto, home, and equipment. Use realistic estimates for claims and service costs to get a practical outlook on annual exposure.",
      "Results are illustrative estimates only. They do not replace your policy wording, insurer statements, or professional advice. The tool assumes common deductible and coinsurance mechanics; it does not model every state rule, special endorsement, or network balance-billing scenario."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool models common deductible flows per policy type: health (annual individual deductible, family deductible, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum), auto (per-claim deductible applied per incident), home (flat or percent-of-value deductible), and equipment (per-claim deductible).",
      "Calculations use user-supplied inputs and apply deterministic arithmetic: remaining deductible is current deductible minus amounts already paid; expected deductible portion is the lesser of remaining deductible and projected annual costs; post-deductible cost uses coinsurance percentage where applicable.",
      "For percent-based deductibles (common in home/hurricane coverages), the deductible amount equals coverage amount times deductible percentage."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Health remaining deductible = max(0, individual deductible − deductible already paid).",
      "Health deductible expected to be paid = min(remaining deductible, expected annual medical costs).",
      "Health post-deductible cost = (expected annual medical costs − deductible expected to be paid) × (coinsurance % / 100).",
      "Auto insurer payout per claim ≈ max(0, average claim cost − per-claim deductible). Annual insurer payout ≈ insurer payout per claim × expected number of claims.",
      "Home percent deductible = coverage amount × (deductible percentage / 100).",
      "Equipment annual deductible estimate = expected number of equipment claims × per-claim deductible."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Are these results exact for my policy?",
        "answer": "No. These are estimates based on the inputs and common deductible rules. Actual amounts depend on policy terms, network pricing, copay structures, state regulations, and claim-specific adjustments. Always verify using your policy documents or consult your insurer or broker."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include copays, non-covered services, or balance billing?",
        "answer": "No. Copays, non-covered services, and balance billing are not modeled. For health plans, copays and provider billing practices can materially change your out-of-pocket expenses and should be considered separately."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I enter for expected number and size of claims?",
        "answer": "Use your historical experience (claims per year and average claim cost) or conservative estimates. For infrequent events (e.g., hurricanes), scenario-based stress testing (0, 1, 2+ claims) gives better planning insight."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are arithmetic results and rounding rules?",
        "answer": "Values are rounded to two decimal places for currency and one decimal place for percentages in the UI. Results are computational estimates and should be rounded as required for formal reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data stored or transmitted securely?",
        "answer": "This tool is designed for client-side calculation. If any data is transmitted or stored by a service, it should follow recognized security practices such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST guidance. Check the service's privacy information before submitting personal data."
