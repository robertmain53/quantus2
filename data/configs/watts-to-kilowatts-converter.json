    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a power value expressed in megawatts (MW) into kilowatts (kW). The relationship is a fixed metric scaling within the International System of Units (SI). Use this tool when you need a quick, reliable numeric conversion between these two units of real power.",
      "The conversion is purely multiplicative and does not change the physical quantity being measured. It does not infer measurement uncertainty, phase angle, or electrical characteristics such as apparent or reactive power.",
      "For engineering, compliance, or safety-critical work, complement the numeric result here with measurement instrument specifications and applicable standards referenced below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Megawatt and kilowatt are SI-derived units for power. The converter applies the exact metric scaling factor between these units as defined by SI conventions.",
      "This tool uses a fixed mathematical mapping: 1 megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts. Results are exact with respect to that scaling; measurement uncertainty and instrumentation error are outside the conversion and must be handled separately.",
      "Recommended reference standards for units and measurement practice include NIST guidance on SI units, the ISO series for quantities and units, IEEE standards related to power measurement, and OSHA guidance for electrical safety when measurements are used for operational or compliance decisions."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: kilowatts = megawatts × 1,000.",
      "Step 1: Accept input value in megawatts (MW). Step 2: Multiply the input by 1000. Step 3: Present output in kilowatts (kW).",
      "Rounding and display should follow the number of significant figures appropriate to the originating measurement. The conversion itself does not increase precision beyond the input value."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2.5 MW → 2.5 × 1,000 = 2,500 kW",
      "0.001 MW → 0.001 × 1,000 = 1 kW",
      "100 MW → 100 × 1,000 = 100,000 kW"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between MW and kW?",
        "answer": "The exact factor is 1,000. One megawatt equals one thousand kilowatts (1 MW = 1,000 kW). This is a defined SI scaling; no approximation is necessary for the unit mapping itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. The conversion only rescales the numeric value between units. Measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration status, and tolerance limits must be addressed separately using your instrument specifications and applicable metrology guidance such as NIST documents and IEEE measurement standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert apparent power (VA) or reactive power (var) with this tool?",
        "answer": "This converter operates on real power units (W, kW, MW). Apparent power (VA) and reactive power (var) are different physical quantities; converting them requires different context and formulas involving voltage, current, and phase angle."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose rounding or significant figures?",
        "answer": "Round results to the same number of significant figures justified by the least-precise measurement in your workflow. For compliance reporting, follow the precision rules in your relevant standards or organizational procedures and document rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the converted value safe to use for regulatory compliance and safety decisions?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact, but regulatory or safety decisions depend on measurement method, instrument accuracy, and context. Verify instrument calibration, follow OSHA electrical safety guidance, and consult applicable ISO/IEEE standards before using values for compliance or protective settings."
