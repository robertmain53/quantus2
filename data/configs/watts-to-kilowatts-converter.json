    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms power measurements from Watts to Kilowatts, enabling translation of detailed electrical values to practical energy scales.",
      "The Watt is the SI unit of power, while the Kilowatt provides a more readable scale for household and industrial applications. This conversion bridges scientific precision and practical clarity.",
      "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 kilowatt equals exactly 1,000 Watts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 kW = 1,000 W. To convert watts to kilowatts, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 W = 1 kW, 5,000 W = 5 kW, 100,000 W = 100 kW.",
      "Electrical appliances are rated in watts, but power bills typically use kilowatts. Converting enables understanding energy costs.",
      "Solar panels produce power in watts, but utility-scale systems report in kilowatts or megawatts. Converting enables proper comparison.",
      "This converter provides precise power conversions for electrical engineering and renewable energy applications."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Home appliance: A microwave rated at 1,200 W uses 1.2 kW per hour, important for energy cost calculation.",
      "Example 2 – Solar panel: A panel producing 300 W generates 0.3 kW, useful for array sizing and system planning.",
      "Example 3 – Motor power: An industrial motor consuming 50,000 W requires 50 kW of input, essential for electrical infrastructure design."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Watts to Kilowatts?",
        "answer": "1 kW = 1,000 W. Divide watts by 1,000 to get kilowatts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use kilowatts instead of watts?",
        "answer": "Kilowatts provide more readable numbers for household and utility power. It's easier to understand that a house uses 10 kW than 10,000 W."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do watts relate to electricity costs?",
        "answer": "Power consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) determines electrical bills. 1 kW used for 1 hour = 1 kWh charge."
