    "introduction": [
      "This calculator helps you estimate periodic payments, total interest, and balloon (final) payments for motorcycle loans. It supports different payment frequencies including monthly and bi‑weekly schedules and offers a mode to compute the balloon amount needed to achieve a specific periodic payment.",
      "Use the mode selector to choose between computing the periodic payment from a known balloon or solving for the balloon given a desired periodic payment. Results assume a fixed interest rate and fixed payment schedule; optional rounding and payment-timing differences may slightly change real-world values."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard time-value-of-money formulas for annuities with a future-value (balloon) term. The periodic interest rate equals APR divided by payments per year. For a nonzero periodic rate r and N payments, the periodic payment P for principal L with balloon B is: P = r * (L - B / (1+r)^N) / (1 - (1+r)^(-N)).",
      "To solve for a required balloon that yields a target periodic payment, the formula is algebraically rearranged so the balloon is expressed in terms of the principal, periodic rate, number of payments, and target payment. For zero interest rate the tool uses the linear special-case formula to avoid division by zero.",
      "Numerical implementation follows common engineering practices for stability and rounding. Calculations assume nominal APR and discrete compounding at the chosen payment frequency. Results are presented to standard currency precision; see the accuracy notes and citations for guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic interest rate = APR / 100 / payments_per_year.",
      "Number of payments = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Periodic payment with balloon: P = r * (L - B / (1+r)^N) / (1 - (1+r)^(-N)).",
      "Solve-for-balloon: B = (L - A) * (1+r)^N where A = P * (1 - (1+r)^(-N)) / r. For r = 0 use B = L - P * N."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $8,000 principal, 6.5% APR, 5 years, bi‑weekly (26) payments, $2,000 balloon → tool returns periodic payment amount, total interest, and total paid.",
      "Example 2: Same loan but target periodic payment of $150 (bi‑weekly) → 'Solve for balloon' mode computes the balloon needed so each payment is $150."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator use APR or an effective rate?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses the nominal APR you enter and divides it by the selected payments-per-year to compute the periodic rate. It does not convert between lender-disclosed APR conventions; check your loan contract for compounding specifics."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are bi‑weekly payments handled?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly is modeled as 26 payments per year. The periodic interest rate is APR/26. If your lender uses a different convention (for example, semi-monthly), results will differ; choose the payments-per-year that matches your contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are results exact for legal or tax purposes?",
        "answer": "No. Results are estimates for planning only. For legally binding figures, rely on the loan agreement and official disclosures from the lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about extra payments or early payoff?",
        "answer": "This tool models fixed periodic payments with a single balloon at the stated time. Extra principal payments, changing rates, or refinancing are not modeled here."
      }
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use 'Calculate periodic payment' mode when you know the balloon and want the scheduled periodic payment.",
      "Use 'Solve for balloon' mode when you have a target periodic payment and need to know the balloon required to meet that payment."
