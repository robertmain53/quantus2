    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms power expressed in kilowatts (kW) into foot‑pounds‑force per second (ft·lbf/s). A kilowatt is 1000 watts; a watt is one joule per second. A foot‑pound‑force is a unit of work/energy in customary units and is related to the joule by a fixed conversion constant.",
      "Engineers and technicians commonly use this conversion when exchanging specifications between SI and US customary systems, or when comparing instrument readings expressed in different unit systems. Use the guidance below for correct application and recommended precision in calculations."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses SI base definitions: 1 watt = 1 joule per second. The relationship between the foot‑pound‑force and the joule is a defined constant established and documented by national metrology institutes.",
      "This tool applies the internationally accepted conversion between joules and foot‑pounds‑force and scales by 1000 to convert kilowatts to watts. Results are numeric transformations only; they do not account for measurement instrument uncertainty or site calibration errors."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilowatts to watts: watts = kilowatts × 1000.",
      "Step 2: Convert watts (J/s) to ft·lbf/s using the NIST‑recommended constant: 1 joule = 0.7375621492772662 foot‑pound‑force, therefore 1 watt = 0.7375621492772662 ft·lbf/s.",
      "Compact formula: ft·lbf/s = kW × 1000 × 0.7375621492772662 = kW × 737.5621492772662."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 kW = 1 × 737.5621492772662 = 737.5621492772662 ft·lbf/s (round to appropriate sig figs as needed).",
      "Example 2: 0.5 kW = 0.5 × 737.5621492772662 = 368.7810746386331 ft·lbf/s."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why use 1000 in the calculation?",
        "answer": "A kilowatt is defined as 1000 watts. The intermediate step converts the kilowatt input into watts so the watt→ft·lbf/s conversion constant can be applied."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I show?",
        "answer": "Report results with precision appropriate to your input data and instrument uncertainty. For typical engineering work, 3–6 significant digits are common. For regulatory or metrology work, follow the significant‑figure rules in the applicable standard and include measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is foot‑pound‑force the same as foot‑pound used for torque?",
        "answer": "Foot‑pound‑force (ft·lbf) denotes an energy or work unit (force × distance). Torque is sometimes given in ft·lb and can be numerically identical but conceptually different because torque is a moment. Ensure contextual correctness when converting or labeling units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion include measurement uncertainty or calibration adjustments?",
        "answer": "No. This converter applies exact unit relationships per published constants. It does not account for instrument calibration errors, traceability, or site‑specific measurement uncertainty. For compliance testing or metrology, document uncertainty and traceability per relevant standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standard defines these unit relationships?",
        "answer": "Unit relationships used here follow international metrology guidance and recommended constants from national metrology authorities and international standards bodies; see the citations for authoritative sources."
