    "introduction": [
      "Operating margin is a core profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that remains after covering operating expenses. It is commonly reported as operating income (EBIT) divided by total revenue and expressed as a percentage.",
      "This calculator produces both the reported operating margin (from a disclosed EBIT figure) and a reconciled operating margin derived from net income plus common adjustments. Use reconciled margin to check comparability when companies classify items differently."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Reported operating margin uses the standard ratio: operating income (EBIT) divided by total revenue. Reconciled operating income reconstructs EBIT from net income by adding interest, tax, and common non-operating adjustments so you can compare across reporting conventions.",
      "Results are provided as currency for income figures and as a percentage for margins. This tool does not automatically detect company accounting policies; manual review of income statement line items is recommended when reconciling."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Operating income (reported) = operating_income (user input).",
      "Reconciled operating income = net_income + interest_expense + tax_expense + non_operating_expenses - non_operating_income.",
      "Operating margin (%) = (operating income / revenue) × 100. Reconciled margin (%) = (reconciled operating income / revenue) × 100."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Reported EBIT = 10,000 and Revenue = 50,000 → Operating margin = (10,000 / 50,000) × 100 = 20%.",
      "Example 2: Net income = 7,000, Interest = 1,000, Tax = 2,000, Non-operating expenses = 0, Non-operating income = 0, Revenue = 50,000 → Reconciled EBIT = 10,000 → Reconciled margin = 20%."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What if revenue is zero or negative?",
        "answer": "A zero revenue denominator makes the margin undefined. For negative revenue, margin calculations can produce negative or counterintuitive percentages. Review raw values and context before interpreting margins; large negative or zero revenue requires manual adjustment or note in any analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use reported vs reconciled operating margin?",
        "answer": "Use reported margin to reflect what the company discloses. Use reconciled margin when you need apples-to-apples comparisons across entities that classify items differently or when non-operating items materially affect reported operating income."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator replace formal audit or regulatory guidance?",
        "answer": "No. This is a calculation aid for analysis. For formal reporting, presentation, disclosure, or audit work, follow applicable accounting standards and regulatory guidance and consult qualified professionals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Results are as accurate as the inputs provided. We recommend verifying line-item definitions in financial statements. Follow quality and measurement controls consistent with standards such as NIST and ISO when using calculated results in decision processes."
