    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single numeric speed value from kilometers per hour (km/h) into feet per second (ft/s). The relationship between these units is a fixed mathematical factor derived from the definitions of the metre and the foot and the length of an hour.",
      "Use this tool when you need a quick, reproducible conversion for engineering notes, lab reports, safety calculations, or everyday comparisons. For instrumentation or legal measurements, consult calibration certificates and the relevant standards cited below to confirm tolerances and uncertainty."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the defined exact relationships: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres, 1 metre = 3.280839895013123 feet, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Combining these gives a fixed multiplicative factor from km/h to ft/s.",
      "For traceable engineering or regulatory work, follow guidance from national metrology institutes and applicable standards on unit usage, numeric representation, and measurement uncertainty. This converter provides arithmetic conversion only and does not replace calibrated instrumentation or documented measurement procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilometres per hour to metres per second: value_m_per_s = value_km_per_h * (1000 / 3600) = value_km_per_h * 0.2777777777777778.",
      "Step 2: Convert metres per second to feet per second using the international foot: value_ft_per_s = value_m_per_s * 3.280839895013123.",
      "Combined formula: value_ft_per_s = value_km_per_h * (1000 / 3600) * 3.280839895013123 = value_km_per_h * 0.9113444150329205.",
      "Note on exactness: the conversion factor 0.9113444150329205 is derived from exact definitions used above; rounding of the displayed result affects displayed precision but not the underlying exact factor."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 km/h → 100 * 0.9113444150329205 = 91.13444150329205 ft/s (commonly reported as 91.13 ft/s if rounded to two decimals).",
      "60 km/h → 60 * 0.9113444150329205 = 54.68066490197523 ft/s (approx. 54.68 ft/s).",
      "1 km/h → 0.9113444150329205 ft/s."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Multiply the km/h value by 0.9113444150329205 to obtain ft/s. For regulatory or safety-critical use, include measurement uncertainty and use calibrated instruments according to relevant metrology standards."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "The factor used is computed from exact unit definitions (1 km = 1000 m; 1 hour = 3600 s) together with the defined international foot. The numeric multiplier shown is the exact product of those definitions; displayed results are subject to rounding for presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For engineering calculations, 3 to 6 significant figures are typical. For safety signage or human-readable displays, 2 decimal places are often sufficient. For legal or calibration reports include uncertainty and follow the formatting rules in ISO 80000 and NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs arithmetic unit conversion only. For measurement uncertainty, calibration traceability, and documented tolerances reference the NIST and ISO documents cited below and use calibrated instruments with their certificates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which foot definition is used?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the international foot as defined by international agreement (1 metre = 3.280839895013123 feet). If a different local foot definition is required, apply the appropriate factor manually."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert the other direction (ft/s to km/h)?",
        "answer": "Yes. The inverse conversion uses the reciprocal factor: 1 ft/s = 1.097280000... km/h (computed as 1 / 0.9113444150329205). Use the corresponding converter or multiply by the reciprocal factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulations that govern how speeds must be reported?",
        "answer": "Reporting requirements depend on the application and jurisdiction. For workplace safety and vehicle operation in industrial settings, consult OSHA or local regulatory bodies. For scientific and engineering reports, follow ISO and IEEE recommendations on unit reporting and significant figures."
