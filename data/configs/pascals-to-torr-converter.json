    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a single pressure value in kilopascals (kPa) into torr. The conversion is a fixed, mathematical relationship based on the internationally accepted definitions of the pascal, the standard atmosphere, and the torr.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit changes, engineering notes, lab records, and reporting. For regulatory measurements, instrument selection and calibration traceability are essential to ensure values are suitable for compliance or scientific work."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The torr is defined as 1/760 of the standard atmosphere. The pascal is the SI unit of pressure, defined as one newton per square meter. A standard atmosphere is exactly 101325 pascals. The conversion therefore uses the exact relationships between these definitions to compute a deterministic factor.",
      "Accuracy in practice depends on the quality of the measurement instrument and on environmental factors such as temperature. For compliance, follow applicable standards and maintain calibration traceability to national metrology institutes. Relevant guidance can be found from NIST, ISO, IEEE, and occupational safety agencies."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilopascals to pascals: 1 kPa = 1000 Pa.",
      "Step 2: Convert pascals to torr using the relation 1 Torr = 133.322368421 Pa (exactly as used for conversion).",
      "Compact formula: Torr = kPa × 1000 ÷ 133.322368421. Numerically, 1 kPa ≈ 7.500616827 Torr."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 kPa → 7.500616827 Torr (rounded: 7.50062 Torr)",
      "101.325 kPa → 760 Torr (standard atmosphere: exact by definition of Torr and atm)",
      "0.5 kPa → 3.7503084135 Torr (rounded: 3.75031 Torr)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship between the defined units is exact given the accepted constants (1 atm = 101325 Pa and 1 Torr = 1/760 atm). Practical measurement uncertainty depends on instrument accuracy, calibration, temperature, and procedure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I sometimes see slightly different numeric factors?",
        "answer": "Differences come from rounding and how many significant digits are used. Use more digits for high-precision work. For traceable measurements, report the measured value with its uncertainty and reference the calibration standard."
      },
      {
        "question": "What measurement uncertainty should I report?",
        "answer": "Report uncertainty consistent with your instrument's calibration certificate and the applicable standard. Typical laboratory gauges may have uncertainties from a fraction of a percent to several percent; vacuum instruments and transducers vary widely."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do environmental conditions affect conversions?",
        "answer": "The unit conversion itself does not depend on environment, but readings from sensors do. Temperature, humidity, and local gravity anomalies can affect certain pressure measurement methods; consult instrument docs and calibration labs for correction factors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standards should I consult for calibration and measurement best practice?",
        "answer": "Consult national metrology guidance for traceability, ISO standards for calibration systems, IEEE documents for instrumentation practice where applicable, and occupational safety standards for workplace requirements. Always follow the specific standard quoted in your regulatory context."
