    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts pressure values measured in pascals (Pa) to kilopascals (kPa). The relationship is a fixed SI scaling: 1 kilopascal equals 1000 pascals.",
      "The calculator performs an exact mathematical scaling and is intended for unit conversion only. For operational or safety decisions, consider the measurement uncertainty of your instruments and applicable regulations or standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) definition: 1 kPa = 1000 Pa. The calculator applies that exact ratio without introducing empirical corrections.",
      "For engineering, testing, or regulatory use verify instrument calibration and uncertainty per national and international guidance. Follow NIST guidance on units and measurement, and consult ISO standards for measurement processes and uncertainty treatment. Refer to workplace safety rules from the appropriate authority when converting readings that inform hazard controls."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the pressure value in pascals (Pa).",
      "Step 2: Divide the pascal value by 1000 to convert to kilopascals.",
      "Formula: kPa = Pa / 1000. Inverse: Pa = kPa × 1000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 Pa → 1 kPa",
      "2500 Pa → 2.5 kPa",
      "0 Pa → 0 kPa",
      "-500 Pa → -0.5 kPa (negative values are valid numerically; interpret as gauge or absolute per measurement context)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between pascals and kilopascals?",
        "answer": "Exactly 1 kilopascal equals 1000 pascals. Mathematically, divide pascals by 1000 to obtain kilopascals."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the calculator's result subject to measurement error?",
        "answer": "The numerical conversion is exact. Real-world measurement error comes from sensors, transducers, data acquisition, and rounding. Apply instrument calibration records and uncertainty analysis for decisions that require traceable accuracy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on the uncertainty of your input measurement. For a sensor accurate to ±1 Pa, three decimal places in kPa (0.001 kPa) is reasonable. For less precise instruments, reduce displayed decimals accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert gauge pressure and absolute pressure the same way?",
        "answer": "Yes, the unit conversion is identical. Gauge and absolute denote reference points; ensure you keep the correct reference (gauge vs absolute) when interpreting converted values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I look for standards and calibration guidance?",
        "answer": "Consult national metrology guidance for unit definitions and uncertainty procedures, and relevant ISO standards for measurement management. For workplace safety, consult the applicable occupational safety authority and industry codes for pressure equipment."
