    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs an exact mathematical conversion between liters and milliliters based on the International System of Units (SI) prefix relationship. One liter equals one thousand milliliters, so conversions are exact in pure arithmetic.",
      "The tool also provides practical notes about precision, measurement uncertainty, calibration, and safe use of measuring devices so you can interpret results correctly when working with real-world instruments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the SI prefix relationship: milli denotes 10^-3. Therefore, 1 L = 1000 mL. This is a fixed, exact factor defined by SI conventions and implemented in computational conversions without approximation.",
      "When reporting converted values from a physical measurement, consider instrument resolution, calibration status, and applicable laboratory standards such as ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST calibration guidelines. For regulatory or safety work, follow your organisation's measurement and documentation procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "To convert liters to milliliters multiply by 1000: milliliters = liters × 1000.",
      "To convert milliliters to liters divide by 1000: liters = milliliters ÷ 1000.",
      "When displaying results, round only after conversion and keep an audit trail of the original measured value and the rounding rules used. For physical measurements, include an uncertainty budget when required by ISO/IEC 17025 or internal quality procedures."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.75 L → 0.75 × 1000 = 750 mL",
      "1 L → 1 × 1000 = 1000 mL",
      "1250 mL → 1250 ÷ 1000 = 1.25 L",
      "If an instrument reads 0.123 L with a resolution of 0.001 L, convert first (0.123 × 1000 = 123 mL) then report appropriate significant figures and uncertainty (for example 123 ± instrument uncertainty mL)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion between liters and milliliters exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical conversion is exact: 1 liter equals 1000 milliliters. Any non-exactness in practice comes from measurement uncertainty and instrument resolution, not from the conversion factor itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I round before or after converting?",
        "answer": "Convert first using the full value, then round the result for reporting. Preserve the original measured value and document rounding rules used. This reduces cumulative rounding error when chaining calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle measurement uncertainty when converting?",
        "answer": "Propagate the measurement uncertainty through the conversion factor. Because the conversion factor is exact, the absolute uncertainty scales by the same factor (for example ±0.002 L becomes ±2 mL). Follow ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guides for uncertainty reporting when required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are liters and milliliters SI units?",
        "answer": "The liter is a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI; the milliliter is an SI-derived unit representing the litre scaled by the SI prefix milli (10^-3). The SI system and BIPM provide authoritative guidance on prefixes and unit usage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What practical limits should I watch for when measuring liquids?",
        "answer": "Consider container geometry, meniscus reading, temperature (density and expansion), and instrument calibration. For critical measurements, use calibrated glassware or volumetric equipment and record calibration certificates and environmental conditions."
