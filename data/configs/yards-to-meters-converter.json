    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single numeric value from yards to meters using the internationally agreed exact relationship. The tool is intended for general engineering, design, education, and everyday use where a direct unit conversion is required.",
      "The conversion uses the legally defined factor established by international agreement. For traceable or safety-critical measurements consult calibration guidance, relevant standards, and measurement uncertainty practices before relying on converted values for compliance or inspection."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The international definition sets 1 yard exactly equal to 0.9144 meters. This is a fixed mathematical relationship and does not require empirical measurement for the conversion itself.",
      "For applications requiring traceability or legal compliance, conversions should be paired with calibrated measurement instruments and documented uncertainty estimates according to national and international standards.",
      "Relevant standards and authorities include the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), ISO measurement standards, and industry standards bodies. Workplace and safety requirements should follow applicable regulations such as those published by occupational safety authorities."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: meters = yards × 0.9144.",
      "Reverse formula: yards = meters ÷ 0.9144.",
      "When presenting results, choose rounding appropriate to your context; for engineering tolerance or regulatory work include measurement uncertainty per ISO and NIST guidance."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "10 yards → 10 × 0.9144 = 9.144 meters.",
      "5.5 yards → 5.5 × 0.9144 = 5.0292 meters."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or an approximation?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor 1 yard = 0.9144 meters is exact by international agreement. Use the exact factor for mathematical conversion; measurement uncertainty arises only from how the original length was measured, instrument calibration, or rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Display precision based on context: two to three decimal places suffices for everyday use, three to six for engineering layouts, and follow contractual or regulatory tolerance for legal or inspection reports. Always document the number of significant digits and any rounding rules used."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate equipment to use these conversions?",
        "answer": "Calibration is required for instruments used to measure physical lengths where traceability and accuracy are required. The conversion itself is exact; however, converted values inherit the measurement uncertainty of the original measurement instrument. Follow NIST and ISO guidance for calibration and uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert fractional yards (like 1/8 yard)?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert the fractional yard to a decimal first (for example 1/8 yard = 0.125 yard) then multiply by 0.9144 to get meters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references on units and conversions?",
        "answer": "Authoritative sources include national measurement institutes and international standards organizations. See the citations provided for links to NIST, BIPM, ISO, IEEE, and occupational safety authorities."
