    "introduction": [
      "Use this fuel cost calculator to estimate how much you will spend on fuel for a single trip or a regular commute based on distance, vehicle fuel consumption, and pump price.",
      "The calculation follows a straightforward engineering relationship between distance travelled, specific fuel consumption expressed in litres per 100 kilometres, and the unit price of fuel at the pump.",
      "This tool is designed for drivers, fleet managers, and planners who need a quick, transparent way to forecast fuel expenses and compare route or vehicle options."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator assumes that fuel consumption is known in litres per 100 kilometres, which is the standard metric used in many government fuel economy labels and engineering test cycles.",
      "First, fuel used is computed as: fuel used in litres = distance in kilometres × (fuel consumption in litres per 100 kilometres ÷ 100).",
      "Next, total fuel cost is obtained by multiplying the fuel used by the fuel price per litre entered by the user.",
      "For the most reliable results, use distance values taken from an odometer or mapping software and consumption values based on long-term averages rather than a single short trip.",
      "Real-world fuel consumption can differ from official test-cycle ratings because of driving style, traffic, payload, tyre pressure, weather, and the use of air conditioning or heating."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What formula does this fuel cost calculator use?",
        "answer": "Fuel used is calculated as distance in kilometres multiplied by fuel consumption in litres per 100 kilometres divided by 100. Total fuel cost is then fuel used multiplied by the fuel price per litre: cost = distance_km × (L/100 km ÷ 100) × price_per_litre."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are fuel cost estimates compared with real-world driving?",
        "answer": "The estimate is as accurate as the inputs. If you use a realistic fuel consumption figure based on several tanks of fuel and a distance measured with a reliable odometer or mapping tool, the cost estimate is typically within a few percent. Short trips, aggressive driving, heavy loads, or severe weather can all increase fuel use beyond test-cycle values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find trustworthy fuel consumption data for my vehicle?",
        "answer": "Official fuel economy values for many light-duty vehicles are published by national agencies such as the U.S. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency on fueleconomy.gov, and by transport ministries or environmental agencies in Europe and other regions. Universities and engineering laboratories sometimes publish independent fuel economy studies for specific vehicle classes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does this calculator use litres per 100 kilometres instead of miles per gallon?",
        "answer": "Litres per 100 kilometres is the standard unit for fuel consumption in many countries and aligns with SI-based engineering practice. It is directly proportional to fuel used and is widely used in official rating procedures and laboratory test cycles. You can convert between L/100 km and miles per gallon using standard unit conversion factors if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this tool to compare different routes or vehicles?",
        "answer": "Yes. Keeping the fuel price constant, you can change the distance or fuel consumption to compare how much fuel and money you would spend with different routes, traffic conditions, or vehicles. This is useful for fleet planning, commuting decisions, and cost-benefit analysis of more efficient vehicles."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator account for hybrid, electric, or alternative-fuel vehicles?",
        "answer": "The calculator itself simply multiplies distance by energy or fuel use per 100 kilometres and unit price. If you express your vehicle energy use in equivalent litres of gasoline per 100 kilometres or a comparable fuel unit and use the matching price, you can still estimate trip cost, but dedicated electric vehicle energy cost tools may give more detailed results."
