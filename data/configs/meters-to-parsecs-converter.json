    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a length value expressed in metres (m) into parsecs (pc), a unit commonly used in astronomy to describe interstellar and intergalactic distances. The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship based on the astronomical definition of the parsec.",
      "Results are presented using the exact conversion constant recommended by international astronomical and metrology bodies. The tool includes guidance on numeric precision, typical use cases, and practical limits when working with extremely large or small values.",
      "Use this converter for scientific and educational purposes. For legal, safety, or engineering-critical measurements consult the relevant standards and apply measurement uncertainty practices described by national metrology institutes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "A parsec is defined from astronomical geometry and fixed by international agreement. The value used here derives from the IAU definition combined with the internationally recommended value for the astronomical unit, yielding a fixed meters-per-parsec factor.",
      "This conversion is exact within the definition chosen (IAU/CODATA/NIST conventions). The converter performs a simple division of the metre quantity by the metres-per-parsec constant. Numerical results are subject to floating-point precision limits of the client or server environment.",
      "Accuracy guidance: follow NIST/CODATA recommendations for constants and ISO/IEC practices for numerical representation and significant figures. For high-precision requirements, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic and propagate uncertainty according to GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition: 1 parsec (pc) = 648000 / π astronomical units (AU) according to IAU definitions.",
      "Using standard astronomical unit values, 1 parsec ≈ 3.085677581491367e16 metres (m).",
      "Conversion step: parsecs = metres ÷ 3.085677581491367e16.",
      "When formatting results, present an appropriate number of significant figures and indicate scientific notation for very large or small outputs."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1 metre to parsecs: 1 m ÷ 3.085677581491367e16 ≈ 3.2407792896664e-17 pc.",
      "Convert 3.085677581491367e16 metres to parsecs: 3.085677581491367e16 m ÷ 3.085677581491367e16 ≈ 1 pc.",
      "Convert 9.46e15 metres (approx. 1 light-year) to parsecs: 9.46e15 m ÷ 3.085677581491367e16 ≈ 0.306601 pc."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a parsec and why use it instead of light-years?",
        "answer": "A parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond. It is a geometric and convenient unit in astronomy because it relates directly to parallax measurements. Light-years are useful for non-specialist communication; parsecs are standard in professional astronomical work."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion factor?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor used is based on the IAU definition and internationally recommended values for the astronomical unit. It is consistent with NIST/CODATA resources. Practical accuracy depends on the numeric precision of the environment; for metrology-grade work follow NIST/CODATA and propagate uncertainty using ISO/GUM procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "What numerical limits should I be aware of?",
        "answer": "Standard double-precision floating point can represent the conversion and typical astronomical values but can lose relative precision when mixing very large and very small numbers. For extreme dynamic ranges or where last-digit accuracy matters, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or a scientific computing environment that supports high precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I cite a standard when using this conversion in a report?",
        "answer": "Yes. For formal reports or publications cite the IAU definition for parsec and the NIST/CODATA values for constants as appropriate. For metrology and uncertainty statements follow ISO and national metrology institute guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool perform unit validation or uncertainty propagation?",
        "answer": "This converter performs a direct numeric conversion only. It does not perform measurement uncertainty propagation, unit validation beyond the stated units, or physical calibration checks. For uncertainty analysis use dedicated measurement and metrology tools following ISO/GUM recommendations."
