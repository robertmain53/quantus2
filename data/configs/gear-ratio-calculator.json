        "introduction": [
            "Use this gear ratio calculator to relate driver and driven gears, compute torque-oriented gear ratios, and estimate output shaft RPM for vehicle drivelines, industrial machinery, and robotics projects.",
            "By letting you switch between tooth-based and pitch-diameter-based methods, the tool follows the same relationships used in university mechanical design courses and NASA gearing references, while keeping the interface simple enough for hands-on workshop use.",
            "The results are dimensionally consistent but idealized: they assume rigid gears, correct meshing, and negligible slip or compliance. Real drivetrains introduce losses, backlash, bearing friction, and measurement uncertainty that you should consider when validating designs or interpreting test data."
        ],
        "methodology": [
            "This calculator defines gear ratio in a torque-focused way as driven ÷ driver. If the driven gear has more teeth or a larger pitch diameter than the driver, the ratio is greater than 1, indicating torque multiplication and a reduction in output speed relative to input speed.",
            "In the tooth-based method, the gear ratio is computed as driven_teeth ÷ driver_teeth, as described in mechanical design texts and K–12 to university-level gearing lessons from SAE and NASA-supported curricula. This follows the classical relationship that tooth count is proportional to pitch circumference and thus inversely proportional to angular speed for meshing gears.",
            "When you provide an input shaft speed in RPM together with driver and driven tooth counts, the calculator estimates output RPM as input_rpm ÷ gear_ratio. This reflects the fundamental gearing principle that speed is inversely proportional to torque, assuming no slip and negligible drivetrain losses.",
            "In the pitch-diameter-based method, the gear ratio is computed as driven_pitch_diameter ÷ driver_pitch_diameter. Under standard gearing assumptions, pitch diameter is proportional to tooth count, so this diameter-based ratio is equivalent to the tooth-based ratio when gears share module or diametral pitch. This approach is convenient when tooth counts are not yet finalized but pitch diameters are available from a concept layout.",
            "Both methods assume correctly manufactured spur or helical gears operating at the design center distance, with tooth geometry that maintains nearly constant velocity ratio as described in NASA and MIT gearing references. Planetary or epicyclic trains use related but more complex relationships and are outside the scope of this basic calculator.",
            "For vehicle applications, the gear ratio computed here often corresponds to a single transmission gear or final drive ratio. Regulatory and research documents from national laboratories and energy agencies model entire drivelines by combining multiple gear stages and axle ratios; in those contexts, overall ratio is the product of the individual stage ratios, while the underlying tooth-based definition remains the same.",
            "To use the results responsibly, you should cross-check inputs against workshop measurements: count teeth carefully, confirm pitch diameters from design drawings, and verify RPM readings with calibrated tachometers or data acquisition systems. Repeated measurements, conservative rounding, and comparison with manufacturer specifications reduce the risk of over-stressing components or misinterpreting performance tests."
        ],
        "examples": [
            "If a 12-tooth driver gear drives a 36-tooth driven gear and the input shaft turns at 3000 RPM, the tooth-based gear ratio is 36 ÷ 12 = 3. The estimated output speed is 3000 ÷ 3 = 1000 RPM, indicating a threefold torque multiplication and one-third of the input speed at the output shaft.",
            "If a concept layout specifies a 50 mm pitch diameter driver and a 150 mm pitch diameter driven gear with the same module, the diameter-based ratio is 150 ÷ 50 = 3, and the output RPM is again approximately input_rpm ÷ 3. When tooth counts are later chosen to match these diameters, the tooth-based method should reproduce the same ratio within normal rounding error."
        ],
        "summary": [
            "The gear ratio calculator implements the standard mechanical engineering definition of gear ratio as driven ÷ driver, with both tooth-based and pitch-diameter-based methods aligned to university texts, NASA technical reports, and SAE educational materials. This definition emphasizes torque multiplication and provides a direct link to how gearing shapes vehicle and machinery behavior.",
            "Because it treats losses and compliance as zero, the tool is best used for sizing, comparison, and sanity checks. For safety-critical or regulatory contexts, treat the outputs as an ideal baseline and pair them with detailed drivetrain models, manufacturer specifications, instrumented testing, and the applicable standards or guidelines for your industry."

            "Driven gear: The gear that is turned by the driver gear. Its tooth count and pitch diameter appear in the numerator of the gear ratio and determine the amount of torque multiplication.",

        "faqs": [
            {
                "question": "How does this calculator define gear ratio, and why use driven ÷ driver?",
                "answer": "This calculator defines gear ratio as driven ÷ driver to emphasize torque multiplication. A ratio greater than 1 means the output shaft turns more slowly but can transmit more torque for the same input torque. Many mechanical engineering references adopt this convention when analyzing power transmission and vehicle drivelines, while also noting that the inverse ratio describes the corresponding speed reduction."
            },
            {
                "question": "What assumptions does the gear ratio and RPM estimate rely on?",
                "answer": "The calculations assume rigid gears with correct tooth geometry, constant center distance, negligible slip, and small elastic deflections, as in classical gear theory. Output RPM is derived from ideal kinematics without accounting for losses from bearings, lubrication, or structural deflection. In real hardware, you can expect small deviations due to manufacturing tolerances, wear, and drivetrain efficiency."
            },
            {
                "question": "How accurate are gear ratio calculations based on pitch diameters instead of tooth counts?",
                "answer": "If both gears share the same module or diametral pitch, pitch diameter is directly proportional to tooth count, so diameter-based ratios are effectively equivalent to tooth-based ratios. This is a standard simplification in design texts and university courses. However, when comparing gears with different modules or non-standard geometry, tooth counts are more fundamental, and you should prefer the tooth-based method."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I use this tool to analyze multi-stage transmissions or planetary gear sets?",
                "answer": "You can use the outputs as building blocks. For cascaded stages in a conventional gearbox, multiply the stage ratios to estimate the overall ratio. For planetary or epicyclic gear trains, specialized relationships are needed for sun, planet, and ring gears; authoritative NASA and textbook references provide those formulas. This calculator focuses on simple driver–driven pairs and does not attempt to model the full kinematics of planetary sets."
            },
            {
                "question": "What measurement practices improve confidence in my results?",
                "answer": "Count teeth visually with good lighting and magnification, or verify counts against manufacturer drawings. Measure pitch diameters from accurate CAD data or inspection reports rather than outer diameters alone. For RPM, rely on calibrated tachometers, encoders, or data acquisition systems. Repeating measurements, checking against known reference ratios, and documenting instrument models and calibration dates all improve traceability."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does gear ratio relate to fuel economy and regulatory models for vehicles?",
                "answer": "Energy and emissions models used by national laboratories and agencies treat transmission and axle ratios as key inputs because they determine engine operating points, wheel torque, and cruising RPM. While this calculator does not predict fuel consumption directly, its ratios are compatible with those models and can help you sanity-check drivetrain layouts before feeding them into more complex vehicle simulations."
            },
            {
                "question": "Why does the calculator sometimes show non-integer gear ratios even when tooth counts are integers?",
                "answer": "Most practical gear pairs do not have tooth counts that reduce to a simple integer ratio like 3:1 or 4:1. A pair such as 37 teeth driven and 11 teeth driver produces a ratio of about 3.364. The calculator reports these values as decimals to preserve the precision needed for engineering analysis; you can still express them as approximate ratios if that is more intuitive for documentation or teaching."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is this calculator suitable for safety-critical certification or compliance work?",
                "answer": "It is designed as an engineering aid and educational tool, not as a standalone certification instrument. For safety-critical applications, you should treat its results as a starting point, then confirm all ratios and speeds using detailed design documentation, manufacturer specifications, relevant standards, and, where required, validated analysis or test procedures specified by your regulatory or certifying body."
