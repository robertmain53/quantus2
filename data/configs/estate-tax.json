      "This tool provides scenario-based estimates of estate tax exposure. It is intended to help you understand order-of-magnitude outcomes after subtracting debts, administration costs, and allowable deductions, then applying an exemption and assumed tax rates.",
      "Estimates are not a substitute for professional tax or estate planning advice. Laws and exemption amounts change; enter current exemption values and, when relevant, consult counsel for valuation, basis adjustments, and state-specific rules."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations follow standard accounting order: determine gross estate, subtract allowable liabilities and deductions to compute the net estate, reduce by applicable exemptions and reported lifetime taxable gifts to produce a taxable estate, and apply an assumed effective tax rate to estimate liability.",
      "Security, privacy, and development practices for this tool align with published standards for trustworthy systems and risk management. See NIST Special Publications and ISO risk-management guidance cited below for controls and system development practices."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Net estate = gross_estate_value - debts_total - funeral_costs - allowable_deductions",
      "Step 2: Taxable estate = max(Net estate - federal_exemption_amount - taxable_gifts, 0)",
      "Step 3 (simple): Estimated federal tax = Taxable estate × assumed_federal_rate",
      "Step 4 (state-adjusted): Estimated state tax = If state_has_estate_tax == yes then Taxable estate × assumed_state_rate else 0; Total estimated tax = Estimated federal tax + Estimated state tax"

    "examples": [
      "Example 1 — Quick estimate: Gross estate $2,000,000; debts & deductions $200,000; federal exemption $12,900,000; taxable estate becomes zero, estimated federal tax $0.",
      "Example 2 — State-adjusted: Gross estate $15,000,000; debts & deductions $500,000; federal exemption $13,000,000; taxable estate $1,500,000. With assumed federal rate 0.40 and assumed state rate 0.05, estimated federal tax $600,000 and state tax $75,000; total $675,000."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this an official tax calculation?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose the assumed federal rate?",
        "answer": "The assumed federal rate is a user-entered effective marginal estimate that approximates the progressive tax schedule. For conservative planning, use the top marginal rates applicable to the portion of the estate above the exemption; a tax professional can produce an exact bracketed computation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this include state estate or inheritance taxes?",
        "answer": "This tool can include a user-specified state rate when a jurisdiction imposes an estate tax, but it does not encode every state’s brackets, exemptions, or credits. Confirm state-specific rules with state tax authorities or counsel."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Accuracy depends on the correctness of your inputs (asset values, debts, deduction amounts, exemption chosen, and assumed rates). This tool provides estimates only. See the Accuracy & Compliance note in citations for recommended verification standards."
