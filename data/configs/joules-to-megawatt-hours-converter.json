    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates energy measured in joules (J) into megawatt-hours (MWh) using SI-consistent definitions. Use it to report laboratory calorimetry results, grid-scale energy quantities, battery storage capacity, or any workflow that requires precise unit conversion.",
      "The conversion is exact based on unit definitions: 1 watt = 1 joule per second and 1 hour = 3,600 seconds, so 1 MWh = 1,000,000 watts × 3,600 seconds = 3.6 × 10^9 joules. Results are suitable for engineering and regulatory reporting when rounded to the appropriate significant figures."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the fixed mathematical relationship between SI units: multiply or divide by the exact factor 3.6 × 10^9 to move between joules and megawatt-hours. This is a dimensionally exact conversion with no empirical correction factors.",
      "For practice and reporting, choose an appropriate number of significant digits based on instrument uncertainty. For example, if energy was measured with ±1% uncertainty, present converted values to two significant digits beyond that uncertainty to avoid implying false precision.",
      "When converting large energy totals (grid or national scale), report both the converted value and the original joules figure where possible. For laboratory-calorimeter results, follow calibration and uncertainty guidance from ISO/IEC 17025 and cite the calibration certificate for traceability."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: MWh = J ÷ 3.6e9",
      "Equivalent multiplier: MWh = J × 2.77777777777778e-10",
      "Reverse formula (MWh → J): J = MWh × 3.6e9"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "3,600,000,000 J → 1 MWh",
      "1,000,000,000 J → 0.2777777778 MWh (approx. 0.278 MWh when rounded to three decimal places)",
      "1e12 J → 277.7777778 MWh (approx. 278 MWh when rounded to three significant digits)"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between joules and megawatt-hours?",
        "answer": "1 MWh equals 3.6 × 10^9 J. Therefore MWh = J ÷ 3.6e9, and J = MWh × 3.6e9."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the megawatt-hour an SI unit?",
        "answer": "The megawatt-hour is a derived unit based on SI base units (kilogram, metre, second, ampere, etc.). It is widely used for energy accounting in power systems. For authoritative SI guidance see NIST's unit references."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report after conversion?",
        "answer": "Match significant figures to the least precise measurement in your workflow. For instruments with ±1% accuracy, reporting results to two decimal places in MWh is usually enough; for high-precision calorimetry, follow your instrument's calibration uncertainty and ISO/IEC 17025 guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might converted values differ slightly from my meter or energy management system?",
        "answer": "Meters and EMS platforms integrate power over time with finite sampling rates, apply internal corrections, and record rounding at readout intervals. Differences of small fractions can come from sampling, rounding policy, or metric aggregation—these are measurement and system effects, not conversion errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert to kilowatt-hours or other common units?",
        "answer": "1 kWh = 3.6 × 10^6 J. Therefore 1 MWh = 1,000 kWh. Use these relationships to convert between J, kWh, and MWh as needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or lab standards I should reference when reporting converted energy?",
        "answer": "Yes. For laboratory traceability and calibration, refer to ISO/IEC 17025. For energy reporting and measurement practices, consult guidance from national energy agencies such as the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle rounding for large-scale energy reporting (e.g., grid or national totals)?",
        "answer": "Round to an appropriate magnitude that reflects the uncertainty and audience: for national statistics, rounding to the nearest MWh, GWh, or TWh may be appropriate. Always document the rounding policy and include original joule/equipment data for traceability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for thermal energy measured in lab calorimeters?",
        "answer": "Yes for unit conversion, but ensure you propagate measurement uncertainty from calorimeter calibration, account for heat losses, and follow standard practices for reporting thermal energy measurements as detailed in metrology and laboratory standards."
