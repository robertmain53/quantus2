    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms frequency measurements from Kilohertz to Megahertz, enabling frequency range understanding.",
      "Radio frequencies, broadcasting, and electronics are specified across kilohertz to megahertz to gigahertz ranges.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 megahertz equals exactly 1,000 kilohertz."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MHz = 1,000 kHz. To convert kilohertz to megahertz, divide by 1,000. For example, 1,000 kHz = 1 MHz, 88,000 kHz = 88 MHz.",
      "Radio stations are identified by frequency in megahertz (FM 88.5) while some technical specs use kilohertz.",
      "Understanding frequency conversion is essential for electronics and radio applications.",
      "This converter provides precise frequency conversions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Radio: FM 101.5 MHz = 101,500 kHz.",
      "Example 2 – Electronics: A 500 kHz oscillator = 0.5 MHz.",
      "Example 3 – Communication: A 2.4 GHz WiFi frequency = 2,400 MHz = 2,400,000 kHz."

      {
        "question": "What is a hertz?",
        "answer": "1 Hertz (Hz) = 1 cycle per second. 1 kHz = 1,000 Hz. 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz."
