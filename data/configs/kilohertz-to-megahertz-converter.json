      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms frequency measurements from Kilohertz (kHz) to Megahertz (MHz), enabling high-level frequency planning for FM radio, cellular networks, and RF communications systems. It is designed for RF engineers, network planners, telecommunications professionals, and frequency spectrum analysts.",
        "The Megahertz is the standard unit for expressing FM radio frequencies, television broadcasts, cellular communications, and microwave systems. Converting from Kilohertz to Megahertz provides a more convenient scale for discussing frequencies in these applications, simplifying frequency band notation and spectrum planning.",
        "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1,000 kilohertz equals exactly 1 megahertz, enabling accurate frequency conversions for FM radio engineering, cellular network design, wireless communications planning, and frequency spectrum management across the radio frequency spectrum."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The relationship between Kilohertz and Megahertz is mathematically simple and precise: 1,000 kilohertz equals exactly 1 megahertz. This converter uses the standard conversion factor: 1 kHz = 0.001 MHz. The inverse relationship is: 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz. These conversions follow the SI metric system.",
        "To convert Kilohertz to Megahertz, divide the frequency in Kilohertz by 1,000. For example, 98,500 kHz = 98.5 MHz (FM radio station), 2,400,000 kHz = 2,400 MHz = 2.4 GHz (WiFi), and 101,500 kHz = 101.5 MHz (another FM radio station). This conversion simplifies frequency band notation.",
        "FM radio stations occupy individual channels within the 88-108 MHz band. Television broadcasts use VHF (54-216 MHz) and UHF (470-890 MHz) bands. Cellular networks use multiple bands (850 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2600 MHz, etc.). WiFi operates at 2,400 MHz (2.4 GHz) and 5,000 MHz (5 GHz). Understanding these band relationships is essential for system design.",
        "This converter provides practical frequency conversions for engineering, planning, and analysis work. Accurate frequency representation in appropriate units (MHz instead of kHz for large frequencies) simplifies communication among technical professionals and ensures correct equipment specification and frequency band allocation."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – FM radio station: An FM radio station transmitting at 98,500 kHz equals 98.5 MHz on the radio dial, the standard notation used in consumer radio tuning and frequency allocation regulations.",
        "Example 2 – WiFi 2.4 GHz: WiFi networks operating in the 2,400,000 kHz band convert to 2,400 MHz or 2.4 GHz, the standard notation used in wireless router specifications and network planning documents.",
        "Example 3 – Cellular 4G: A 4G LTE network operating at 850,000 kHz converts to 850 MHz, the standard cellular frequency band notation used in network planning and device specifications.",
        "Example 4 – FM broadcast range: The entire FM radio band spans 88,000-108,000 kHz, converting to 88-108 MHz, making the MHz notation more convenient for discussing the full frequency band allocation."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact conversion from Kilohertz to Megahertz?",
          "answer": "The conversion is precise: divide Kilohertz by 1,000 to get Megahertz. The relationship follows SI metric definitions where 'mega' is 1,000 times larger than 'kilo', making the ratio exactly 1:1,000."
        },
        {
          "question": "When should I use Megahertz instead of Kilohertz?",
          "answer": "Use Megahertz for frequencies above 1,000 kHz (1 MHz). This includes FM radio (88-108 MHz), television (dozens to hundreds of MHz), cellular networks (hundreds to thousands of MHz), and most RF/microwave applications. MHz notation is more concise and readable."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the major frequency bands used in wireless communications?",
          "answer": "Major bands include FM radio (88-108 MHz), VHF television (54-216 MHz), UHF television (470-890 MHz), GSM cellular (850 MHz, 900 MHz), UMTS/3G (2100 MHz), 4G LTE (multiple bands from 700 MHz to 2600+ MHz), and 5G (24 GHz and above)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are cellular frequency bands organized?",
          "answer": "The 3GPP organization defines cellular bands by number. Band 1 uses 2100 MHz, Band 3 uses 1800 MHz, Band 7 uses 2600 MHz, Band 20 uses 800 MHz, etc. Different regions use different bands, requiring multi-band phones for global compatibility."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the relationship between frequency and antenna size?",
          "answer": "Antenna size is inversely proportional to frequency. FM radio antennas (100 MHz) are meters long, WiFi antennas (2,400 MHz) are centimeters long, and 5G antennas (28+ GHz) are millimeters long. Understanding this relationship is crucial for antenna design."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does frequency affect transmission range?",
          "answer": "Lower frequencies (like 100 MHz FM radio) propagate farther and penetrate obstacles better. Higher frequencies (like 5 GHz WiFi) have shorter range but higher data capacity. This tradeoff is fundamental to wireless system design."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is frequency reuse in cellular networks?",
          "answer": "Cellular networks reuse the same frequency channels in different geographic areas to maximize spectrum efficiency. The distance between reusing cells is determined by the frequency—lower frequencies allow larger cells, while higher frequencies require smaller cells."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I convert between MHz and other frequency units?",
          "answer": "Use these conversions: MHz × 1,000 = kHz, MHz × 1 = MHz, MHz ÷ 1,000 = GHz. For example, 2,400 MHz ÷ 1,000 = 2.4 GHz, and 100 MHz × 1,000 = 100,000 kHz. Most frequency converters support all units automatically."
