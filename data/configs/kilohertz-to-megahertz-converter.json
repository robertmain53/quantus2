    "introduction": [
      "Convert frequency values from kilohertz (kHz) to megahertz (MHz) quickly and reliably. This conversion uses standard SI prefixes where each step is a factor of 1000, so the relationship is exact and unit-system consistent.",
      "This tool is intended for engineers, technicians, students, and anyone working with radio, audio, or instrumentation data who needs a clear conversion and practical guidance on precision, measurement limitations, and traceability to standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "SI prefixes define kilohertz and megahertz exactly: kilo = 10^3 and mega = 10^6. Converting kHz to MHz therefore uses the decimal factor between those prefixes.",
      "When converting a measured frequency, preserve the measurement’s significant figures and be mindful of the instrument’s resolution and calibration traceability. If the source value comes from an instrument, record the instrument model, resolution, and last calibration date for auditability.",
      "For critical measurements, follow calibration and uncertainty guidance from national metrology institutes and sector-specific regulators. For example, consult NIST and BIPM guidance on units and metrology for best practices."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 MHz = 1000 kHz (exact, by SI prefixes).",
      "Conversion formula (concise): MHz = kHz ÷ 1000.",
      "Practical step: take the numeric value in kilohertz, divide by 1000, and report the result with appropriate significant figures reflecting instrument resolution or measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1500 kHz → 1500 ÷ 1000 = 1.5 MHz",
      "500 kHz → 500 ÷ 1000 = 0.5 MHz",
      "0.25 kHz → 0.25 ÷ 1000 = 0.00025 MHz"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion between kHz and MHz exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. Because SI prefixes are decimal powers of ten, 1 MHz equals exactly 1000 kHz. The mathematical conversion is exact; any rounding comes from how you present significant figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I keep when converting?",
        "answer": "Match the precision to the original measurement and the instrument’s resolution. Preserve significant figures rather than arbitrarily adding decimals. For traceable measurements, include uncertainty from the instrument calibration in your reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What measurement limits should I consider when reporting frequency?",
        "answer": "Consider the instrument bandwidth, frequency resolution, sampling rate (for ADC-based systems), and last calibration. For digital sampling, ensure your sampling rate satisfies Nyquist criteria for the frequencies of interest and that anti-aliasing filters are applied as needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "If I have Hz instead of kHz, how do I convert to MHz?",
        "answer": "Use the chain of prefixes: 1 MHz = 10^6 Hz. So MHz = Hz ÷ 1,000,000. If starting from kHz, you can convert to MHz by dividing by 1000."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do regulatory band plans affect unit conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Band plans and allocations define how frequencies are used, not the unit relationships. However, when working with regulated wireless equipment, ensure reported frequencies and tolerances meet the regulator’s requirements (for example, the relevant communications authority) and that instruments are compliant and calibrated."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references for units and calibration?",
        "answer": "Consult national metrology institutes and international standards bodies for authoritative guidance on units and calibration traceability. These resources explain SI prefixes, unit definitions, and recommended practices for measurement uncertainty and calibration."
