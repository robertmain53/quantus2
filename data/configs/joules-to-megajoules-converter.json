    "introduction": [
      "Convert energy values from joules (J) to megajoules (MJ) quickly and accurately. This tool uses the SI prefix relationship where one megajoule equals one million joules, ensuring consistent, repeatable results for engineering, laboratory, and reporting workflows.",
      "The converter is designed for single-value inputs and outputs and includes guidance on significant figures, scientific notation for very large or small values, and practical notes on measurement traceability for regulated or calibrated environments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion follows SI prefix rules maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and applied in NIST guidance: 1 megajoule (MJ) = 10^6 joules (J). The tool performs an exact mathematical division by 1,000,000 and returns a numeric result that can be formatted as decimal or scientific notation.",
      "For lab or regulatory reporting, round results according to instrument resolution and required significant figures. When reporting values tied to calibration or compliance, ensure measurement traceability to a national metrology institute such as NIST or an equivalent national lab."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 MJ = 1,000,000 J (10^6 J).",
      "Conversion step: value_in_MJ = value_in_J / 1,000,000.",
      "Example: 5,000,000 J ÷ 1,000,000 = 5 MJ. Use scientific notation for very large/small inputs (e.g., 3.2e9 J = 3200 MJ)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Input: 1,000 J → Output: 0.001 MJ",
      "Input: 5,000,000 J → Output: 5 MJ",
      "Input: 3.2e9 J → Output: 3200 MJ"

    "summary": [
      "This converter performs an exact, SI-consistent division by 1,000,000 to convert joules to megajoules.",
      "For publication or regulatory use, round to the number of significant figures justified by the measurement instrument and maintain traceability to recognized standards."

      {
        "term": "Joule (J)",
        "definition": "SI unit of energy or work. One newton-meter."
      },
      {
        "term": "Megajoule (MJ)",
        "definition": "SI unit equal to 10^6 joules."

      {
        "term": "Traceability",
        "definition": "The property of a measurement result whereby it can be related to national or international standards through an unbroken chain of calibrations."

    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The unit relationship is exact by definition of SI prefixes: 1 MJ = 10^6 J. The numeric division is exact; any approximation arises only from rounding or display formatting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle significant figures and rounding?",
        "answer": "Match rounding to the resolution and uncertainty of your measurement instrument. If an energy value comes from a calibrated device with a stated uncertainty, report the converted value with the same number of significant figures or according to the combined uncertainty propagation rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I input values in scientific notation?",
        "answer": "Yes. Scientific notation (for example 3.2e6 for 3,200,000 J) preserves precision for very large or very small values and is recommended when dealing with extreme magnitudes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs only the unit conversion (J → MJ). For uncertainty analysis or calibration traceability, combine the converted numeric result with your instrument’s uncertainty budget and calibration certificate information."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or reporting considerations I should know?",
        "answer": "When converted energy values are used for regulatory reporting, audits, or safety calculations, follow the reporting and calibration requirements of the applicable authority (for example energy management standards or workplace safety regulations). Keep calibration certificates and reference standards traceable to a national metrology institute."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from MJ to J?",
        "answer": "Multiply the value in megajoules by 1,000,000 (value_in_J = value_in_MJ × 1,000,000)."
