    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct, fixed relationship conversion between milliliters (mL) and cubic centimeters (cm³). The relationship is exact within the defined unit system and requires only a single numeric input.",
      "The tool is intended for everyday, laboratory, and engineering workflows where users need a fast, authoritative conversion. For measurement work that requires documented traceability, follow calibration and uncertainty guidance described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) definitions: one milliliter equals one cubic centimeter. This is a unit identity derived from the relationship between liters and cubic centimeters under SI conventions.",
      "Although the mathematical conversion is exact, reported numeric precision should reflect instrument resolution, calibration status, and measurement uncertainty. For traceable results in regulated environments use accredited measurement labs and follow standards such as ISO/IEC 17025 and guidance from NIST.",
      "Practical considerations include instrument calibration, temperature dependence for volumetric glassware, and rounding rules appropriate to your reporting requirements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core identity: 1 mL = 1 cm³.",
      "To convert: multiply the value in milliliters by 1 to obtain the value in cubic centimeters. Example formula: volume_cm3 = volume_mL × 1.",
      "Round the result to an appropriate number of significant figures based on measurement uncertainty and instrument resolution."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "250 mL → 250 cm³",
      "0.5 mL → 0.5 cm³",
      "1000 mL → 1000 cm³ (which is equivalent to 1 liter)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion between mL and cm³ exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition in the SI system, 1 milliliter equals 1 cubic centimeter exactly. Any variation in reported values comes from measurement uncertainty, not the conversion itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report results with a number of significant figures consistent with the least precise measurement instrument and the estimated measurement uncertainty. For laboratory calibration and legal measurements follow documented uncertainty budgets and accreditation requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate my volumetric equipment?",
        "answer": "Yes. For accurate volumetric measurements use calibrated glassware or instruments. Calibration traceable to national standards is recommended for regulated or safety-critical work; see ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are temperature and fluid properties relevant to this conversion?",
        "answer": "The unit conversion is independent of temperature, but actual measured volumes of liquids can change with temperature and density. Account for thermal expansion when high accuracy of liquid volume is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small numbers?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical mapping is linear and valid at all scales, but consider numerical precision and formatting when working with extremely large or small values."
