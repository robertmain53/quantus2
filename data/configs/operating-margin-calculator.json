    "introduction": [
      "Operating margin measures how much profit a company makes from its core operations for each dollar of revenue. It is typically expressed as operating income (EBIT) divided by revenue, shown as a percentage.",
      "Use this calculator to convert operating income and revenue into an operating margin percentage and a ratio. The calculation follows common financial reporting practice used in investor disclosures and financial analysis.",
      "If you do not have an explicit operating income line, see the methodology and FAQs below for practical reconciliation steps from net income or component line items."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Definition and formula: Operating margin = (Operating income / Revenue) × 100. Operating income (also known as EBIT) is profit before interest and taxes but after operating expenses. For clarity, this calculator expects a numeric operating income value and total revenue.",
      "Data sources and reconciliation: If operating income is not reported, it can be reconciled from the income statement by starting with gross profit and subtracting operating expenses (selling, general and administrative expenses), and adding or subtracting other operating items. When using net income as the starting point, add back interest expense and tax expense and remove non‑operating gains and losses to approximate operating income, following guidance in financial reporting best practices.",
      "Benchmarks and comparability: Industry structure heavily influences operating margins. Compare margins only to peers in the same industry and the same accounting basis. For standardized financial statement definitions and filing practices, consult regulatory and standard‑setting guidance.",
      "Rounding and display: Results are shown both as a percent and as a ratio. Interpret small differences (e.g., ±0.5 percentage points) in the context of rounding, reporting period differences, and one‑time items."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is operating margin and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "Operating margin shows the proportion of revenue remaining after covering operating costs, excluding financing and tax effects. It indicates operational efficiency and is useful for comparing companies with similar business models."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I only have net income or gross profit?",
        "answer": "If you only have net income, approximate operating income by adding back interest and tax expense and removing non‑operating gains or losses. If you have gross profit, subtract operating expenses (selling, general & administrative, R&D if applicable) and add other operating income or subtract other operating losses. Always note adjustments and consult the original financial statements for one‑off items."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I compare operating margins across companies or industries?",
        "answer": "Compare margins to companies with similar revenue models, accounting policies, and scale. Capital intensity, gross margin structure, and business mix cause wide variation between industries. Use industry medians and long‑run averages rather than single quarter comparisons."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or accounting standards I should follow?",
        "answer": "Yes. Financial statement line items and presentation are governed by accounting standards and regulatory filing requirements. Consult the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for U.S. GAAP guidance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for disclosure expectations when using public company filings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common sources of error and how can I reduce them?",
        "answer": "Common errors include using mismatched periods, mixing consolidated and segment numbers, failing to remove non‑operating items, and currency mismatches. Reduce errors by confirming the reporting period, using consolidated statements consistently, reconciling the line items used to compute operating income, and ensuring all figures use the same currency and units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results and handle very small or very large numbers?",
        "answer": "Round percentages to one or two decimal places for readability. For very small revenues or negative values, interpret ratios with caution; small revenue denominators can produce volatile margin percentages. Always show the underlying operating income and revenue alongside the percentage."
