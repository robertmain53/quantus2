1. This is a simple_calc because operating margin is computed from multiple related inputs (operating income and revenue, with optional adjustments) producing one primary output (operating margin percentage).  

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".  

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].  

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.  

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, UI/layout/styling fields, and no form for converters).  

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

I scanned the provided input assets and will incorporate authoritative references and calibration cues from government and university sources. Related internal Cernarus pages I will reference in the config context (as slugs) include: /calculators/financial/margins, /guides/financial-metrics, /calculators/financial/ebitda.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
