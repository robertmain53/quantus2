    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts kilobits per second (kbps) to bits per second (bps) using standard SI (decimal) prefixes: 1 kilobit = 1,000 bits. It is intended for engineers, network technicians, and anyone comparing or converting nominal data rates.",
      "The tool highlights the common ambiguity between decimal (kilo = 10^3) and binary (kibi = 2^10) prefixes, explains rounding and reporting best practices, and provides authoritative references for measurement guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the SI definition of the kilo prefix (kilo = 10^3) for kilobits: therefore 1 kbps = 1,000 bps. This follows the metric/SI convention maintained by national metrology institutes.",
      "Where contexts use binary-counting conventions (common in some storage and legacy computing literature), the IEC binary prefix 'kibi' (Kibit) denotes 1,024 bits. This converter defaults to the SI (decimal) interpretation but documents the binary alternative for clarity and regulatory alignment."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Using SI (decimal) prefixes: bits per second = kilobits per second × 1,000",
      "If using IEC binary prefix (kibibit per second): bits per second = kibibits per second × 1,024",
      "Example formula shown to users: bps = kbps × 1000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 2.5 kbps to bps → 2.5 × 1,000 = 2,500 bps.",
      "Convert 150 kbps to bps → 150 × 1,000 = 150,000 bps.",
      "If a legacy source reports 1 Kibit/s (kibibit per second), that equals 1,024 bps (binary-prefix interpretation)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is 1 kilobit always 1,000 bits or 1,024 bits?",
        "answer": "By SI (metric) standards, 1 kilobit = 1,000 bits. The 1,024-bit value comes from binary prefixes; the IEC defines 'kibi' (Kibit) = 1,024. Use 'kbps' for decimal (1,000) and 'Kibit/s' or 'Kibibits per second' for binary (1,024) to avoid ambiguity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which convention do networking measurements and regulations use?",
        "answer": "Regulatory bodies and telecom reporting typically use decimal SI prefixes for data rates. For example, measurement programs and guidance documents emphasize decimal rates for advertised speeds and throughput reporting. When precise metrology is required, refer to national metrology institutes and the applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle rounding when converting?",
        "answer": "Round conversions according to the precision you need for reporting. For summary displays, 2–3 significant digits are common (e.g., 2.50 kbps → 2,500 bps). For engineering or billing contexts, preserve integer bit counts and document the rounding rule you applied."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for protocol overhead or measured throughput?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a pure unit conversion between kilobits and bits. Measured throughput can be lower than the nominal link rate due to protocol headers, retransmissions, and other overhead. For measurement best practices, consult standards and measurement guidance from authoritative agencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use kibibits (Kibit) instead of kilobits (kb)?",
        "answer": "Use kibibits when the quantity is defined in binary multiples (powers of 2), typically in low-level computing or memory contexts where quantities are inherently base-2. For network link speeds and telecom, kilobits (decimal) are generally correct."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are uppercase/lowercase letters important (kbps vs Kbps)?",
        "answer": "Yes. Case conveys units: 'b' for bit, 'B' for byte. 'kbps' is kilobits per second. Be consistent and document your notation when sharing results to avoid confusion between bits and bytes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative definitions for SI and binary prefixes?",
        "answer": "Authoritative definitions are published by national metrology institutes and international standards organizations that maintain SI and binary-prefix standards. See the citations below for primary sources."
