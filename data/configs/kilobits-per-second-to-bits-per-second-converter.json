To convert kilobits per second to bits per second, multiply by 1,000. For example, 1 kbps = 1,000 bps, 10 kbps = 10,000 bps.","Network speeds are specified at different scales depending on the context. Older modems used kbps, modern broadband uses Mbps or Gbps.","Understanding data rate units helps compare different network technologies and equipment specifications.","This converter provides precise data rate conversions for network analysis."],"examples":["Example 1 – Modem speed: A 56k modem transmits approximately 56,000 bps or 56 kbps.","Example 2 – VoIP quality: Adequate voice quality requires approximately 64 kbps or 64,000 bps.","Example 3 – Dial-up comparison: Early internet at 14.4 kbps = 14,400 bps was 1/1000th of modern broadband speeds."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from Kilobits per Second to Bits per Second?","answer":"1 kbps = 1,000 bps.

Using kbps, Mbps, and Gbps keeps numbers readable and comparable."},{"question":"Is kbps the same as kB/s?","answer":"No. kbps is kilobits per second (lowercase b). kB/s is kilobytes per second (capital B). 1 byte = 8 bits, so 1 kB/s = 8 kbps."}],"citations":[{"label":"IEEE – Data Transmission Standards","url":"https://www.ieee.org/"},{"label":"NIST – Network Speed Units","url":"https://www.nist.gov/"}],"glossary":[{"term":"Kilobit per Second (kbps)","definition":"Data rate of 1,000 bits transmitted per second."},{"term":"Bit per Second (bps)","definition":"Fundamental unit of data transmission rate."}]},"links":{"internal":["/conversions/data-rate/bits-per-second-to-kilobits-per-second-converter"],"external":[]},"schema":{"additionalTypes":["HowTo"]}}}
