1. This is a converter because MB/s ↔ Mbps is a fixed mathematical unit conversion with a single numeric input and single numeric output (no extra variables or methods required).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for this converter, no extra metadata keys like canonical_url/robots/keywords, no UI/layout fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

I scanned the provided asset corpus and will incorporate authoritative references to NIST, FCC, DOE, ISO, and leading universities in the citations and copy; I will also include relevant internal Cernarus slugs for related calculators and category hubs. Ready for me to produce the JSON?
