    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates kilobits per second (kbps) into megabytes per second (MB/s) using industry-standard unit definitions. Network throughput is commonly quoted in bits per second while file sizes and storage throughput are quoted in bytes per second, so conversions must account for the 8:1 bit-to-byte relationship and whether SI (decimal) or binary prefixes are intended.",
      "By default this tool uses SI (decimal) prefixes consistent with telecommunications and broadband reporting: 1 kilobit = 1,000 bits and 1 megabyte = 1,000,000 bytes. For environments that use binary prefixes (kibi, mebi) an alternate calculation is provided in the methodology and how_is_calculated sections."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Step 1 — Normalize units to base quantities: convert kilobits to bits (1 kb = 1,000 bits for SI; 1 Kib = 1,024 bits for binary).",
      "Step 2 — Convert bits to bytes by dividing by 8 because 1 byte = 8 bits.",
      "Step 3 — Convert bytes to megabytes using the chosen prefix convention: divide by 1,000,000 for SI megabytes (MB) or by 1,048,576 for mebibytes (MiB).",
      "This converter uses the SI path by default (common for network speed reporting). When binary prefixes are required for storage or certain system tools, use the binary formula shown below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal (SI) conversion, suitable for network speeds: MB/s = kbps / 8000. Example: 8,000 kbps → 8,000 / 8000 = 1 MB/s.",
      "Binary (kibi/mebi) conversion, for binary-prefixed systems: MiB/s = kibibits_per_second / 8192. Note kibibit = 1024 bits and mebibyte = 1024 * 1024 bytes, so factor = 8192.",
      "Quick mental checks: 1 Mbps = 0.125 MB/s (decimal). To get MB/s from kbps, divide by 8,000 (decimal) or 8,192 (binary)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 5,000 kbps (decimal): 5000 / 8000 = 0.625 MB/s.",
      "Convert 150,000 kbps (decimal): 150000 / 8000 = 18.75 MB/s.",
      "Binary-prefixed example: 8192 kibibits/s → 8192 / 8192 = 1 MiB/s."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do I divide by 8 when converting bits to bytes?",
        "answer": "A byte is defined as 8 bits. Converting a bit-rate to a byte-rate requires dividing by 8 so the unit changes from bits per second to bytes per second."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use /8000 vs /8192?",
        "answer": "Use /8000 when working with SI (decimal) prefixes, which is standard for internet service providers and many networking tools. Use /8192 when both the source and target units use binary prefixes (kibi/mebi), which shows up in some operating system and storage contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is kbps the same as KBps or kb/s the same as kB/s?",
        "answer": "No. Case matters: 'b' means bits and 'B' means bytes. 'kbps' typically means kilobits per second, while 'KB/s' means kilobytes per second. Always check the unit label before converting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does network overhead affect measured throughput?",
        "answer": "Protocol headers, acknowledgements, retransmissions, encryption, and link-layer framing consume part of the raw bit-rate. Advertised link speed is the physical layer maximum; effective payload throughput will typically be lower. For performance planning, account for protocol overhead and test with representative traffic."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standard definitions does this converter follow?",
        "answer": "This converter follows SI prefix definitions for decimal conversions and references the IEC/IEEE convention for binary prefixes. See the citations for official sources and standards documentation."
