    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a temperature value expressed on the Réaumur scale (°Ré) into the Kelvin scale (K). The Réaumur scale is a historical centigrade-derived scale still used occasionally in industry and historical data sets; Kelvin is the SI base unit for thermodynamic temperature.",
      "The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship and is appropriate for direct numeric translation. For metrology, laboratory work, and regulated reporting, follow instrument calibration and uncertainty guidance described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Réaumur is defined so that 0 °Ré corresponds to 0 °C and 80 °Ré corresponds to 100 °C. The conversion uses exact rational scaling between Réaumur and Celsius, and the internationally recognized offset from Celsius to Kelvin.",
      "This tool applies the direct algebraic conversion without applying measurement uncertainty or instrument-specific corrections. For regulated measurements consult NIST guidance on SI unit usage and relevant ISO standards on temperature measurement and calibration."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert Réaumur to Celsius: Celsius (°C) = Réaumur (°Ré) × 5/4.",
      "Step 2: Convert Celsius to Kelvin: Kelvin (K) = Celsius (°C) + 273.15.",
      "Combined formula: Kelvin (K) = (Réaumur × 5/4) + 273.15."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0 °Ré → (0 × 5/4) + 273.15 = 273.15 K",
      "80 °Ré → (80 × 5/4) + 273.15 = 373.15 K",
      "-10 °Ré → (-10 × 5/4) + 273.15 = 260.65 K"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship Kelvin = (Réaumur × 5/4) + 273.15 is exact for scale definition. Practical measurements include instrument uncertainty, which this converter does not model."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Report decimals consistent with measurement uncertainty and context. For laboratory reporting follow NIST and ISO guidance; for general use 2 decimal places is common (e.g., 273.15 K)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool handle negative Réaumur values?",
        "answer": "Yes. The linear formula applies to negative values as well. Ensure physical plausibility when converting extreme temperatures near absolute zero."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about calibration and regulatory compliance?",
        "answer": "Use calibrated sensors and maintain traceability to national standards. Follow NIST SP 811 for SI usage, ISO standards for thermometry and calibration procedures, IEEE standards for instrumentation where applicable, and OSHA rules for workplace temperature monitoring and safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter account for sensor nonlinearity or environmental effects?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a pure unit conversion. For sensor-specific corrections, compensation for radiative effects, or environmental corrections, apply instrument calibration curves or consult the sensor manufacturer and appropriate standards."
