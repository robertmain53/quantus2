    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts temperatures measured on the Réaumur scale (°Ré) into the Kelvin scale (K). The Réaumur scale is historical but still appears in legacy data and some scientific contexts; Kelvin is the SI base unit for thermodynamic temperature.",
      "The mathematical conversion is exact given a numeric Réaumur input. However, reported Kelvin values reflect only the arithmetic conversion; measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration, and rounding should be considered before using converted values for regulated work or precision science."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the fixed linear relationship between Réaumur and Celsius, and the exact offset between Celsius and Kelvin. No empirical calibration factors are required for the arithmetic conversion itself.",
      "For practical use, ensure the original Réaumur measurement has traceable calibration to a recognized standard and record measurement uncertainty as per ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance when the result will support compliance or safety decisions."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert Réaumur to Celsius using Celsius = Réaumur × 1.25.",
      "Step 2: Convert Celsius to Kelvin using Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15.",
      "Combined formula: Kelvin = (Réaumur × 1.25) + 273.15. Example algebraic form: K = Re × 5/4 + 273.15."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0 °Ré → 0 × 1.25 = 0 °C → 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 K",
      "80 °Ré → 80 × 1.25 = 100 °C → 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K",
      "-10 °Ré → -10 × 1.25 = -12.5 °C → -12.5 + 273.15 = 260.65 K"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the Réaumur-to-Kelvin conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes, the arithmetic conversion is an exact linear transformation (K = Re × 1.25 + 273.15). In practice, the overall accuracy depends on the precision and calibration of the instrument that produced the Réaumur reading and on rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Kelvin be negative after conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Kelvin is an absolute scale with 0 K as absolute zero. A converted result cannot be below 0 K. If a Réaumur input would algebraically produce a value below 0 K, it indicates a measurement error or nonphysical input."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "Report the converted value with no more precision than justified by the original measurement and its uncertainty. Use uncertainty reporting standards from ISO/IEC 17025 and NIST guidance when reporting for calibration, regulatory, or scientific purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need instrument calibration before converting?",
        "answer": "For any measurement used in compliance, safety, or research, ensure instruments are calibrated with traceability to national standards. Calibration practices should follow ISO/IEC 17025 and relevant industry standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standards apply to temperature measurement and reporting?",
        "answer": "Commonly cited references include the NIST Guide to the SI and measurement practice, the BIPM SI Brochure, ISO/IEC 17025 for laboratory competence and calibration traceability, and relevant OSHA guidance for occupational temperature control. Consult domain-specific standards for sensor types and environments."
