1. This is a converter because the user is converting a single quantity (cups of a specific ingredient) into a single target unit (grams) — one input produces one output and the interface is a straightforward unit conversion.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" because this matches a single-value unit conversion workflow.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, open_graph, form for converters, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
