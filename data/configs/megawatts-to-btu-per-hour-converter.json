    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a power value in megawatts (MW) into British thermal units per hour (Btu/h). The relationship is fixed and based on the watt-to-Btu/h factor; no additional inputs are required.",
      "Use this tool for engineering estimates, energy billing conversions, and systems sizing. For regulatory reporting, check applicable local standards and instrument calibration records to ensure traceability and compliance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses SI and accepted thermal unit definitions: 1 megawatt (MW) = 1,000,000 watts (W), and 1 watt = 3.412141633 Btu/h (International Table definition commonly used in engineering practice). The calculation multiplies MW by these factors to yield Btu/h.",
      "When high accuracy is required, consider which BTU definition your application or jurisdiction uses (for example, International Table BTU versus thermochemical BTU) and account for instrument uncertainty and calibration. Follow guidance from NIST and ISO on unit definitions and uncertainty, and consult IEEE/OSHA guidance for measurement and safety practices where relevant."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert megawatts to watts: watts = MW × 1,000,000.",
      "Step 2: Convert watts to Btu per hour using the factor 1 W = 3.412141633 Btu/h (International Table).",
      "Compact formula: Btu/h = MW × 1,000,000 × 3.412141633 = MW × 3,412,141.633."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 MW → 1 × 3,412,141.633 = 3,412,141.633 Btu/h.",
      "Example 2: 0.5 MW → 0.5 × 3,412,141.633 = 1,706,070.8165 Btu/h (report per required rounding).",
      "Example 3: 10 MW → 10 × 3,412,141.633 = 34,121,416.33 Btu/h."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which BTU definition does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the International Table BTU definition embedded in the common engineering factor 1 W = 3.412141633 Btu/h. If your workflow requires a different BTU variant, adjust the factor accordingly and note the difference in documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits are appropriate?",
        "answer": "Choose significant digits based on measurement uncertainty. For raw unit conversion, reporting 6 to 9 significant figures is mathematically possible, but for measured inputs use the same precision as your instrument calibration certificate and follow NIST/ISO guidance on uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter suitable for regulatory or safety submissions?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship and is suitable for calculations. For regulatory submissions, also include instrument calibration records, uncertainty analysis, and cite the standard definitions used (for example, NIST or ISO documents). Consult relevant regulatory bodies for formatting and traceability requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from Btu/h to MW?",
        "answer": "Invert the factor: MW = Btu/h ÷ 3,412,141.633. Ensure you use the same BTU definition when reversing the conversion."
