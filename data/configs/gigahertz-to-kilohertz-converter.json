    "introduction": [
      "Convert values expressed in gigahertz (GHz) to kilohertz (kHz) using the SI prefix relationship between giga (10^9) and kilo (10^3). This converter applies the fixed metric scaling between units for instant, lossless unit conversion.",
      "The conversion is exact within the arithmetic precision you choose: 1 GHz equals 1,000,000 kHz (10^6). Use this tool for specification checks, signal-processing calculations, documentation, and instrumentation readouts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "SI prefixes define the relationship: giga (G) = 10^9 and kilo (k) = 10^3. Convert via a common base unit (hertz): multiply the GHz value by 10^9 to get hertz, then divide by 10^3 to get kilohertz, giving an overall factor of 10^6.",
      "This converter applies that fixed scaling factor; no approximation or empirical coefficient is used. For display, round results to the number of significant figures required by your application — engineering datasheets often quote 3–6 significant figures depending on tolerance.",
      "When using converted values in measurements or regulatory filings, verify instrument calibration and traceability. Laboratory-grade frequency measurements should be traceable to national standards (for example, NIST time and frequency references). Check local regulatory bodies for spectrum allocation and reporting requirements."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with value in gigahertz (GHz).",
      "Step 2: Multiply by 1,000,000 (10^6) to convert to kilohertz (kHz): kHz = GHz × 1,000,000.",
      "Equivalent formulation using hertz: kHz = (GHz × 10^9) / 10^3 = GHz × 10^6."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.002 GHz → 0.002 × 1,000,000 = 2,000 kHz",
      "2.45 GHz → 2.45 × 1,000,000 = 2,450,000 kHz",
      "0.001 GHz (1 MHz) → 1,000 kHz",
      "3.5 GHz → 3,500,000 kHz"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between GHz and kHz?",
        "answer": "1 gigahertz (1 GHz) equals 1,000,000 kilohertz (1,000,000 kHz). The relationship follows SI prefixes: Giga = 10^9, kilo = 10^3, so the conversion factor is 10^(9-3) = 10^6."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round after conversion?",
        "answer": "Round to the number of significant figures required by your use case. Technical datasheets often use 3–6 significant figures. For high-precision metrology, follow your lab's uncertainty analysis and report measurement uncertainty alongside the converted value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about instrument calibration when reporting converted frequencies?",
        "answer": "Yes. Conversion itself is exact mathematically, but reported measurement values depend on instrument accuracy and calibration. For traceability and regulatory compliance, use instruments calibrated to national standards (for example, NIST traceable frequency standards) and document uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion affected by environmental conditions?",
        "answer": "No — unit conversion is purely arithmetic. However, the measured frequency from hardware can shift with temperature, power, or aging; account for those effects in measurement uncertainty, not in the arithmetic conversion between units."
      },
      {
        "question": "When would I use GHz versus kHz?",
        "answer": "Use GHz for radio and microwave system specifications (wireless bands, radar, GHz-range oscillators). Use kHz for lower-frequency signals (audio ranges, some instrumentation) or when tooling and datasets are normalized to kilohertz for readability. Choose the unit that keeps numeric values manageable and consistent with documentation practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references for unit definitions and best practice?",
        "answer": "Refer to metric/SI references and national metrology institutes for definitions and calibration guidance. National authorities and standards organizations publish SI unit definitions, frequency metrology resources, and spectrum regulation guidance."
