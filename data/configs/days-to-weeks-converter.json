    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a quantity expressed in days into the equivalent number of weeks using the fixed relationship 1 week = 7 days. It supports exact fractional results as well as common rounding modes (e.g., round to 2 decimals, floor to whole weeks, or show full weeks plus leftover days).",
      "Use this tool for calendar planning, project timelines, reporting durations, or quick mental checks. It does not attempt to interpret calendar-specific constructs such as ISO week numbers, business-week definitions, or daylight-saving transitions; those are addressed in the methodology and glossary."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is performed with the fixed mathematical ratio weeks = days ÷ 7. This is a deterministic arithmetic transformation and does not require external reference data.",
      "When presenting results, users may choose different representations: a decimal number of weeks, an integer count of full weeks plus remaining days, or a rounded value to a chosen precision. We recommend explicitly stating the rounding rule used when reporting durations.",
      "Standards and authoritative sources guide time representation and reporting. For week numbering and calendar semantics consult ISO 8601; for high-precision timekeeping and calibration practices consult NIST guidance. Occupational definitions of a workweek may differ from a calendar week; consult relevant workplace regulations (for example, OSHA) when converting for compliance or payroll."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: weeks = days / 7",
      "Full weeks and remainder: full_weeks = floor(days / 7); remaining_days = days - (full_weeks * 7)",
      "Rounding examples: rounded_weeks = round(days / 7, n) where n is the number of decimal places requested; truncated_weeks = floor((days / 7) * 10^n) / 10^n for truncation",
      "Precision and display: present both the exact fractional value and the chosen rounded representation so recipients can assess rounding impact"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "10 days → 10 ÷ 7 = 1.428571... weeks. Display as 1.4286 weeks (rounded to 4 decimals) or 1 week and 3 days (full weeks plus remainder).",
      "14 days → 14 ÷ 7 = 2 weeks exactly.",
      "30 days → 30 ÷ 7 = 4.285714... weeks. Rounded to 2 decimals = 4.29 weeks; as full weeks plus days = 4 weeks and 2 days."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for calendar week numbering (ISO weeks)?",
        "answer": "No. This converter uses the pure arithmetic ratio 1 week = 7 days. ISO week numbering (ISO 8601) defines which calendar week a date belongs to and can shift week numbers across years; that is a separate calendar operation not performed here."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I report partial weeks for payroll or compliance?",
        "answer": "For payroll or regulatory reporting, follow the rounding and aggregation rules specified by the applicable authority or employer policy. This tool provides the numeric conversion; do not assume it meets legal or payroll rules without verifying local regulations and employer policies (consult OSHA or your payroll provider if needed)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding options are recommended?",
        "answer": "Display both the exact fractional result and a rounded value. Common practice is 2 decimal places for general reporting and 4+ decimals for scientific or planning use. For counts of weeks used in scheduling, prefer an integer count of full weeks plus leftover days to avoid ambiguity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are leap seconds or daylight saving time adjustments relevant?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds and daylight saving time affect clock time measurements, not the calendrical day-to-week arithmetic used here. This conversion treats a day as the calendar day unit and a week as seven such days."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert workdays to weeks with this tool?",
        "answer": "Not directly. A 'workweek' or 'business week' may contain 5 workdays, 6, or other definitions. To convert workdays to calendar weeks first map workdays to calendar days (for example, 5 workdays = 1 standard business week) then use the appropriate ratio; document the mapping used."
