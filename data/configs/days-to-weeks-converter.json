      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms time measurements from days to weeks, enabling project planning across different timeframes.",
        "Project management and scheduling often require converting between daily and weekly durations.",
        "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 week equals exactly 7 days."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 week = 7 days. To convert days to weeks, divide by 7. For example, 7 days = 1 week, 14 days = 2 weeks.",
        "Weekly planning is standard for project management, while daily tracking provides detailed progress metrics.",
        "Understanding day-to-week conversion is essential for project timeline estimation and scheduling.",
        "This converter provides precise time duration conversion for professional planning."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Short project: 7 days = 1 week.",
        "Example 2 – Monthly sprint: 28 days = 4 weeks.",
        "Example 3 – Extended timeline: 90 days = approximately 12.9 weeks."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How many days are in a week?",
          "answer": "1 week = 7 days (Monday through Sunday)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why use weeks for planning?",
          "answer": "Weeks align with natural work cycles and are easier to manage than individual days."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I calculate weeks from days?",
          "answer": "Divide the number of days by 7. Example: 28 days ÷ 7 = 4 weeks."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's a sprint in project management?",
          "answer": "A sprint is typically a 1-4 week period of focused work on specific project goals."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I calculate project duration in weeks?",
          "answer": "Estimate daily tasks, sum to total days, then divide by 7 to get weeks needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "What about partial weeks?",
          "answer": "Use decimal weeks: 10 days = 1.43 weeks (10 ÷ 7)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do weeks relate to months?",
          "answer": "Approximately 4.3 weeks per month, but months vary in days (28-31)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are weekends included in project weeks?",
          "answer": "It depends on project context. Business weeks (5 days) vs. calendar weeks (7 days)."
