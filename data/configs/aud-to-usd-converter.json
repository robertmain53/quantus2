    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts amounts from Australian dollars (AUD) to United States dollars (USD) using current interbank-style exchange rates. Results show the direct conversion value; final amounts from banks or payment providers may differ because of spreads, fees, or rounding.",
      "Use this tool for quick reference, budgeting, invoicing, or checks before making an international payment. For regulated, high-value transfers, confirm the rate, fees, and timestamp with your chosen provider immediately prior to the transaction.",
      "Exchange rates update frequently during market hours and reflect available market liquidity at the quoted time. Where possible consult official central bank or government sources for policy context and historical exchange data."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter displays conversions by multiplying the amount in AUD by a current FX rate that represents a market mid-point (interbank) or a published spot rate. It does not apply provider-specific fees or markups.",
      "Rates are obtained from aggregated market data sources and aligned with conventions used by central banks and financial authorities. For regulatory and trading context see Reserve Bank of Australia and the Federal Reserve guidance linked below.",
      "Displayed values are calculated in decimal arithmetic and rounded for display. For settlement or accounting, use the raw unrounded rate and record the exact timestamp and source of the quote."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Obtain the current AUD→USD spot rate (expressed as USD per 1 AUD) from market data.",
      "Step 2: Multiply: USD amount = AUD amount × spot rate. Example formula: USD = AUD × rate.",
      "Note: Bid/ask spreads mean providers will often use a dealer buy or sell rate rather than the mid-market rate. Provider final = (AUD × spot rate) ± provider markup − fees.",
      "Timestamps: include timezone (UTC) and seconds when recording quotes. For audits, store source, timestamp, and raw rate."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100.00 AUD at rate 0.6500 → 100.00 × 0.6500 = 65.00 USD.",
      "Example 2: 1,234.56 AUD at rate 0.7043 → 1,234.56 × 0.7043 = 869.72 USD (rounding applied to 2 decimal places)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where do the exchange rates come from?",
        "answer": "Rates are aggregated from interbank market data and public central bank publications. For methodology and market context consult central bank publications and international financial authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is the rate on this page different from my bank or card issuer?",
        "answer": "Banks and card issuers apply their own bid/ask spreads, markups, and fees. This converter shows a market-style spot rate; your provider may add a percentage or fixed fee and use a different timestamp."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool include fees or taxes?",
        "answer": "No. This tool shows the currency conversion only. Fees, taxes, payment routing charges, and receiving bank fees are not included and must be checked separately with your provider."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often are rates updated and what timestamp should I use for records?",
        "answer": "Rates update frequently during FX market hours. For record-keeping use the full UTC timestamp (date and time) of the quote and the data source. For critical transfers, obtain a live quote immediately before sending funds."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the mid-market rate versus bid and ask?",
        "answer": "The mid-market rate is the midpoint between dealer bid and ask prices and is commonly used as a neutral reference. Dealers transact at bid (buy) or ask (sell) prices, which include spreads and may differ from the mid-market."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use for accounting?",
        "answer": "For most retail and accounting purposes round converted USD to two decimal places (cents). For large transfers or reconciliation keep at least six significant figures in internal records and store the raw rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this tool for regulatory reporting or tax filings?",
        "answer": "Use this tool for initial estimates. For regulatory reporting or tax filings, use the rate and methodology required by the relevant authority and document the source. Check government guidance or your accountant for jurisdiction-specific rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might the conversion change between viewing and settlement?",
        "answer": "FX rates fluctuate continuously. Differences arise from market movement, execution delay, provider markups, liquidity changes, and processing times. Lock in a rate with your provider for guaranteed settlement pricing."
