    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns any megabyte (MB) value into gigabytes (GB) using the metric base-10 relationship that device makers and cloud dashboards commonly follow.",
      "Because 1 gigabyte equals 1,000 megabytes in the SI decimal system, the calculation is a simple division by 1,000. Use this to reconcile storage specs, transfer estimates, and billing breakpoints."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Apply the decimal SI definition: 1 GB = 1,000 MB. The converter divides the MB input by 1,000 to return GB.",
      "If a context expects binary units (GiB), adjust with 1 GiB = 1,024 MiB = 1,048,576 KiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes; decimal remains the default shown here."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "GB = MB ÷ 1,000 (decimal SI convention).",
      "For binary contexts (GiB), convert MB to bytes (MB × 1,000,000) then divide by 1,073,741,824 to get GiB."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 MB → 0.5 GB",
      "1,000 MB → 1 GB",
      "2,500 MB → 2.5 GB"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do some tools use 1,024 instead of 1,000?",
        "answer": "Operating systems that show GiB (gibibytes) use powers of two, so 1 GiB = 1,024 MiB. Hardware marketing, ISP plans, and most cloud dashboards use decimal SI (1 GB = 1,000 MB)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle MB listed as MiB?",
        "answer": "If the source uses MiB, first convert MiB → bytes (MiB × 1,048,576) and then bytes → GB (bytes ÷ 1,000,000,000)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for filesystem or protocol overhead?",
        "answer": "No. This is a pure unit conversion. Real storage availability and transfer throughput can be slightly lower once overhead is considered."
