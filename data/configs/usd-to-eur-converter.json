    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a USD amount into EUR using a supplied exchange rate and accounts for optional percentage and fixed fees. It is designed for transparency: you provide the rate and fee terms you saw from a provider, and the tool shows gross conversion, fees, and the net amount you would receive.",
      "Exchange rates fluctuate continuously. For authoritative reference rates and schedules consult central bank or government publications; for ISO currency codes and standards see ISO 4217. Use this tool to compute outcomes from a quoted rate — always verify with your bank or payment provider before transacting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We perform direct arithmetic using the user-provided exchange rate (EUR per USD). Gross conversion equals USD amount multiplied by the rate.",
      "Fees are modeled as a percentage of the converted gross amount plus an optional fixed fee in EUR. Net amount subtracts total fees from the gross converted EUR value.",
      "The effective net rate is computed as net EUR divided by the original USD amount (a small epsilon is added to the denominator in the calculation logic to avoid division-by-zero errors when USD amount is zero)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Converted (gross) = amount × rate",
      "Total fee = (amount × rate) × (fee_percent / 100) + fixed_fee",
      "Converted (net) = Converted (gross) − Total fee",
      "Effective net rate = Converted (net) ÷ amount (reported as EUR per USD)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Where should I get the exchange rate I enter?",
        "answer": "Use the exact rate quoted by the provider you plan to use. Public reference rates published by central banks (for example, the European Central Bank) reflect mid-market or reference levels and may differ from provider rates, which commonly include markup."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between mid-market and provider rates?",
        "answer": "Mid-market (or interbank) rates represent the midpoint between buy and sell prices in the wholesale FX market. Retail providers (banks, money-transfer services) typically add a spread or fees; include those in this calculator as a fee percentage or fixed fee to see the net outcome."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool fetch live market data?",
        "answer": "No. For auditability and repeatable results this calculator uses the rate you enter. To use live published reference rates, look up the current rates on official central bank releases and paste the quoted number here before calculating."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is there a small epsilon in the effective rate calculation?",
        "answer": "A tiny value is added to the denominator when computing the effective rate to prevent division-by-zero errors when the USD amount is zero; it does not affect results for normal positive amounts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are taxes or regulatory charges included?",
        "answer": "This calculator does not model taxes, VAT, or regulatory levies unless you include them as part of the fixed_fee or fee_percent inputs. Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction — consult your tax authority or a qualified advisor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are results for large amounts?",
        "answer": "Arithmetic is exact to the precision of the input values. For very large transfers, providers may apply tiered pricing, rate guarantees, or counterparty limits; confirm terms with the provider and model those as appropriate fees in the inputs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use ISO currency codes here?",
        "answer": "Yes. This calculator assumes USD (United States dollar) converted into EUR (Euro) as per ISO 4217 conventions. For other currencies, use the corresponding currency code and the appropriate exchange rate."
