    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes gross profit and gross margin using standard accounting definitions: gross profit equals total revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue.",
      "Use the fields to enter your period revenue and the matching COGS in the same currency. The tool returns gross profit (currency), gross margin as a percentage, and gross margin as a decimal ratio. Review the accuracy notes before using results for reporting or pricing decisions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Gross profit is computed as total_revenue - cogs. Gross margin (%) is (gross profit / total_revenue) × 100. The calculator applies straightforward arithmetic and does not attempt to reclassify account items; inputs must reflect consistent accounting treatment.",
      "For data integrity and traceability, follow documented accounting policies (for example GAAP or IFRS) when selecting what counts as revenue and COGS. Numerical handling follows industry guidance on numeric precision and floating-point stability as described by IEEE standards; audit trails and source ledger reconciliation are recommended per ISO quality-management practices and NIST data integrity guidelines."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS",
      "Step 2: Gross Margin (decimal) = Gross Profit / Total Revenue",
      "Step 3: Gross Margin (%) = Gross Margin (decimal) × 100",
      "If Total Revenue is zero, the margin ratio and percent are undefined; review inputs and use caution with very small revenue values to avoid misleading percentages."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Total Revenue = 100000, COGS = 60000 → Gross Profit = 40000; Gross Margin = 40.00%",
      "Example 2: Total Revenue = 25000, COGS = 20000 → Gross Profit = 5000; Gross Margin = 20.00%",
      "Example 3: Total Revenue = 0, COGS = 0 → Gross Profit = 0; Gross Margin is undefined. Use this tool only when revenue is positive or interpret the ratio with caution."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This calculator provides quick, auditable gross profit and gross margin calculations from two inputs. It is intended for planning, pricing checks, and simple reporting but not as a substitute for formal financial statements or audit procedures.",
      "Always reconcile inputs against the accounting ledger and consider currency conversions and period alignment before reporting results."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What definitions of revenue and COGS should I use?",
        "answer": "Use the definitions from your accounting policy or applicable reporting framework (for example GAAP or IFRS). Ensure revenue and COGS are measured over the same period and in the same currency before entering values."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle zero or negative revenue?",
        "answer": "If total revenue is zero, margin percentage and ratio are undefined. Negative revenues or negative COGS can produce results that are mathematically correct but may require specialist interpretation; consult your accountant for unusual cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "The calculator performs basic arithmetic with typical floating-point precision. For regulatory reporting or audit evidence, reconcile with source systems and follow numeric precision and traceability controls recommended by IEEE and NIST. Rounding can affect displayed percent values; use ledger-level data for final reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for pricing or tax calculations?",
        "answer": "This tool is intended for quick analysis and should not replace formal pricing models, tax advice, or audited financial statements. For tax or regulatory reporting, follow relevant laws and standards and consult a qualified professional."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is there a currency selector?",
        "answer": "The currency selector controls display labelling only. The tool does not perform currency conversion. Enter values already converted to the same currency for correct results."
