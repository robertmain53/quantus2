    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a volume given in liters into US dry pecks (peck, US dry). The peck is a traditional US dry volume unit equal to one quarter of a US dry bushel.",
      "Results use the standardized conversion between US customary dry units and metric units. See the methodology and citations for exact definitions, recommended display precision, and regulatory guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies a fixed, exact mathematical conversion between metric and US dry customary units. For unit definitions and authoritative references we follow standards documented by national and international bodies.",
      "This converter distinguishes US dry pecks from liquid or imperial measures. It does not attempt to account for material bulk density, container fill factor, or temperature-dependent liquid expansion; those are separate measurement considerations and require additional inputs."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition used: 1 US dry peck = 1/4 US dry bushel. The US dry bushel is defined as exactly 2150.42 cubic inches, which equals 35.23907016688 liters. Therefore 1 peck (US dry) = 35.23907016688 / 4 = 8.80976754172 liters.",
      "Conversion formulas: pecks = liters / 8.80976754172; alternatively pecks = liters * 0.113376420 (factor rounded to 9 significant digits for clarity).",
      "Recommended display: default results rounded to 3 decimal places for typical consumer or kitchen use; increase precision for scientific or legal purposes and note rounding in reports. All conversions are mathematical; measurement error comes from the input measurement device and sampling method."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 liter → 0.113 peck (US dry) approximately",
      "10 liters → 1.134 pecks (US dry) approximately",
      "35.23907016688 liters → 4.000 pecks (US dry) exactly (equivalent to 1 US dry bushel)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is a peck the same for liquids and dry goods?",
        "answer": "No. The peck used here is the US dry peck. Liquid quarts, gallons, and related liquid units differ in volume from their dry counterparts. Always use the US dry peck when converting dry-volume commodities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does temperature or material density affect the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between liters and pecks is fixed and does not change with temperature. However, the measured volume of some materials (especially liquids) can change with temperature, and bulk materials (grains, powders) have packing and bulk density effects that affect mass-to-volume conversions; those require separate inputs and calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the number shown?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion uses the exact unit definitions referenced in standards. Displayed precision is subject to rounding. Measurement uncertainty is determined by the instrument and sampling; consult measurement standards for calibration and uncertainty evaluation."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use greater precision than three decimals?",
        "answer": "Use higher precision for laboratory, regulatory, or commercial transactions where small differences matter. Document the number of significant figures and the measurement uncertainty when reporting results for compliance or contracts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert a mass of grain to pecks using this tool?",
        "answer": "Not directly. Converting mass to volume requires knowing the bulk density or bushel weight of the commodity. Use a calculator that accepts bulk density or standard bushel weight to convert mass to pecks."
