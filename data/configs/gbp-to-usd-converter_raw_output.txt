1. This is a simple_calc because currency conversion requires a variable market exchange rate (and optional fees/margins); users provide amount and rate (and optional fee inputs) to compute a single USD output.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url) and no HTML tags.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, form for converters, etc.). The config will include only allowed keys for simple_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
