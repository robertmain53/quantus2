    "introduction": [
      "Convert angle measures from radians to gradians (also called grads or gon). A grad divides a full circle into 400 equal parts and is commonly used in surveying and some engineering fields.",
      "This converter uses the exact mathematical equivalence between radians and gradians: a full turn is 2π radians = 400 grads, so conversions use the factor 200/π for radians→grads and π/200 for grads→radians."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is derived from the definition of a full circle. One full circle equals 2π radians and 400 gradians, therefore 1 radian = 400 / (2π) = 200 / π gradians. This relationship is exact and independent of measurement system conventions.",
      "For engineering and laboratory work, apply appropriate numeric precision for your instrument or dataset. Use double-precision arithmetic for programmatic conversions to preserve accuracy; round final displayed results to the number of significant digits required by your application or measurement tolerance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Radians to gradians: grads = radians × (200 / π). Example: 1 rad × (200 / π) ≈ 63.6619772368 grads.",
      "Gradians to radians: radians = grads × (π / 200). Example: 100 grads × (π / 200) = π/2 ≈ 1.5707963268 rad.",
      "When working with measured angles, account for instrument resolution and calibration. Conversions are exact mathematically; any measurement uncertainty comes from the original reading."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.5 rad → 0.5 × (200 / π) ≈ 31.8309886 grads",
      "2 radians → 2 × (200 / π) ≈ 127.3239545 grads",
      "50 grads → 50 × (π / 200) ≈ 0.785398163 rad (π/4)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between radians and gradians?",
        "answer": "1 radian = 200 / π gradians (exact). Numerically 1 rad ≈ 63.6619772368 grads. Conversely, 1 grad = π / 200 radians."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why would I use gradians instead of degrees or radians?",
        "answer": "Gradians divide a circle into 400 units, which can simplify decimal-based surveying calculations and certain civil engineering tasks. Choice of unit is convention-driven; most scientific computing and calculus use radians for their direct relation to arc length and trigonometric derivatives."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle rounding and precision for lab or field measurements?",
        "answer": "Perform conversions using double-precision arithmetic and round only for display or reporting. Match rounding to your instrument's resolution and the required tolerance (for example, arc-second precision for high-accuracy surveying). Document uncertainty propagation from the original measurement through the conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about angle wrap-around (values outside 0–400 grads or 0–2π radians)?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion works for any real-valued angle. For normalized bearings or cyclic quantities, reduce the converted result modulo 400 grads (or modulo 2π radians) to produce an equivalent principal value in the desired range."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these conversions consistent with national and international standards?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversions use the standard definitions of angle units (full circle = 2π radians). For authoritative guidance on units and SI usage consult standards and references such as NIST publications and ISO standards."
