    "introduction": [
      "Use this meters to feet converter when project-critical specifications demand international-foot accuracy backed by NIST definitions.",
      "We automate the exact 1 meter to 3.280839895 feet relationship while flagging U.S. survey foot pitfalls so surveyors, architects, and trades stay aligned.",
      "Regulatory context and worked examples help teams move cleanly between metric drawings and imperial site work without loss of precision."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The engine multiplies every meter input by 3.280839895, the reciprocal of the exactly defined 0.3048 meter international foot from the International Yard and Pound Agreement.",
      "We surface the 2023 NIST directive to default to the international foot and explain that the legacy U.S. survey foot (1200/3937 meters) can skew large coordinate values by about two parts per million.",
      "Outputs retain six decimal places so results stay inside ISO 80000-3 tolerances while still allowing quick rounding guidance for field crews."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Commercial door header: 2.1 meters converts to 6.88976 feet, keeping architectural schedules synchronized with imperial framing hardware.",
      "Survey control baseline: 137.16 meters equals exactly 450.00000 feet, so CAD exports match state plane coordinates at staking time.",
      "Manufacturing jig adjustment: 0.762 meters translates to 2.50000 feet, letting machinists program legacy tooling without rounding error."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What conversion factor does this calculator use?",
        "answer": "We multiply by 3.280839895 feet per meter, the internationally sanctioned constant derived from the exact 0.3048 meter definition of the foot."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the tool handle the retired U.S. survey foot?",
        "answer": "We flag when data sets still expect the 1200/3937 meter survey foot so users can avoid the two-part-per-million discrepancy NIST warns about and document the adjustment for stakeholders."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much precision do I need to keep?",
        "answer": "The calculator returns six decimal places to preserve millimeter-level fidelity; you can round to two decimals for everyday use once you confirm tolerances in project specs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do these standards come from?",
        "answer": "The methodology is anchored to the International Yard and Pound Agreement, NIST Special Publications, and municipal survey guidance so engineering, construction, and GIS teams stay audit-ready."
