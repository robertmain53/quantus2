    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single numeric value expressed in seconds into the equivalent number of weeks using the fixed International System (SI) second and the conventional definition of a week (7 days). The tool is intended for everyday calculations, scheduling estimates, engineering unit conversions, and documentation.",
      "Results use the exact arithmetic relationship 1 week = 7 days = 7 × 24 hours = 7 × 24 × 60 minutes = 7 × 24 × 60 × 60 seconds = 604800 seconds. Where legal, scientific, or compliance precision is required, review the accuracy caveats below about leap seconds and time standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the fixed mathematical relationship between base SI seconds and calendar weeks. The converter treats the second as the SI base unit and a week as a block of 7 consecutive 24-hour days, totaling 604800 SI seconds.",
      "This conversion is purely mathematical and deterministic. It does not attempt to account for civil-time adjustments (such as leap seconds) that are applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for synchronization purposes.",
      "For timekeeping, synchronization, or legal timestamps where UTC behavior matters, consult the relevant standards cited below and any organizational policies on timestamping and time synchronization."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: weeks = seconds ÷ 604800",
      "Inverse (to get seconds back): seconds = weeks × 604800",
      "Notes: Use appropriate numeric precision and rounding for your context. This conversion treats each second equally and does not model insertion/removal of leap seconds."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Input: 604800 seconds → Output: 1 week",
      "Input: 1209600 seconds → Output: 2 weeks",
      "Input: 864000 seconds → Output: 1.4285714286 weeks (864000 ÷ 604800 ≈ 1.4285714286)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the result exact?",
        "answer": "Mathematically, using the defined relationship 1 week = 604800 seconds, the arithmetic result is exact for integer multiples of 604800 seconds. For non-integer results the decimal representation may be rounded for display; internal calculations should retain sufficient precision for your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds affect this conversion?",
        "answer": "No. Leap seconds are occasional one-second adjustments applied to UTC and are not reflected in this pure unit conversion. If you need to convert civil time spans that include leap-second insertions or removals, use time-series aware tools and reference UTC historical records."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about negative or very large values?",
        "answer": "Negative values are allowed and represent durations in the opposite direction. Very large values should be handled with attention to numeric limits in your environment; use arbitrary-precision or 64-bit floating arithmetic as appropriate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Rounding depends on context. For display to users, choose a sensible number of decimal places (for example, 2–6) and document the precision. For engineering or billing calculations, follow your organization or regulatory rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for legal or safety compliance?",
        "answer": "This converter provides a mathematical unit conversion only. For legal, regulatory, or safety-critical contexts, confirm with your organization's compliance officers and refer to the specific standards and regulations that apply to your domain."
