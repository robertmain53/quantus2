    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a fixed mathematical conversion between liters and cubic centimeters. The relationship is part of the International System of Units and is exact at the unit-definition level.",
      "Use this tool for quick, reliable unit translations in lab calculations, engineering notes, documentation, and everyday measurements. Where measurements are taken from instruments, account for instrument calibration and measurement uncertainty when reporting results."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "A liter is defined as one cubic decimeter. Because one decimeter equals 10 centimeters, one liter equals 10 × 10 × 10 cubic centimeters; therefore the conversion factor is exact by definition.",
      "Although the unit conversion factor is exact, real-world volume values come from measurements that have uncertainty. Follow measurement best practices, report significant figures consistently, and use calibrated equipment for applications subject to regulation or safety requirements.",
      "Standards and guidance referenced include national and international metrology and measurement documents. For legal metrology or occupational limits consult the relevant regulatory body and apply measurement uncertainty guidance from recognized standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core formula: 1 L = 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³.",
      "To convert liters to cubic centimeters: multiply the value in liters by 1000 (cm³ = L × 1000).",
      "To convert cubic centimeters to liters: divide the value in cubic centimeters by 1000 (L = cm³ ÷ 1000)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 2.5 L × 1000 = 2500 cm³.",
      "Example 2: 0.003 L × 1000 = 3 cm³.",
      "Example 3: 1250 cm³ ÷ 1000 = 1.25 L."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition in the SI system, 1 liter equals 1000 cubic centimeters exactly. Any non-exactness comes from how the measured volume was obtained, not from the conversion factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report significant figures based on the precision of the measuring instrument or context. The conversion itself does not add precision; carry the same number of meaningful digits and round only at the final reported value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative volumes or very large/small numbers?",
        "answer": "Mathematically you can convert negative or very large/small values using the same factor. For measured volumes, negative values are not physically meaningful; for extreme magnitudes, consider scientific notation and the limits of your data type or display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about calibration or regulatory compliance?",
        "answer": "Yes for regulated or safety-critical work. Use calibrated instruments, follow traceability procedures, and apply uncertainty budgets as required by applicable metrology or regulatory standards."
