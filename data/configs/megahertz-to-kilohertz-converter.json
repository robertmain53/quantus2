    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms frequency measurements from Megahertz to Kilohertz, enabling detailed frequency analysis.",
      "Frequency specifications span multiple scales. Understanding conversion is essential for electronics and radio.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 megahertz equals exactly 1,000 kilohertz."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MHz = 1,000 kHz. To convert megahertz to kilohertz, multiply by 1,000. For example, 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz, 100 MHz = 100,000 kHz.",
      "Some older equipment and technical documentation use kilohertz while modern systems use megahertz.",
      "Understanding frequency conversion helps with equipment compatibility and specification interpretation.",
      "This converter provides precise frequency conversions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Radio station: 88.5 MHz = 88,500 kHz.",
      "Example 2 – Electronics: A 100 MHz processor clock = 100,000 kHz.",
      "Example 3 – Transmission: A 915 MHz frequency = 915,000 kHz."
