      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms frequency measurements from Megahertz (MHz) to Kilohertz (kHz), enabling detailed frequency planning for FM radio, cellular networks, and RF communications systems. It is designed for RF engineers, telecommunications professionals, wireless technicians, and frequency spectrum planners.",
        "The Megahertz represents 1,000,000 Hertz or 1,000 Kilohertz and is the standard unit for expressing FM radio frequencies, television broadcasts, cellular networks, and microwave communications. Converting to Kilohertz provides intermediate frequency resolution for network planning and regulatory compliance.",
        "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 megahertz equals exactly 1,000 kilohertz, enabling accurate frequency conversions for FM radio engineering, cellular base station planning, wireless network design, and RF spectrum management across the VHF, UHF, and microwave bands."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The relationship between Megahertz and Kilohertz is straightforward and mathematically exact: 1 megahertz equals 1,000 kilohertz. This converter uses the standard conversion factor: 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz. The inverse relationship is: 1 kHz = 0.001 MHz. These conversions follow the SI metric system.",
        "To convert Megahertz to Kilohertz, multiply the frequency in Megahertz by 1,000. For example, 98.5 MHz (FM radio station) = 98,500 kHz, 2.4 GHz WiFi = 2,400 MHz = 2,400,000 kHz, and 5 GHz WiFi = 5,000 MHz = 5,000,000 kHz. This conversion supports frequency band allocation planning.",
        "FM radio operates in the 88-108 MHz band (88,000-108,000 kHz range), television broadcasts span multiple MHz bands, cellular networks operate in hundreds of MHz (2G/3G) to gigahertz range (4G/5G), and professional microwave systems operate in multiple GHz bands. Understanding these relationships is critical for spectrum planning.",
        "This converter provides precise frequency conversions for RF engineers, telecommunications planners, and frequency spectrum managers. Accurate frequency calculations ensure proper equipment selection, regulatory compliance with spectrum allocation rules, and optimal performance in competitive RF environments."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – FM radio band: FM radio stations broadcast in the 88-108 MHz band. A station broadcasting at 101.5 MHz equals 101,500 kHz, essential for understanding the FM radio frequency allocation scheme.",
        "Example 2 – WiFi frequency: WiFi 2.4 GHz band (2,400 MHz) converts to 2,400,000 kHz, useful for understanding frequency channel allocation and interference avoidance in wireless networks.",
        "Example 3 – Cellular 4G: A 4G LTE cellular network operating at 850 MHz converts to 850,000 kHz, important for understanding frequency band allocation across different cellular providers.",
        "Example 4 – Professional microwave: A professional wireless microphone system operating at 2.4 GHz (2,400 MHz) converts to 2,400,000 kHz, essential for ensuring compliance with FCC frequency regulations in entertainment venues."

        {
          "question": "What is the conversion factor from Megahertz to Kilohertz?",
          "answer": "The conversion is exact: multiply Megahertz by 1,000 to get Kilohertz. The relationship follows the SI metric system where 'mega' represents 1 million and 'kilo' represents 1 thousand, making the ratio exactly 1,000:1."
        },
        {
          "question": "What frequency ranges use Megahertz?",
          "answer": "Megahertz is used for FM radio (88-108 MHz), television broadcasts (VHF and UHF bands in hundreds of MHz), some cellular networks (2G/3G in hundreds of MHz), and lower microwave applications. Higher frequencies use Gigahertz (GHz)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do FM radio frequencies work?",
          "answer": "FM (frequency modulation) radio broadcasts in the 88-108 MHz band. Each station occupies a narrow frequency band (about 200 kHz wide). Tuning a radio dial involves selecting specific frequencies within this MHz range to lock onto individual stations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between MHz and GHz?",
          "answer": "Gigahertz is 1,000 times larger than Megahertz: 1 GHz = 1,000 MHz. Modern WiFi uses 2.4 GHz (2,400 MHz) and 5 GHz (5,000 MHz), while older FM radio uses 100 MHz, making GHz the standard unit for modern wireless communications."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are cellular frequencies organized?",
          "answer": "Cellular networks use specific frequency bands allocated by government regulators. 4G LTE uses multiple bands (Band 1: 2100 MHz, Band 3: 1800 MHz, Band 7: 2600 MHz, etc.). Each band has specific coverage characteristics and capacity."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is frequency bandwidth?",
          "answer": "Bandwidth is the range of frequencies a signal occupies. FM radio stations occupy about 200 kHz of bandwidth, cellular channels occupy several MHz, and modern 5G uses wide frequency bandwidths up to 100+ MHz for faster data rates."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does frequency affect wireless range?",
          "answer": "Lower frequencies (like FM radio at 100 MHz) propagate farther and penetrate obstacles better than higher frequencies. Higher frequencies (like 5 GHz WiFi) have shorter range but higher data capacity, influencing the design of wireless networks."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I convert MHz to other frequency units?",
          "answer": "Use these conversions: MHz × 1,000 = kHz, MHz × 1 = MHz, MHz ÷ 1,000 = GHz. For example, 2,400 MHz ÷ 1,000 = 2.4 GHz, and 100 MHz × 1,000 = 100,000 kHz. Most frequency converters support all units automatically."
