    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms frequency values expressed in megahertz (MHz) into kilohertz (kHz) using the SI prefix relationship. The mathematical relationship is fixed: prefixes 'mega' and 'kilo' map to powers of ten, so the conversion is deterministic and exact in arithmetic.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversions in engineering, RF design, test reports, documentation, and when preparing measurements for calibration or regulatory submissions. For measured frequencies, remember that the numeric conversion does not change measurement uncertainty or instrument resolution.",
      "Where applicable, consult calibration and measurement standards (for example NIST guidance and ISO 17025 for calibration laboratories) to understand how instrument accuracy and traceability affect reported frequency values."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "SI prefix rule: 'mega' (M) = 10^6, 'kilo' (k) = 10^3, so 1 MHz = 10^6 Hz and 1 kHz = 10^3 Hz. Converting between MHz and kHz therefore uses a fixed factor of 1,000.",
      "Arithmetic applied by this converter: multiply the value in MHz by 1,000 to obtain kHz. No intermediate physical measurements are performed by the tool; it performs an exact numeric scaling.",
      "When converting measured values, preserve and report instrument resolution and uncertainty. Rounding should reflect the significant digits justified by the measurement equipment and calibration certificates rather than arbitrary display precision."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic relationship: 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz",
      "Conversion rule: kHz = MHz × 1,000",
      "Reverse conversion: MHz = kHz ÷ 1,000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.001 MHz → 1.0 kHz (0.001 × 1,000 = 1)",
      "2.5 MHz → 2,500 kHz (2.5 × 1,000 = 2,500)",
      "150 MHz → 150,000 kHz (150 × 1,000 = 150,000)"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How do I convert megahertz to kilohertz?",
        "answer": "Multiply the MHz value by 1,000. Example: 3.2 MHz × 1,000 = 3,200 kHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic conversion between MHz and kHz is exact based on SI prefixes (1 MHz = 1,000 kHz). Any approximation comes from numeric rounding or from uncertainty in measured input values, not from the unit conversion itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report after conversion?",
        "answer": "Match the significant digits to the measurement instrument's resolution and the uncertainty reported on the calibration certificate (ISO/IEC 17025 guidance). For calculated values not derived from measurement, choose precision appropriate for the application."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement instrument limits or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a mathematical unit conversion only. For measurement limits, traceability, and uncertainty you should consult instrument specifications and calibration documentation; NIST and ISO 17025 describe best practices for calibration and reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from kilohertz to megahertz?",
        "answer": "Yes. Divide the kHz value by 1,000 to get MHz. Example: 5,000 kHz ÷ 1,000 = 5 MHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are MHz and kHz SI units?",
        "answer": "Hertz (Hz) is the SI derived unit for frequency. MHz and kHz are SI-consistent prefixed forms of hertz (10^6 and 10^3 times a hertz, respectively)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory considerations for frequency values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Frequency use and allocations are regulated by national authorities (for example, the FCC in the United States) and international coordination bodies. Unit conversion does not change regulatory classification—verify band allocations and licensing requirements with the appropriate authority."
