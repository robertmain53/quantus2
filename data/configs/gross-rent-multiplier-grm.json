    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes the Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM) as a quick screening metric: GRM = Property price \u00f7 Gross annual rent. It also shows the property price implied by a chosen target GRM, useful for scenario analysis.",
      "GRM is a simple, high-level indicator intended for initial filtering only. It does not account for operating expenses, financing, taxes, capital expenditures, or vacancy. Use it together with deeper analyses such as net operating income and capitalization rate before making investment decisions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Core calculation uses reported or estimated market value for the property and the total gross annual rent collected or projected across the asset. Inputs must be consistent in currency and period (annual).",
      "This tool follows good data-handling and verification principles: validate source currency, date, and whether rent figures are gross scheduled rent or actually collected. For guidance on data integrity and measurement practices, consult the cited standards.",
      "Accuracy caveats: do not use GRM as a substitute for cash-flow analysis. Round results conservatively, and flag any input with low data confidence. Maintain logs of input sources and dates to support auditability."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Enter the property price or market value (same currency as rents).",
      "Step 2: Enter gross annual rent (total expected or collected rent before expenses). If you only have monthly rent, multiply by 12 externally before entry.",
      "Primary formula: GRM = property_price \u00f7 gross_annual_rent",
      "Scenario formula: Price implied by target GRM = gross_annual_rent \u00d7 target_grm"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Property price = 300,000; Gross annual rent = 36,000 \u2192 GRM = 300,000 \u00f7 36,000 = 8.33.",
      "Example 2 (scenario): Gross annual rent = 50,000; Target GRM = 7 \u2192 Implied price = 50,000 \u00d7 7 = 350,000."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "GRM is useful for fast screening and market comparisons but omits expense and financing factors.",
      "Use GRM alongside NOI, cap rate, cash-on-cash, and a full due diligence checklist for investment decisions."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What does GRM tell me?",
        "answer": "GRM provides a simple ratio that expresses how many years of gross rent equal the purchase price. Lower GRM often indicates a potentially better value, but it ignores operating costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use monthly or annual rent?",
        "answer": "This calculator requires gross annual rent. If you have monthly rent, multiply by 12 before entering. Ensure all inputs use the same currency and reporting period."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can GRM replace a full financial analysis?",
        "answer": "No. GRM is a screening metric only. It does not consider vacancy, operating expenses, taxes, or capital expenditures. Always follow a full cash-flow and risk analysis before committing capital."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I avoid misleading results?",
        "answer": "Use verified rent figures (actual collected rent when available), document sources and dates, and avoid dividing by zero (ensure gross annual rent is greater than zero). Consider sensitivity testing with different rent and price scenarios."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are typical GRM ranges?",
        "answer": "GRM ranges vary widely by market, property type, and economic conditions. Use local market data to set reasonable target GRMs and compare similar assets."
