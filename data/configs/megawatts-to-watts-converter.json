    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs the exact mathematical conversion between megawatts (MW) and watts (W). The relationship is based on the International System of Units (SI) prefix 'mega' (10^6).",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversions, reporting, engineering checks, and documentation. The numerical conversion is exact, but measurement and instrumentation introduce uncertainty; see the methodology and citations for guidance on traceability and safety."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the SI prefix definition: \"mega\" means 10^6. Therefore 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts. This is a fixed multiplicative relationship and does not require context-specific coefficients.",
      "For practical engineering and compliance, remember that the numeric conversion is exact but meter readings and power calculations are subject to instrument accuracy, calibration, environmental effects, and applicable standards for measurement and reporting.",
      "For safe handling and workplace procedures related to electrical power systems, follow relevant electrical safety and measurement standards from national and international bodies. Refer to the citations for standards addressing units, measurement traceability, and electrical safety."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: watts = megawatts × 1,000,000.",
      "Reverse: megawatts = watts ÷ 1,000,000.",
      "When presenting results, choose an appropriate number of significant figures based on measurement uncertainty and reporting requirements; use scientific notation for very large or precise values (for example, 2.5 MW = 2.5 × 10^6 W)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 MW = 1,000,000 W",
      "0.5 MW = 0.5 × 10^6 W = 500,000 W",
      "3.7 MW = 3.7 × 10^6 W = 3,700,000 W",
      "5,000,000 W = 5,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 5 MW"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion between MW and W exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship is exact: 1 MW = 1,000,000 W. Any deviation in practice comes from measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration, or rounding for reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert watts to megawatts?",
        "answer": "Divide the value in watts by 1,000,000. Example: 2,500,000 W ÷ 1,000,000 = 2.5 MW."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I consider different rules for electrical vs. mechanical power?",
        "answer": "The unit conversion is the same regardless of the power domain. However, measurement techniques, instrumentation, and applicable standards for accuracy and safety may differ between electrical and mechanical systems; follow domain-specific standards and calibration procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I display?",
        "answer": "Choose significant figures based on measurement uncertainty and reporting standards. For calculated conversions where the input is exact, preserve the input's significant figures. For measured inputs, follow the uncertainty and reporting practices in standards such as NIST and ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or regulatory considerations when working with megawatt-scale systems?",
        "answer": "Yes. High-power systems present electrical and mechanical hazards. Follow applicable electrical safety standards, workplace regulations, and industry best practices when measuring, installing, or maintaining power equipment."
