    "introduction": [
      "This calculator offers multiple established approaches to estimate how much disability income protection you may need: income-replacement, expense-based, and a human-capital present-value approach. Results are high-level estimates to help you plan and compare scenarios.",
      "Use the inputs to reflect your pre-disability earnings, employer benefits, other income sources, and your intended benefit period. The tool does not sell policies or guarantee pricing; it provides calibrated estimates to support conversations with licensed advisors."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool implements three common methods: (1) income-replacement: target replacement ratio of pre-disability earnings less employer/state offsets; (2) expense-based: shortfall between monthly expenses and predictable income sources multiplied by the benefit period; (3) human-capital: present value of projected pre-disability earnings until a chosen retirement age using an annuity present-value factor.",
      "To support trustworthy handling of user inputs and privacy this tool follows general guidance from NIST on data minimization and security controls. Model outputs are numeric estimates derived from algebraic formulas and do not use or infer protected medical information. For professional liability and compliance guidance consult applicable ISO, IEEE, and local regulatory standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Income-replacement method steps: (1) compute monthly gross income = annual income / 12; (2) compute target monthly benefit = monthly gross income × desired replacement %; (3) subtract employer-provided benefits, state benefits, and other monthly income to find estimated monthly policy need; (4) annual need = monthly need × 12.",
      "Expense-based method steps: (1) start from current monthly living expenses; (2) subtract employer/state/other income to get monthly shortfall; (3) total coverage needed = monthly shortfall × benefit period (months).",
      "Human-capital method steps: (1) compute years to retirement = retirement age − current age; (2) compute present-value annuity factor = (1 − (1 + discount_rate)^(-n)) / discount_rate; (3) present value of lost earnings = annual income × PV factor."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 (income-replacement): $80,000 annual income, 60% replacement, no employer benefits → target monthly benefit = $4,000; estimated monthly need ≈ $4,000.",
      "Example 2 (expense-based): $3,000 monthly expenses, employer long-term benefit of 40% salary converted to monthly amount reduces the monthly shortfall; total coverage is monthly shortfall × chosen benefit months.",
      "Example 3 (human-capital): A 35-year-old with $80,000 annual income and retirement at 67 will see present-value lost earnings estimated by applying the discount-rate annuity factor across years to retirement."

      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",

      {
        "question": "Does this calculator account for taxes?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are employer benefits and state benefits included?",
        "answer": "Yes. Enter employer long-term/short-term benefit percentages and estimated state benefit percentage. Those reduce the estimated additional policy need."

      {
        "question": "Should I buy a policy equal to the calculator's recommendation?",
        "answer": "Not automatically. Use the estimate to inform conversations with a licensed insurance professional who can review occupation-specific definitions, policy wording (own-occupation vs any-occupation), elimination periods, and indexing features."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards and safeguards were considered?",
        "answer": "The tool follows data-handling guidance informed by NIST, cites ISO and IEEE best practices for method transparency, and recommends workplace safety considerations aligned with OSHA. These references are for governance and transparency and do not imply regulatory approval of estimates."
