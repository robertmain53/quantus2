    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms terahertz to hertz for detailed frequency analysis.",
      "Ultra-high frequency measurements in terahertz convert to hertz for calculations.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where 1 terahertz equals 1 trillion hertz."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 THz = 1,000,000,000,000 Hz. To convert THz to Hz, multiply by 1 trillion.",
      "Expressing frequency in hertz enables precise calculations.",
      "Understanding terahertz-to-hertz conversion is essential for optical engineering.",
      "This converter provides precise frequency conversion."

    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – 1 THz = 1,000,000,000,000 Hz.",
      "Example 2 – 0.5 THz = 500,000,000,000 Hz.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why express in hertz instead of terahertz?",
        "answer": "Base unit for calculations. Terahertz convenient shorthand for large numbers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the relationship to wavelength?",
        "answer": "Wavelength = 3×10^8 / Frequency. 1 THz ≈ 300 micrometer wavelength."
      },
      {
        "question": "What frequencies are visible light?",
        "answer": "Red: ~400 THz. Green: ~500 THz. Violet: ~800 THz."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are terahertz waves generated?",
        "answer": "Quantum cascade lasers, photoconductive switches, multiplication of lower frequencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the penetration depth?",
        "answer": "Terahertz penetrates clothing, some materials. Absorbed by water and metal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why not use terahertz for communication?",
        "answer": "Atmospheric absorption. Limited bandwidth in practice. Experimental only."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the speed of terahertz waves?",
        "answer": "Same as all EM waves: 3×10^8 m/s. Speed doesn't change with frequency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are terahertz measurements?",
        "answer": "Can measure to 0.1 THz. Broadband systems cover 0.1-5 THz range typically."
