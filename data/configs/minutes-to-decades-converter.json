    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates an input measured in minutes into decades. It is intended for quick, auditable unit conversions where the only input required is a single scalar number of minutes.",
      "The tool documents the time basis used for the conversion, lists alternative conventions, and highlights precision limits so users can choose the convention that matches their use case or regulatory requirement."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the mean Gregorian year (365.2425 days) as the base year length and defines one decade as exactly 10 such years. This choice aligns with common civil-time averages used in international standards and scientific work when converting between calendar-based units and fixed-duration units.",
      "When higher or lower precision is needed, the page lists alternative conventions (common year = 365 days, Julian average = 365.25 days) and shows how results change. This ensures transparency and repeatability for technical, legal, or compliance use."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert minutes to days by dividing by 1440 (minutes per day).",
      "Step 2: Convert days to years using the chosen year length. Default: mean Gregorian year = 365.2425 days.",
      "Step 3: Group years into decades: 1 decade = 10 years.",
      "Concise formula (default convention): decades = minutes / (10 × 365.2425 × 24 × 60).",
      "Numeric equivalences (for reference): using mean Gregorian year, 1 year = 525,949.2 minutes; 1 decade = 5,259,492 minutes. Using common-year (365 days) gives 1 decade = 5,256,000 minutes; using Julian average (365.25 days) gives 1 decade = 5,256,600 minutes."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 minute ≈ 1.90×10⁻⁷ decades (using mean Gregorian year).",
      "Example 2: 60 minutes ≈ 1.14×10⁻⁵ decades (using mean Gregorian year).",
      "Example 3: 1,000,000 minutes ≈ 0.19005 decades (≈ 1.9005 years using mean Gregorian year)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which year length does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "By default the calculator uses the mean Gregorian year of 365.2425 days. This gives 1 decade = 10 × 365.2425 × 24 × 60 = 5,259,492 minutes. Alternative conventions are listed and produce slightly different results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are there different answers for the same minute value?",
        "answer": "Different conventions for the length of a year (common year, leap-year average, astronomical year) change the minutes-per-year figure. For most practical purposes the differences are small, but for long-term scientific or legal calculations you should pick and document the convention that your stakeholders expect."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact given the chosen convention. Real-world accuracy depends on the convention selected and on rounding. We recommend keeping at least six significant digits for scientific work and documenting the convention used. For regulatory or safety calculations consult applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are leap seconds, time zones, or calendar reforms considered?",
        "answer": "No. This converter maps minutes to calendar-based decades using an averaged year length and does not account for leap seconds, time zone offsets, or historical calendar reforms. For timekeeping applications where leap seconds matter, use time-keeping standards and tools intended for UTC or TAI conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for regulatory reporting or engineering deliverables?",
        "answer": "This tool is suitable for exploratory and documented conversions. For formal regulatory reporting or precision engineering, confirm the required convention with the regulating body or standards referenced in your domain and use sources or calibrated tools that the regulator accepts."
