    "introduction": [
      "Use this converter to quickly translate area measured in square meters (m²) to square yards (sq yd). Typical use cases include real estate listings, construction plans, landscaping estimates, and academic or engineering unit translations.",
      "Results are produced from internationally agreed unit definitions so numeric outputs are suitable for technical work; for legal, survey, or regulatory reports confirm values with a licensed surveyor or the issuing authority.",
      "Conversion factors and procedural notes reference standards and guidance from measurement authorities and academic resources (NIST, BIPM, MIT) to support traceability and reproducibility."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This converter uses the internationally agreed definition of the yard in terms of the metre (1 yard = 0.9144 metre exactly). Area conversions square that linear relationship to produce the area factor.",
      "We carry full precision internally and present rounded results by default. For engineering, surveying, or regulatory submissions choose the number of significant digits appropriate to the measurement instrument and the governing code.",
      "When converting between units, be mindful of measurement uncertainty from instruments (tape, laser, survey equipment). For traceable results consult NIST guidance on measurement and calibration."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1 yard = 0.9144 metre (exact by international agreement).",
      "1 metre = 1 / 0.9144 yard ≈ 1.0936132983377078 yard.",
      "Area relationship: 1 square metre = (1.0936132983377078)² square yards ≈ 1.19599004630108 square yards.",
      "Conversion step shown: square yards = square metres × 1.19599004630108. Reverse: square metres = square yards ÷ 1.19599004630108."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1.00 m² → 1.1959900463 sq yd (rounded 1.196 sq yd)",
      "10.00 m² → 11.9599004630 sq yd (rounded 11.96 sq yd)",
      "123.45 m² → 147.779... sq yd (rounded 147.78 sq yd)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact factor does the converter use?",
        "answer": "It uses the squared linear relationship derived from 1 yard = 0.9144 m (exact). The exact multiplicative factor is ≈ 1.19599004630108 (sq yd per m²)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from square yards to square metres?",
        "answer": "Divide the square-yard value by 1.19599004630108. Example: 10 sq yd ÷ 1.19599004630108 ≈ 8.361274 m²."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I keep for construction or land planning?",
        "answer": "Keep precision consistent with measurement uncertainty. For rough estimates 2 decimal places is common. For engineering or tender documents follow project specifications or local codes; for legal boundary work use certified surveyor values and report uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the unit definitions traceable to national standards?",
        "answer": "Yes. The yard-to-metre relationship used here is the internationally agreed definition that is traceable to national measurement institutes such as NIST and international bodies like BIPM."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can measurement instruments or rounding make my converted area inaccurate?",
        "answer": "Yes. Instruments have finite resolution and users should propagate measurement uncertainty. For example, a ±1 cm linear error on a 10 m × 10 m area creates a larger relative error when expressed as area. For traceable uncertainty evaluation, follow guidance from NIST and ISO on measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion acceptable for legal documents or surveys?",
        "answer": "This converter provides mathematically correct conversions. Legal or survey-grade values often require certified measurements, calibrated instruments, and a licensed professional. Use this tool for estimates and verification, not as a replacement for certified survey reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some sources show 1.2 instead of 1.19599 as the factor?",
        "answer": "1.2 is a convenient approximation used for quick mental calculations. The precise factor 1.19599004630108 comes from squaring the exact yard-to-metre definition; use the precise factor where accuracy matters."
