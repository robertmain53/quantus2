      "lead": "This aggregate weight calculator helps you estimate the mass of granular materials (gravel, crushed stone, sand, base course) from either a measured volume or from plan dimensions (area × depth), accounting for density, moisture content, and compaction or swell factors.",
      "body": "In earthworks, road construction, and concrete production, you rarely handle aggregates by mass directly in the field. Instead, you work from volumes (truck bodies, stockpiles, excavated cuts, slab areas and thicknesses) and must convert those volumes into tonnes, short tons, or pounds for ordering, billing, and compliance.\n\nThis tool lets you:\n\n- Start from either a **measured volume** or an **area × depth** takeoff.\n- Apply a **bulk density (kg/m³)** appropriate to your material.\n- Include **moisture** to account for water in the voids or on the surface.\n- Apply a **compaction / swell factor** so that loose delivered material aligns with compacted in-place conditions.\n\nThe logic and terminology align with common civil engineering practice, making the calculator suitable for preliminary design, takeoffs, and on-site sanity checks. Always confirm final values against project specifications, laboratory test data, and applicable standards."

    "methodology": {
      "title": "Calculation method and formulas used",
      "body": "The calculator supports two main workflows:\n\n1. **From measured volume**  \n   You enter a volume in cubic meters, cubic yards, or cubic feet. Internally, this is converted to cubic meters using a unit multiplier. The base formula for volume-based weight is:\n\n   - \\( V_{m^3} = V_{\\text{input}} \\times k_{\\text{unit}} \\)  \n   - \\( \\rho_{\\text{wet}} = \\rho_{\\text{bulk}} \\times (1 + w/100) \\)  \n   - \\( W_{kg} = V_{m^3} \\times \\rho_{\\text{wet}} \\times f_{\\text{comp}} \\)\n\n   where:\n   - \\( V_{m^3} \\) is the volume in cubic meters,\n   - \\( k_{\\text{unit}} \\) is the selected unit multiplier (e.g., yd³ to m³),\n   - \\( \\rho_{\\text{bulk}} \\) is the dry bulk density in kg/m³,\n   - \\( w \\) is the moisture content (percent by mass),\n   - \\( f_{\\text{comp}} \\) is the compaction or swell factor (dimensionless),\n   - \\( W_{kg} \\) is the resulting mass in kilograms.\n\n2. **From area × depth**  \n   You enter length, width, and depth in meters. The calculator forms a volume and then proceeds as above:\n\n   - \\( V_{m^3} = L_{m} \\times W_{m} \\times D_{m} \\)  \n   - \\( \\rho_{\\text{wet}} = \\rho_{\\text{bulk}} \\times (1 + w/100) \\)  \n   - \\( W_{kg} = V_{m^3} \\times \\rho_{\\text{wet}} \\times f_{\\text{comp}} \\)\n\n**Density and moisture**  \nBulk density should reflect the material as placed or tested (e.g., loose or compacted). Moisture content increases the apparent density by adding water mass. The calculator implements this with a simple multiplier \\( (1 + w/100) \\), which assumes moisture percentage by mass.\n\n**Compaction / swell factor**  \nThe compaction factor accounts for volume change between loose and compacted states. A value of 1.0 implies no net change; values above 1.0 reflect swell (loose volume larger than compacted volume), while values below 1.0 reflect consolidation or shrinkage.\n\nResults are then expressed in multiple units (kg, metric tonnes, short tons, pounds) for convenience. Unit conversions are based on stable SI-consistent relationships (e.g., 1 t = 1000 kg, 1 short ton ≈ 907.18474 kg, 1 lb ≈ 0.45359237 kg)."

Laboratory testing indicates a compacted bulk density of 1,900 kg/m³ at a typical site moisture of 3% by mass. You assume a compaction factor of 1.0.\n\n1. Choose **“From area × depth”** as the method.  \n2. Enter **Length = 10 m**, **Width = 3 m**, **Depth = 0.20 m**.  \n3. Set **Bulk density = 1900 kg/m³**, **Moisture = 3%**, **Compaction factor = 1.0**.\n\nThe calculator forms the volume: \\( V = 10 \\times 3 \\times 0.20 = 6 \\text{ m³} \\).  \nWet density: \\( \\rho_{\\text{wet}} = 1900 \\times (1 + 0.03) = 1957 \\text{ kg/m³} \\).  \nTotal mass: \\( W = 6 \\times 1957 \\approx 11{,}742 \\text{ kg} \\), which is about **11.7 t**."

Set **Bulk density = 1700 kg/m³**, **Moisture = 5%**, **Compaction factor = 1.05**.\n\nThe tool converts 12 yd³ to cubic meters and applies the density, moisture, and compaction factor to estimate total weight.

For critical applications, supplement this tool with laboratory testing, field measurements, and professional engineering judgment."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What density should I use for my aggregate?",
        "answer": "Use laboratory test results (specific gravity and bulk density) whenever they are available, as these are the most representative values for your project and material source. In the absence of laboratory data, consult project specifications, national guidance, or reference tables for typical density ranges for your material type (crushed stone, gravel, sand, base course). Many public works agencies and materials resources provide typical ranges for common aggregates."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does moisture affect the weight calculation?",
        "answer": "Moisture increases mass by adding water weight. This calculator models moisture as a percentage by mass: the bulk density is multiplied by (1 + moisture/100). For example, a material with a dry bulk density of 1,800 kg/m³ at 5% moisture is treated as 1,890 kg/m³. In practice, you should base moisture values on oven-dry or standard field methods and apply laboratory corrections."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a compaction factor and when should I change it?",
        "answer": "Compaction and swell factors describe how the in-place volume of aggregate compares to its loose or delivered volume. Use project-specific compaction factors taken from specifications or test results whenever possible. As a rule of thumb, a factor around 1.0 means compacted in-place volume is similar to delivered loose volume, a value greater than 1 indicates swell (loose volume is larger than compacted volume), and a value less than 1 indicates consolidation or shrinkage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the unit conversions in this tool?",
        "answer": "Unit conversions follow SI-consistent constants (e.g., 1 yd³ = 0.764554858 m³, 1 short ton ≈ 907.18474 kg, 1 lb ≈ 0.45359237 kg). These conversion factors are stable and widely used in engineering practice. Always ensure that your project documentation and reporting use consistent units, and for very high-precision work or disputes, consult national metrology guidance on units and measurement practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this calculator for bid quantities and payment?",
        "answer": "Specify acceptance tolerances and test frequency in your contract documents. This calculator can support estimating, cross-checking contractor quantities, or reviewing supplier tickets, but it does not replace project specifications, approved mix designs, or laboratory control. For bid quantities and payment, follow the measurement and payment clauses in your contract and any referenced standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this tool for materials other than aggregates?",
        "answer": "Yes — enter an appropriate density (kg/m³) for the material. Concrete, lean mixes, and some soils can be approximated similarly if you have representative density and moisture data. However, specialized materials, lightweight aggregates, or materials with large void ratios may require project-specific testing. When in doubt, consult a materials engineer or geotechnical specialist before applying results in engineering or commercial decisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What good practices improve the reliability of my inputs?",
        "answer": "Use calibrated volume-measurement equipment (measuring tapes, laser rangefinders, or survey data), verify density and moisture from qualified laboratories or field tests, and document any assumptions used (e.g., typical density for a given gradation). For major works, consider periodic checks against truck scales, weighbridges, or in-place density tests. Good documentation and traceability help support both quality control and audit requirements."
