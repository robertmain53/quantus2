    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a numeric power value in megawatts (MW) to the equivalent value in gigawatts (GW). The relationship between the units is fixed and based on the International System of Units (SI).",
      "Use this converter for quick engineering estimates, reporting, or documentation. If you are reporting regulated measurements or instrument readings, apply appropriate calibration, traceability, and rounding rules described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a simple scale factor derived from SI prefixes: mega (10^6) and giga (10^9). This is a deterministic mathematical relationship and does not require additional inputs.",
      "For measurement-derived values, ensure instrument calibration traceable to national standards and follow measurement uncertainty and reporting rules from recognized standards bodies (see citations).",
      "When presenting results, choose an appropriate number of significant figures based on the accuracy of the original measurement and the context (engineering, regulatory filing, public reporting)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1 gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts (MW).",
      "To convert megawatts to gigawatts: GW = MW ÷ 1000.",
      "Example calculation steps: take the numeric MW value, divide by 1000, then round or format the result according to required significant figures or decimal places."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 MW → 500 ÷ 1000 = 0.5 GW",
      "1,234 MW → 1,234 ÷ 1000 = 1.234 GW",
      "0.99 MW → 0.99 ÷ 1000 = 0.00099 GW (showing that small MW values become sub-milli-GW)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This conversion uses the fixed SI factor 1 GW = 1000 MW, implemented as a single division by 1000.",
      "For instrument-derived values, always consider calibration, uncertainty, and appropriate rounding before publishing or using results in safety-critical decisions."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this the same as converting megawatt-hours (MWh) to gigawatt-hours (GWh)?",
        "answer": "No. MW and GW are units of power (instantaneous rate). MWh and GWh measure energy (power sustained over time). The numeric scale factor is the same (1 GWh = 1000 MWh) but you must include the time dimension when dealing with energy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I display?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the measurement's uncertainty. For laboratory-traceable measurements, follow ISO/IEC 17025 guidance and report uncertainty; for rounded public numbers, 2–4 significant figures are common depending on context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs a mathematical unit conversion only. For measurement uncertainty, calibration, or compliance, consult relevant standards and record traceability to national measurement institutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert backwards from GW to MW?",
        "answer": "Yes. Convert gigawatts to megawatts by multiplying by 1000 (MW = GW × 1000). Use the complementary converter or perform the inverse operation."
