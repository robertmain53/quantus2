    "introduction": [
      "The quick ratio, also called the acid-test ratio, measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations using its most liquid assets. It excludes inventory and other less-liquid current assets to provide a conservative view of liquidity.",
      "This tool provides two accepted approaches: the standard acid-test formula (current assets minus inventory) and a liquid-assets aggregation (cash, marketable securities, and receivables). Choose the method that best matches your reporting convention and data quality."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Standard acid-test: subtract inventory from current assets and divide by current liabilities. Use when inventory turnover is slow or inventory may not be easily converted to cash.",
      "Liquid-assets aggregation: sum cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, then divide by current liabilities. Use when you prefer an explicitly cash-focused measure.",
      "Ensure input values are taken from the same reporting date and properly netted (for example, use net receivables after allowances). Where possible, reconcile with audited balances and apply consistent currency and reporting period."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Standard: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets − Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities",
      "Liquid-assets aggregation: Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) ÷ Current Liabilities",
      "Round ratios to two decimal places for presentation. If current liabilities are zero, the ratio is undefined — verify inputs and reporting periods before using results."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example (Standard): Current assets = 100,000; Inventory = 20,000; Current liabilities = 50,000 → (100,000 − 20,000) ÷ 50,000 = 1.60.",
      "Example (Liquid-assets): Cash = 15,000; Marketables = 5,000; Receivables = 30,000; Current liabilities = 50,000 → (15,000 + 5,000 + 30,000) ÷ 50,000 = 1.00."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which method should I use?",
        "answer": "Use the standard acid-test method for general financial analysis and comparability. Use the liquid-assets aggregation when you require a cash-centric view of immediate liquidity. Document your choice for consistent reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are allowances, discounts, or write-offs applied to receivables?",
        "answer": "Inputs should use net receivables after allowances and expected credit losses. This preserves conservative measurement and aligns with common accounting practice."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are typical interpretation thresholds?",
        "answer": "A quick ratio above 1.0 generally indicates sufficient liquid assets to cover current liabilities, but acceptable thresholds vary by industry, business model, and seasonal cycles. Use industry benchmarks and trend analysis rather than a single cutoff."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main limitations?",
        "answer": "The quick ratio is a point-in-time metric and does not reflect cash flow timing, contingent liabilities, or access to credit lines. It depends on accurate, consistently prepared balance sheet inputs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results and what controls are recommended?",
        "answer": "Results are as accurate as the input data. Follow documentation, reconciliation, and access-control practices consistent with NIST controls for data integrity and ISO quality management guidance. Validate inputs against source ledgers and apply software testing best practices when automating calculations."
