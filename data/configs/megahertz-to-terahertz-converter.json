    "introduction": [
      "Convert values expressed in megahertz (MHz) into terahertz (THz) quickly and reliably. This tool uses SI prefix relationships so results remain consistent with international unit conventions.",
      "The conversion is exact under the SI prefix definition: prefixes change the power-of-ten scale of hertz. Use the guidance below to select appropriate rounding and to understand practical measurement limits when you apply the result in instrumentation, RF engineering, or spectroscopy."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Frequencies are measured in hertz (Hz). SI prefixes scale hertz by powers of ten: mega- means 10^6 and tera- means 10^12. Converting between MHz and THz is therefore a fixed, exact power-of-ten operation.",
      "We present the conversion as a simple multiplication so it is deterministic and suitable for automated tools and scripts. For real-world measurement use, consider instrument resolution, calibration uncertainty, and whether values represent center frequency, carrier frequency, or spectral components."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Use the SI relationship: 1 MHz = 10^6 Hz and 1 THz = 10^12 Hz.",
      "Therefore: THz = MHz × 10^-6. Equivalently: MHz = THz × 10^6."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 MHz = 0.000001 THz",
      "1,000 MHz = 0.001 THz",
      "2,400 MHz (common Wi‑Fi band) = 0.0024 THz",
      "1,000,000 MHz = 1 THz"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Conversion between MHz and THz is a fixed power-of-ten scaling: multiply MHz by 1e-6 to get THz.",
      "When using converted values for measurement or regulatory purposes, account for instrument uncertainty and consult traceable calibration references."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between MHz and THz?",
        "answer": "1 MHz equals 10^-6 THz. Numerically: THz = MHz × 1e-6. Conversely, 1 THz equals 1,000,000 MHz."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose significant figures when converting?",
        "answer": "Keep as many significant digits as warranted by your input's precision and the measurement instrument's uncertainty. For instrument-derived values, round to reflect combined standard uncertainty from the measurement and calibration certificates (avoid implying greater precision than the measurement supports)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the tool account for instrument calibration or measurement error?",
        "answer": "This converter performs an exact mathematical scaling; it does not apply measurement uncertainty corrections. For measurement-grade results, combine the converted nominal value with your instrument's calibration and uncertainty statements—traceable to standards such as NIST where applicable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert GHz or Hz the same way?",
        "answer": "Yes. All frequency conversions use the same SI prefix powers of ten. For example, 1 GHz = 1,000 MHz and 1 kHz = 0.001 MHz; convert via intermediate Hz if desired or apply prefix scaling directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory considerations when converting frequencies for radio equipment?",
        "answer": "Conversion itself is mathematical. For deployment and compliance, verify frequency allocations, licensing, and equipment authorization with relevant regulators (for example, the national spectrum authority) before transmitting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references on units and prefixes?",
        "answer": "Authoritative references include the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) SI Brochure and NIST publications on units and frequency metrology, which describe SI prefixes, unit definitions, and best measurement practices."
