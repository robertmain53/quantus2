    "introduction": [
      "Use this converter to translate data rates expressed in kilobits per second (kbps) into gigabits per second (Gbps) using SI (decimal) prefixes. This is the standard approach for network equipment specifications, service plans, and most engineering contexts where 1 kilo = 1,000 and 1 giga = 1,000,000,000.",
      "The tool follows internationally accepted SI conventions and provides practical notes on measurement accuracy, bits vs bytes distinctions, and how protocol overhead or measurement tools can affect observed throughput versus nominal rates.",
      "If you need byte-based conversions (KBps ↔ GBps) or binary-prefix (kibi, mebi) interpretations, see the related converters in our data transfer category for precise conversions under those conventions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This converter applies the SI (decimal) relationship between metric prefixes: kilo (10^3) and giga (10^9). Under that system, 1 gigabit = 1,000,000 kilobits, so the conversion is a fixed, exact arithmetic operation.",
      "Real-world throughput measurements may differ from the converted value because of protocol overhead (headers, ACKs), link-layer framing, encryption, and testing methodology. For measurement best practices and standard test methods, consult references from national measurement institutes and academic networking courses.",
      "Where relevant, we reference SI guidance and standards bodies to ensure the numeric relationship and terminology adhere to engineering and regulatory expectations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with the value in kilobits per second (kbps).",
      "Step 2: Apply the SI conversion factor: 1 Gbps = 1,000,000 kbps.",
      "Formula: Gbps = kbps ÷ 1,000,000 (equivalently kbps × 10⁻⁶). Example: 5,000,000 kbps ÷ 1,000,000 = 5 Gbps."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "900 kbps → 0.0009 Gbps (900 ÷ 1,000,000)",
      "1,000,000 kbps → 1 Gbps (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000)",
      "250,000 kbps → 0.25 Gbps (250,000 ÷ 1,000,000)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this converter using decimal (SI) or binary prefixes?",
        "answer": "This converter uses decimal SI prefixes (kilo = 1,000; giga = 1,000,000,000). For binary-prefixed quantities (kibi, mebi), which are sometimes used in storage contexts, use a binary-prefix converter because those use powers of 2."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between kilobits (kb) and kilobytes (kB)?",
        "answer": "A kilobit is 1,000 bits in SI terms; a kilobyte is 8,000 bits (since 1 byte = 8 bits). This converter works with bits per second. To convert kilobytes per second (KBps) to gigabits per second, first convert bytes to bits by multiplying by 8, then apply the same SI prefix conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my measured speed differ from the converted value?",
        "answer": "Measured throughput often differs because of protocol overhead (TCP/IP, Ethernet), packet loss, duplex mismatch, encryption, and test methodology. The conversion gives the mathematical equivalence; observed network performance may be lower. Follow standardized test procedures and document measurement conditions to get repeatable results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose rounding and display precision?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context: for user-facing summaries 2–3 significant digits are common (e.g., 0.25 Gbps), while engineering logs may record full floating-point values. Be explicit about the number of decimal places and whether values are truncated or rounded."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these conversions compliant with standards and regulatory guidance?",
        "answer": "Yes. The numeric relationships follow SI definitions endorsed by national metrology institutes. For application-specific compliance (telecommunications procurement, regulatory reporting), follow the applicable guidance from regulatory agencies and standards organizations referenced below."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small values without overflow/underflow?",
        "answer": "Mathematically yes: the conversion is a single multiplication/division by powers of ten. In software, ensure the numeric type supports the value range (use double precision or arbitrary-precision libraries for extremely large/small values) to avoid overflow or loss of significance."
