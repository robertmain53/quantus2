    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates bits (b) into kibibytes (KiB), the binary unit defined as 1 KiB = 1,024 bytes. It is intended for use in contexts where binary multiples are required, such as operating systems, memory sizing, and low-level storage reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Fundamental identity: 1 byte = 8 bits.",
      "Binary prefix: 1 KiB = 1,024 bytes.",
      "Conversion path: bits → bytes (÷8) → KiB (÷1,024). Combined: KiB = bits ÷ (8 × 1,024) = bits ÷ 8,192."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: kibibytes = bits ÷ 8,192.",
      "Example: 65,536 bits → 65,536 ÷ 8,192 = 8 KiB.",
      "Comparison: Under decimal prefixes, 65,536 bits would be 65,536 ÷ (8 × 1,000) = 8.192 kB."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "8,192 bits → 1 KiB.",
      "131,072 bits → 16 KiB.",
      "1,000,000 bits → 1,000,000 ÷ 8,192 ≈ 122.07 KiB."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "When should I use KiB instead of kB?",
        "answer": "Use KiB when you need power-of-two accuracy for software, firmware, and file systems. Use kB (decimal) for marketing specs or SI-based documentation. Always match the unit convention of your audience or standard."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the bit-to-byte factor different in binary contexts?",
        "answer": "No. 1 byte = 8 bits always. The difference between KiB and kB comes from the prefix (1,024 vs 1,000)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the result?",
        "answer": "The factor is exact. Round the displayed result to the number of decimals required by your report or SLA; keep full precision internally to avoid cumulative error."
