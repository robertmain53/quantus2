1. This is a converter because it converts a single numeric value from one unit (ounces) to another unit (pounds) using a fixed mathematical relationship (no additional inputs or methods required).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and may include examples[] or summary[] as additional flat arrays if useful).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no extra metadata like canonical_url, robots, schema_org, open_graph, keywords, or custom UI fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
