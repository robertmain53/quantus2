1. This is a converter because it converts between two weight units (ounces → pounds) that have a fixed mathematical relationship; the user supplies one value and expects one output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown or HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, styling, or other custom fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
