1. This is a "converter" because the task is a unit conversion between ounces and pounds with a fixed mathematical relationship, requiring a single input and producing a single output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and may include examples[] and summary[] as additional flat arrays if needed).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, not Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, no robots, no schema_org beyond the allowed schema.additionalTypes, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
