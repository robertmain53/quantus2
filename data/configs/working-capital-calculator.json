    "introduction": [
      "Working capital measures short-term liquidity and is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. It tells you whether a business has enough short-term resources to meet near-term obligations without raising additional capital.",
      "This calculator computes working capital plus two commonly used liquidity ratios: the current ratio and the quick (acid-test) ratio. It also expresses working capital as a share of total assets to help compare across periods or peers.",
      "Use these outputs to monitor liquidity trends, stress-test cash needs, and inform decisions on short-term financing, inventory management, and receivables collection."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Working capital = Current Assets − Current Liabilities. Current assets are assets expected to convert to cash within 12 months; current liabilities are obligations due within 12 months. These definitions follow standard financial reporting conventions.",
      "Current ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. A ratio above 1 commonly indicates that current assets exceed current obligations; however, acceptable levels vary by industry and business model.",
      "Quick (acid-test) ratio = (Current Assets − Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities. This removes inventory to show liquidity based on the most liquid assets (cash, equivalents, receivables).",
      "Working capital as a share of total assets shows how much of the asset base is committed to short-term working capital. For regulatory and reporting norms consult the Financial Accounting Standards Board and governing reporting guidance.",
      "Results are calculated from the user inputs using the exact arithmetic shown; the tool does not adjust for classification differences or accounting estimates. For audited reporting, use your audited balance-sheet line items and consult your accountant or auditor."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What inputs should I use for current assets and current liabilities?",
        "answer": "Use line items from your balance sheet classified as current under your accounting policy: cash and equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable (net), inventory, prepaid expenses, and current liabilities such as accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued expenses."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if current liabilities are zero or very small?",
        "answer": "A very small denominator can make ratios volatile. If current liabilities are zero, the current and quick ratios are undefined (division by zero). In that case interpret working capital in absolute currency terms and consult your finance advisor for normalization (for example, use rolling averages)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a higher working capital always better?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. Excess working capital can indicate inefficient use of assets (for example, excess inventory or receivables). The right level depends on the business model, growth stage, seasonality, and industry norms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these calculations for regulatory or audited reporting?",
        "answer": "The calculator performs arithmetic on the inputs you provide. For regulatory, tax, or audited financial statements rely on your accounting records, internal controls, and guidance from accounting standards boards (for example, FASB) or your external auditor."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I improve working capital if it is negative?",
        "answer": "Common actions include accelerating receivables collection, negotiating longer payment terms with suppliers, optimizing inventory levels, and arranging short-term financing. Each action has trade-offs; model impacts on cash flow before implementing changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which benchmarks should I compare against?",
        "answer": "Compare to prior periods, industry peers, and published sector medians. Industry trade associations, regulatory filings (SEC) for public peers, and government small-business guidance are useful benchmarking sources."
