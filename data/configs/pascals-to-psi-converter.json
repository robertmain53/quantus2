    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts pressure values expressed in kilopascals (kPa) to pounds per square inch (psi). Use it when you need a reliable numeric conversion between SI-derived pressure units and common imperial units used in automotive, HVAC, and industrial contexts.",
      "The calculator assumes numeric input is a pressure value in kilopascals. It does not infer whether the value is gauge or absolute pressure; confirm the measurement reference (gauge vs absolute) before converting for safety-critical or regulatory applications."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This conversion uses a fixed multiplicative relationship between the two unit systems. No empirical calibration factors or sensor-specific corrections are applied by the converter.",
      "For measurement and reporting that require traceability or compliance, follow recommended practices for instrument calibration and uncertainty reporting as described by NIST and ISO standards referenced below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: psi = kPa × 0.14503773773",
      "Equivalent formula: psi = kPa ÷ 6.894757293168",
      "Steps: 1) Confirm your input kPa value represents the correct reference (gauge or absolute). 2) Multiply the kPa value by 0.14503773773 to obtain psi. 3) Round the result according to required significant figures or measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 kPa → 14.5038 psi (100 × 0.14503773773 ≈ 14.5038)",
      "220 kPa → 31.9083 psi (220 × 0.14503773773 ≈ 31.9083)",
      "101.325 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure) → 14.6959 psi"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship based on defined SI and imperial unit definitions. The numeric factor shown is sufficient for typical engineering and everyday use. For laboratory-grade reporting include measurement uncertainty and instrument traceability per NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I handle gauge versus absolute pressure?",
        "answer": "Kilopascal readings may be gauge (relative to ambient) or absolute (relative to vacuum). This converter treats the numeric input as whatever the instrument reports. To convert between gauge and absolute, add or subtract local atmospheric pressure (approximately 101.325 kPa at sea level) before converting if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding or precision should I use?",
        "answer": "Select rounding based on the measuring device's accuracy and the required uncertainty reporting. For example, tire pressure is commonly reported to one decimal place in psi; laboratory work may require more significant figures and an uncertainty statement conforming to ISO 17025."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for safety-critical calculations?",
        "answer": "This converter provides the numeric unit conversion only. For safety-critical applications verify instrument calibration, measurement conditions, and applicable regulatory requirements. Follow calibration and competence standards such as ISO 17025 and ISO 10012, and any industry-specific OSHA guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I sometimes see pressure given in bar or Pa?",
        "answer": "Bar and pascal (Pa) are common metric pressure units. 1 bar = 100 kPa. The pascal is the SI base unit of pressure (1 kPa = 1000 Pa). Convert between these as intermediate steps if required."
