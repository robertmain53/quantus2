    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a distance value in kilometres (km) to miles (mi) using the internationally established conversion relationship between the metre-based SI kilometre and the international mile.",
      "The tool uses the defined constants used in metrology: one kilometre equals 1000 metres, and one international mile equals exactly 1609.344 metres. Results are presented numerically; choose display precision depending on your use case.",
      "For regulatory, legal, or safety-critical uses consult the cited standards and apply required rounding, calibration, and measurement-traceability practices described by national and international metrology authorities."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies a fixed, exact relationship derived from the metre definitions: 1 international mile = 1609.344 m and 1 kilometre = 1000 m. The conversion therefore uses exact derived factors.",
      "For display the tool multiplies or divides by the exact conversion factors. Any rounding shown is for presentation only and does not change the underlying exact value used for calculations.",
      "Accuracy guidance follows international metrology practice: present only as many significant digits as justified by the input measurement accuracy and the intended use. See citations for NIST, BIPM, and ISO references on units and measurement practice."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formulas used: miles = kilometres × 0.6213711922373339 and kilometres = miles × 1.609344.",
      "Derived from exact definitions: 1 mile = 1609.344 metres and 1 kilometre = 1000 metres, therefore miles = km × (1000 / 1609.344) and km = miles × (1609.344 / 1000).",
      "Rounding: the converter uses the exact factor internally; display rounding can be configured by the UI. For engineering or legal use, round according to the rules in the applicable standard (for example, specify significant figures or decimal places required by your procedure)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Convert 5 km to miles. 5 × 0.6213711922373339 = 3.1068559611866695 → display as 3.106856 mi when rounded to 6 decimal places.",
      "Example 2: Convert 0.1 km to miles. 0.1 × 0.6213711922373339 = 0.06213711922373339 → display as 0.0621371 mi when rounded to 7 significant digits."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use the exact conversion factors for calculation and apply rounding only for presentation.",
      "For measurement traceability, follow guidance in the cited metrology standards and your local legal metrology rules when reporting distances for regulatory or contractual purposes."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which definition of 'mile' does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the international statute mile, defined as exactly 1609.344 metres (the common international standard agreed in 1959). It does not use the nautical mile or historical local miles."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do results sometimes differ from other tools?",
        "answer": "Differences come from display rounding, the number of digits used for the conversion factor, or use of alternate unit definitions. This tool uses the exact metre-based definitions and only rounds for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust?",
        "answer": "Trust only as many digits as are supported by the original measurement's accuracy. For example, if a measured distance is accurate to the nearest metre, do not claim more significant digits in the converted value than justified. For formal use follow the rounding rules in relevant standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Mathematically the conversion applies to any real number, including negative values. For practical contexts negative distances typically indicate direction and should be treated according to your domain rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for legal or contractual measurements?",
        "answer": "This tool provides numeric conversions based on internationally agreed definitions. For legal or regulatory measurements, confirm required procedures with the appropriate legal metrology authority and follow traceability, calibration, and rounding rules required by that authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about 'nautical miles' and other mile types?",
        "answer": "A nautical mile is different (exactly 1852 metres) and is not used here. Select a specialist converter if you need nautical miles or historical local mile units."
