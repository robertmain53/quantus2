    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a pressure value expressed in kilopascals (kPa) to inches of mercury (inHg). The relationship is a fixed mathematical conversion when using the conventional definition of inHg tied to mercury column height under standard gravity.",
      "Use this tool for everyday engineering, meteorological and HVAC work. For high-precision laboratory or legal metrology, read the accuracy caveats below and follow calibration and traceability guidance to NIST and relevant standards bodies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is performed using the conventional physical relation that 1 inHg equals 3386.389 pascals under standard conditions for mercury column definitions. The converter applies that established factor and reports results to a reasonable number of significant digits.",
      "This conversion assumes standard gravity and the conventional mercury density implicit in the inHg definition. Temperature-dependent changes to the density of mercury cause slight variations; some industries use temperature-specified variants (for example, inHg at 60°F).",
      "For regulatory, safety, and calibration contexts, ensure instruments are calibrated with traceability to national standards and comply with applicable standards from NIST, ISO, IEEE, and OSHA as relevant to your application."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: inHg = kPa * 1000 Pa/kPa ÷ 3386.389 Pa/inHg.",
      "Simplified multipliers: inHg = kPa * 0.2952998307 (approximately) or inHg = kPa / 3.386389."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 101.325 kPa → 101.325 * 0.2952998307 = 29.9213 inHg (standard atmospheric pressure).",
      "Example 2: 50 kPa → 50 * 0.2952998307 = 14.76499 inHg (rounded to 14.765 inHg)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or does it depend on temperature?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion using the conventional factor is fixed for the defined inHg unit. However, real-world mercury column measurements depend on mercury density, which varies slightly with temperature. Some applications define inHg at a specific temperature (for example, 60°F). For traceable metrology, use the temperature-corrected factor and document the reference conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust?",
        "answer": "For general engineering and weather reporting, reporting 3 to 5 significant digits is usually sufficient. For laboratory or calibration work, specify uncertainty and follow the precision requirements of your standard or test method; do not rely solely on displayed digits without uncertainty assessment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need calibration traceable to a standards body?",
        "answer": "Yes. When measurements affect safety, compliance, contracts, or legal evidence, instruments should be calibrated with traceability to national standards such as NIST and follow applicable ISO or IEEE standards. Keep calibration records and stated measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between inHg variants (e.g., 0°C vs 60°F)?",
        "answer": "Variants arise because mercury density changes with temperature and some conventions specify inHg at a reference temperature. The numeric difference is small but relevant for precise work. Confirm which variant your procedure, instrument, or standard requires."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from inHg to kPa with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes. The inverse conversion uses the reciprocal factor: kPa = inHg * 3.386389. Use the appropriate direction and note the same caveats about reference conditions and uncertainty."
