    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts frequency given in kilohertz (kHz) to rotational speed expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM). It is intended for engineers, technicians, and lab personnel who need a reliable, standards-aligned conversion between temporal frequency and rotational speed.",
      "The conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) relationship between Hertz (cycles per second) and time. Because 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second and 1 minute = 60 seconds, converting from kHz to RPM combines the kilo (1000) multiplier with the 60 seconds-per-minute factor.",
      "Use the converter for quick checks, documentation, and control-system configuration. For measurement, instrument calibration, and safety-critical applications consult your calibration lab and applicable regulatory guidance before relying on a single numeric conversion."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Start from SI base definitions: 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. Kilohertz is 1000 Hz. Revolutions per minute counts cycles per minute.",
      "Derive conversion by converting kHz → Hz (multiply by 1000) and Hz → RPM (multiply by 60). The combined conversion factor is exact under SI conventions.",
      "When using converted values in control systems or safety limits, account for instrument accuracy, sensor sampling, and manufacturer specifications; consult accredited calibration references for traceable measurements (NIST and national metrology institutes)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert kilohertz to hertz: Hertz = kHz × 1,000.",
      "Step 2: Convert hertz to RPM: RPM = Hertz × 60.",
      "Compact formula: RPM = kHz × 1,000 × 60 = kHz × 60,000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 kHz → 1 × 60,000 = 60,000 RPM.",
      "0.5 kHz → 0.5 × 60,000 = 30,000 RPM.",
      "12.345 kHz → 12.345 × 60,000 = 740,700 RPM (exact before rounding)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Multiply the kHz value by 60,000 to get RPM. The factor is exact given SI unit definitions (1 kHz = 1,000 Hz; 1 min = 60 s).",
      "For measurement-grade results, report instrument uncertainty and use traceable calibration to NIST or your national metrology institute."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact mathematical relationship between kHz and RPM?",
        "answer": "RPM = kHz × 60,000. This follows from 1 kHz = 1,000 Hz and 1 Hz = 60 RPM (cycles per second → cycles per minute)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle significant figures and rounding?",
        "answer": "Preserve significant figures appropriate to your measurement uncertainty. For display use rounding to a sensible number of digits (for example, 3–6 significant figures) and document uncertainty when values are used in design or safety calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert RPM back to kHz?",
        "answer": "Yes. kHz = RPM ÷ 60,000. The inverse uses the exact reciprocal of the forward factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there practical limits or safety considerations when converting to very high RPM values?",
        "answer": "Conversion is arithmetic, but mechanical components and instruments have physical limits. For high RPMs verify material ratings, balance, bearing and seal specifications, and applicable safety standards. Refer to OSHA and industry standards for machine guarding and safe operating limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion for real measurements?",
        "answer": "The numerical conversion factor is exact by definition. Measurement accuracy depends on the sensor, sampling system, and calibration. For metrology or compliance, use calibrated instruments traceable to national standards and include measurement uncertainty in reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I go for calibration and traceability guidance?",
        "answer": "Consult accredited calibration laboratories and national metrology institute resources (for example NIST in the United States) for procedures on tachometer calibration, uncertainty budgets, and traceability."
