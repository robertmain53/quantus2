    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates the concrete volume required for rectangular beams and provides a quick conversion to mass and an estimate of pre-mix bag counts. Enter beam dimensions in metres and the number of identical beams.",
      "Calculations use a typical concrete bulk density of 2400 kg/m³ and include an adjustable waste allowance. Use these results for planning and procurement; always validate final quantities on-site and with structural drawings and local codes."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We compute volume per beam as length × width × height. Total volume is volume per beam × quantity, then increased by the waste allowance percentage you provide.",
      "Mass is estimated by multiplying computed volume by a standard concrete bulk density of 2400 kg/m³ (typical for normal-weight concrete). Bag counts are calculated by dividing mass by bag weight (25 kg and 40 kg) to give procurement guidance.",
      "This tool assumes rectangular solid beams only. It does not subtract openings, voids, or account for reinforcement displacement—adjust inputs to compensate or consult structural drawings for net poured volume."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Volume per beam = length_m × width_m × height_m",
      "Total volume (m³) = Volume per beam × quantity × (1 + waste_pct/100)",
      "Mass (kg) = Total volume (m³) × 2400 (kg/m³, typical)",
      "Bags = Mass (kg) ÷ bag weight (25 or 40 kg)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Can I use feet or inches instead of metres?",
        "answer": "This calculator accepts inputs in metres. Convert imperial measurements to metres before using the tool (1 ft = 0.3048 m). For quick conversions, use a dedicated length converter or convert manually."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the calculator use 2400 kg/m³ for density?",
        "answer": "2400 kg/m³ is a commonly used typical bulk density for normal-weight concrete. Actual density varies with mix design, aggregate type and moisture; consult mix specification or laboratory test reports for precise design values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for reinforcement, voids, or formwork bulking?",
        "answer": "No. Reinforcement and voids are not subtracted. If beams contain large voids or significant embedded items, subtract their volume from the gross beam volume prior to using this calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much waste allowance should I use?",
        "answer": "Common practice uses 3–10% waste depending on accessibility, site conditions, and pour complexity. For complex pours or small pours where overordering is costly, consult your contractor or supplier for recommended allowances."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are bag counts exact?",
        "answer": "Bag counts are estimates. Bag yield depends on mix proportions and bag packaging. Always round up and confirm with supplier yields and site batching practices before purchase."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to follow building codes or standards?",
        "answer": "Yes. This calculator provides quantity estimates only. Structural design, reinforcement, and construction tolerances must comply with local building codes and standards such as the International Building Code (IBC) and guidance from recognized authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these results in practice?",
        "answer": "For planning and procurement the results are reliable when inputs are accurate. Measurement errors, onsite variations, and mix density differences cause variance—verify with field measurements and supplier data before final ordering."
