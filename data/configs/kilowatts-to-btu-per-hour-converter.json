    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts electrical or thermal power expressed in kilowatts (kW) to British thermal units per hour (BTU/h). Use it to translate between SI power units used in engineering and HVAC units commonly used in building services, refrigeration, and heating specifications.",
      "Results are calculated using the standardized energy and power definitions. The tool provides guidance on expected precision and practical rounding for reporting. For safety-critical or regulatory calculations, verify instrument calibration and follow the referenced standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "A watt (W) is the SI unit of power and is defined as one joule per second. One kilowatt equals 1 000 watts. The British thermal unit (BTU) is a traditional unit of heat; BTU per hour is a rate of heat transfer. The conversion between these units is a fixed multiplicative relationship based on the defined energy equivalence.",
      "This converter uses the internationally accepted conversion factors and follows conventions from national and international standards bodies. For high-precision needs consult primary references and consider measurement uncertainty, instrument calibration, and the effect of rounding when presenting results."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Conversion factor (exact basis): 1 watt = 3.4121416331279 BTU/hour, therefore 1 kilowatt (kW) = 3412.1416331279 BTU/hour.",
      "Practical conversion formula (rounded for display): BTU/h = kW × 3412.142. For reporting, choose a rounding level that matches measurement uncertainty (typically 3–6 significant figures depending on instruments and context)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 5 kW → 5 × 3412.1416331279 = 17,060.7081656 BTU/h (display typically as 17,060.71 BTU/h).",
      "Example 2: 0.1 kW → 0.1 × 3412.1416331279 = 341.21416331279 BTU/h (display typically as 341.21 BTU/h)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What conversion factor does this tool use?",
        "answer": "It uses the accepted equivalence 1 W = 3.4121416331279 BTU/h (so 1 kW = 3412.1416331279 BTU/h). Displayed results are commonly rounded; check the rounding level against measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "Match significant digits to the precision of your measurement devices or required reporting standard. For engineering estimates 3–4 significant figures are typical; for instrumentation or calibration reports use more digits and include uncertainty bounds."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion affected by temperature or pressure?",
        "answer": "The pure mathematical conversion between kW and BTU/h is a fixed factor and does not depend on temperature or pressure. However, when converting from measured quantities (for example, volumetric flow and enthalpy) use temperature- and pressure-corrected thermophysical properties and follow applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I verify calibration or use standards?",
        "answer": "For regulatory compliance, performance testing, or safety-related calculations, verify measurement instrument calibration and follow relevant standards and test procedures. Consult the cited standards bodies for guidance on uncertainty, units, and reporting."
