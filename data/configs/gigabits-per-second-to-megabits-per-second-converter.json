    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms data rates from Gigabits per Second to Megabits per Second, enabling network capacity understanding.",
      "High-speed networks are specified in gigabits per second while consumer internet is measured in megabits per second. Understanding both is important.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 Gbps equals exactly 1,000 Mbps."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. To convert Gbps to Mbps, multiply by 1,000. For example, 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps, 10 Gbps = 10,000 Mbps.",
      "Enterprise networks use gigabits per second while residential broadband uses megabits per second. Converting helps compare speeds across contexts.",
      "Understanding network capacity in consistent units helps with infrastructure planning and speed verification.",
      "This converter provides precise data rate conversions for network analysis."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Fiber internet: A 1 Gbps fiber connection is 1,000 Mbps, approximately 10× typical broadband.",
      "Example 2 – Ethernet: A 10 Gbps Ethernet connection in data centers is 10,000 Mbps.",
      "Example 3 – WiFi 6: A WiFi 6 network supporting 1.2 Gbps is equivalent to 1,200 Mbps theoretical throughput."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Gigabits per Second to Megabits per Second?",
        "answer": "1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps. Multiply Gbps by 1,000 to get Mbps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my internet speed fast?",
        "answer": "Less than 10 Mbps: slow. 10-50 Mbps: adequate. 50-100 Mbps: good. Over 100 Mbps: excellent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is fiber internet?",
        "answer": "Typical fiber: 100-1000 Mbps (0.1-1 Gbps). Premium fiber: 1-5 Gbps or higher."
