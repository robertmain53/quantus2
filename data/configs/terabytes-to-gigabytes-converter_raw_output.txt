1. This is a converter because it converts between two data-storage units (terabytes → gigabytes) that have a fixed mathematical relationship and require a single input to produce a single output.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" for that reason.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converter, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, styling, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
