1. This is a converter because converting terabytes to gigabytes is a fixed, single-ratio unit conversion with one input and one output (no additional variables or conditional methods).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" for that reason.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and include examples/summary if helpful, also as flat arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, not Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url/robots/keywords/schema_org/open_graph/twitter_card, no extra UI or layout fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
