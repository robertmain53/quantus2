This conversion is essential for scientific analysis of motion.","This converter uses the precise relationship where 3.6 km/h equals exactly 1 m/s."],"methodology":["3.6 km/h = 1 m/s. To convert km/h to m/s, divide by 3.6. For example, 36 km/h = 10 m/s, 72 km/h = 20 m/s, 90 km/h = 25 m/s.","Vehicle speeds measured in km/h must be converted to m/s for physics problem analysis. Understanding both units enables practical-to-scientific translation.","Impact calculations, projectile motion, and fluid dynamics all require speeds in m/s. Converting from km/h enables these calculations.","This converter provides precise speed conversions for physics, engineering, and scientific applications."],"examples":["Example 1 – Car speed: 36 km/h = 10 m/s, typical local speed limit.","Example 2 – Highway speed: 100 km/h = 27.8 m/s, high-speed travel.","Example 3 – Wind speed: 45 km/h = 12.5 m/s, strong wind conditions."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from km/h to m/s?","answer":"Divide km/h by 3.6 to get m/s.
