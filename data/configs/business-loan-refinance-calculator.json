      "This calculator helps business borrowers compare their current loan against a refinanced loan or a change in payment frequency (for example, switching from monthly to bi‑weekly payments). It reports periodic payment amounts, total interest over the remaining life of each loan, estimated annual cash flow impact, interest savings, and an estimated break‑even period for any closing costs or prepayment penalties.",
      "Results are computed using standard amortization formulas and conservative assumptions. Use them for planning and initial comparison only. Always obtain official pay‑off figures and loan terms from your lender and consult an accountant or financial advisor before refinancing."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Periodic payments are calculated using the standard amortizing loan formula with the periodic interest rate = annual APR / payments per year, and the number of payments = term years × payments per year. The financed principal for the new loan includes the remaining balance plus optional closing costs and prepayment penalties when indicated.",
      "This tool follows software quality and accuracy best practices: calculation formulas are explicit and reproducible, inputs are validated for plausible ranges, and results include clear caveats. For operational security and data handling, follow applicable standards such as NIST guidance for secure systems and ISO/IEC standards for quality management where relevant. This tool is informational and not a regulated loan disclosure."

      "Example: $100,000 remaining at 6% APR with 5 years remaining (monthly) vs refinancing to 5% APR for 5 years with bi‑weekly payments and $1,000 closing costs. The calculator shows periodic payments for each scenario, total interest across each loan, estimated interest savings, and how many years until the $1,000 closing cost is recovered by lower annual payments.",

      {
        "question": "Does switching to bi‑weekly payments always save money?",
        "answer": "Switching to bi‑weekly payments increases the number of payments per year (26 vs 12) which can reduce interest over time if the loan amortizes with each payment and you do not simply split a monthly payment into two. Savings depend on whether the lender applies payments toward principal immediately and whether the payment amount changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the results exact lender quotes?",
        "answer": "No. Results are estimates based on the inputs and standard amortization math. Lenders may use different day count conventions, rounding, fees, or apply payments differently. Always request a payoff statement and a written loan estimate from the lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the periodic interest rate is zero?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses the standard amortization formula which assumes a non‑zero interest rate. A zero‑interest loan simplifies to principal divided by number of payments. If you enter 0% APR, interpret results accordingly and verify arithmetic."
