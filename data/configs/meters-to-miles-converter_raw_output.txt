1. This is a converter because the task is to convert a single numeric value from meters to miles using a fixed, exact mathematical relationship; it requires one input and one output only.

2. I will use component_type: 'converter' with logic.type: 'conversion'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), and no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, form for converters, or any extra UI fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
