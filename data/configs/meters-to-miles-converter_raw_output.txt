1. This is a converter because the task is a fixed unit conversion between meters and miles with a single numeric input and single output (no extra variables or conditional methods).

2. I will use component_type: 'converter' with logic.type: 'conversion'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, or other extra metadata).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
