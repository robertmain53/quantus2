    "introduction": [
      "This converter estimates US cups from a weight in grams for common flours using empirically measured bulk-density values and selectable measuring methods. Because a cup measures volume and grams measure mass, the conversion depends on the flour type and how the flour was placed into the cup (spooned, scooped, sifted).",
      "Select the flour type and measuring method to use the built-in density table, or choose the custom-density method to input a known grams-per-cup value. For precise work and regulatory compliance, use a calibrated scale and report mass rather than volume."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversions use the relationship cups = grams / (grams per US cup). The table values represent typical bulk densities for US customary measuring cups and common flour types, derived from published food composition resources and laboratory bulk-density measurements.",
      "Measurement uncertainty depends on material bulk density variability, moisture content, and measuring technique. For traceable accuracy follow NIST recommendations for mass measurement and ISO/NIST calibration procedures for scales. When accuracy is required for nutrition labeling or regulated product specifications, follow applicable standards (NIST, ISO, AOAC) and use mass-based measurements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: cups = grams ÷ density_g_per_cup",
      "Density lookup: density_g_per_cup is selected from an internal table based on the chosen flour type and measuring method (for example, spooned & leveled all-purpose flour ≈ 125 g per US cup).",
      "Custom-mode: if you know a measured bulk density (g per US cup), select the custom-density method and enter that value; the converter will use it directly."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 250 g of all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled (125 g per cup) → 250 ÷ 125 = 2.00 cups.",
      "Example 2: 120 g of cake flour, sifted (approx. 90 g per cup) → 120 ÷ 90 ≈ 1.33 cups.",
      "Example 3 (custom): If you measured density as 130 g per cup, 260 g → 260 ÷ 130 = 2.00 cups."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why do conversion numbers for '1 cup' vary between sources?",
        "answer": "A cup is a volume unit; the mass of one cup depends on bulk density, which changes with flour type, moisture, particle size, and how compacted the flour is. Different measuring techniques (scooping vs spooning vs sifting) change the packed volume and therefore the grams per cup."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to measure flour by weight or by cups?",
        "answer": "For repeatability and accuracy—especially in baking and regulated formulations—measure by mass (grams) using a calibrated scale. Volume measures (cups) are convenient but introduce variability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What accuracy can I expect from this converter?",
        "answer": "Typical uncertainty from packing and flour variability is on the order of ±5–15%. For critical uses, perform your own bulk-density measurement and use the custom-density mode or follow NIST/ISO scale calibration procedures for mass-based measurement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this use US or metric cup?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the US customary cup (commonly treated as 240 milliliters for culinary conversions). If you need a different cup definition, use the custom-density mode with a density adjusted for that cup volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do the density numbers come from?",
        "answer": "Density values are representative typical bulk densities compiled from food composition references and laboratory measurements. They are intended for general cooking and recipe conversion, not as legally binding values for commercial labeling unless verified by lab measurement."
