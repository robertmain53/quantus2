    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct SI unit conversion from metres (m) to micrometres (µm) using the fixed metric relationship. It is intended for quick, precise numerical conversions where the mathematical relationship is exact and no additional variables are required.",
      "For measurement work, note that numerical conversion is exact mathematically (1 m = 1,000,000 µm) but real-world measurement accuracy depends on instrument resolution, calibration, and relevant laboratory standards. See the methodology and citations for guidance on calibration and traceability."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the international system of units (SI) fixed scaling factors. A micrometre is defined as one millionth of a metre. The converter applies this exact scalar to the input value with no approximations.",
      "Where measurements originate from instruments or processes, treat the converted numeric value as derived from the measured quantity. Consider instrument uncertainty, calibration status, and applicable standards (for example, laboratory accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 and calibration traceability to NIST) when using results for compliance, engineering tolerances, or safety-critical decisions."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: micrometers = meters × 1,000,000",
      "Step 1: Take the numeric value in metres.",
      "Step 2: Multiply by 1,000,000 (10^6) to convert to micrometres.",
      "Step 3: Report with appropriate significant figures based on measurement uncertainty and instrument resolution."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.001 m → 0.001 × 1,000,000 = 1,000 µm",
      "0.000123 m → 0.000123 × 1,000,000 = 123 µm",
      "2 m → 2 × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000 µm"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical conversion factor is exact in SI units: 1 metre equals 1,000,000 micrometres. Any non-exactness in practice comes from measurement error, not the arithmetic."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose displayed decimal places?",
        "answer": "Match decimal places and significant figures to the measurement instrument's resolution and stated uncertainty. For laboratory results governed by ISO/IEC 17025, report uncertainties and round according to uncertainty propagation rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need calibration to trust converted values?",
        "answer": "Calibration of the measurement instrument is necessary to establish traceability and stated uncertainty. Calibration traceable to national standards (for example, NIST in the United States) ensures comparability and supports compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from micrometres to metres?",
        "answer": "Divide the micrometre value by 1,000,000 (10^6). Example: 500 µm → 500 / 1,000,000 = 0.0005 m."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety considerations when reporting measurements?",
        "answer": "Yes. For safety-critical or regulated applications, follow relevant industry standards and workplace regulations (for example, OSHA requirements for workplace measurements, and any industry-specific measurement standards). Ensure calibration records and uncertainty statements are retained where required."
