    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms fuel consumption values expressed as liters per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) into kilometres per litre (km/L). The conversion is a direct mathematical inversion and is exact: km/L = 100 ÷ (L/100 km).",
      "Use this tool when you need the intuitive distance-per-volume view (km per litre) instead of the volume-per-distance metric (L per 100 km). The conversion is used broadly in vehicle specifications, regulatory testing summaries, and consumer fuel-economy comparisons."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is derived from unit consistency: L/100 km indicates how many litres are required to travel 100 kilometres. To express distance per litre, divide 100 by that quantity to get kilometres that can be travelled on one litre.",
      "This calculator implements that exact inversion without intermediate approximations. For presentation we round results for readability; scientific, regulatory, or engineering uses should carry sufficient decimal places to match measurement uncertainty and reporting requirements (see citations to NIST and government fuel-economy guidance)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: km_per_litre = 100 ÷ (litres_per_100_km).",
      "Step 1 — Obtain the fuel consumption value in L/100 km (call it X). Step 2 — Compute 100 / X. The result is km/L. Example: if X = 8 L/100 km, km/L = 100 / 8 = 12.5 km/L.",
      "Units check: L/100 km → invert the fraction to get km/L. No additional empirical coefficients are required for the unit conversion itself."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "8 L/100 km → 100 ÷ 8 = 12.5 km/L.",
      "15 L/100 km → 100 ÷ 15 = 6.6666667 km/L (commonly rounded to 6.67 km/L).",
      "5.5 L/100 km → 100 ÷ 5.5 = 18.181818 km/L (commonly rounded to 18.18 km/L)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Converting between L/100 km and km/L is a straightforward mathematical inversion: km/L = 100 ÷ (L/100 km).",
      "For practical reporting, choose rounding that reflects measurement precision; for regulatory compliance consult the relevant test-cycle or agency guidance linked below."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why is the conversion simply 100 divided by the L/100 km value?",
        "answer": "L/100 km states litres needed for 100 km. To find kilometres per one litre, invert that relationship: 1 litre corresponds to 100 ÷ (L/100 km) kilometres. The operation is purely algebraic and unit-consistent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Round according to the precision of your source data and the purpose of the result. For quick comparisons, two decimal places are common. For engineering or regulatory work, keep enough digits to exceed measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for testing cycles like WLTP or EPA ratings?",
        "answer": "No. The unit conversion only changes how the same numeric quantity is expressed. Test-cycle differences (WLTP, EPA, etc.) affect the underlying measured value; convert the reported value but consult the issuing agency for how the number was generated."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I measure real-world fuel consumption to use in this converter?",
        "answer": "The common practical technique is the tank-to-tank method: fill the tank completely, set the trip odometer to zero, drive until the next full fill, record litres added and distance travelled. Compute L/100 km = (litres_added ÷ distance_km) × 100, then convert if desired. Account for filling method, evaporation, and measurement precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "What instrument or measurement limits should I be aware of?",
        "answer": "Fuel pumps and vehicle instruments have finite accuracy; odometer rounding and partial fills introduce error. For best results use calibrated meters, full-tank fills, and multiple runs to reduce random error. Refer to metrology guidance when tight uncertainty bounds are required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there standard references for these units and conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes. National metrology and energy agencies publish unit conventions and fuel-economy methodologies. See the citations below for guidance from measurement and fuel-economy authorities."
