    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates recommended personal umbrella insurance limits using three methods: an assets-based approach, an exposure-based approach, and a multiplier-style rule-of-thumb. It is designed to help you plan coverage to protect savings, earnings and property from large liability judgments.",
      "Results are planning estimates only and are not insurance quotes. Policies, exclusions, and state law differences affect actual coverage. Discuss specifics with an insurance professional and review policy language for underlying liability limits and exclusions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool aggregates your reported assets and short-term income exposure, evaluates household and vehicle exposures, and applies a configurable risk multiplier. For transparency, each method returns an explicit calculation so you can compare outcomes.",
      "Method design and data handling follow general risk management and data-integrity guidance. For secure handling and auditability, reference standards such as NIST risk-management guidance and ISO risk-management frameworks when implementing storage, logging, or integrations. This calculator does not store data unless explicitly implemented by the hosting service."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Assets-based: sum net assets (liquid, retirement, home equity, other real estate, personal property, business equity) minus secured debt, then add a short-term income buffer (annual income × buffer years).",
      "Multiplier rule: combine net assets and income buffer, then scale by a legal risk factor chosen by the user to reflect potential exposure amplification.",
      "Exposure-based: estimate likely judgment exposure from vehicles, drivers and household members using conservative per-unit exposure estimates, then apply the legal risk factor to create a recommended limit."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Household with $300,000 net assets and $100,000 annual income using a 3-year buffer and legal risk 1.0 yields assets-based ≈ $600,000.",
      "Example 2: Larger exposure: 3 vehicles, 3 drivers, 5 household members and legal risk 1.5 produces an exposure-based recommendation that can exceed underlying liability limits and suggests raising the umbrella limit accordingly."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this a binding insurance quote?",
        "answer": "No. This is an estimate for planning purposes. Actual coverage, premiums and available limits are determined by insurers and policy language. Use these results to inform conversations with an agent or broker."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the legal risk multiplier?",
        "answer": "The legal risk multiplier is a user-selected factor that reflects the likelihood and scale of a large liability event given your circumstances (high public exposure, business activities, rental properties, or repeat long-distance driving increase risk). Choose a higher multiplier if you have elevated exposure."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I use the outputs?",
        "answer": "Compare recommended limits from each method, examine gaps relative to your underlying liability policies, and choose a limit that comfortably exceeds the largest single-source exposure. Confirm subsidy, stacking, or policy exclusions with your insurer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are state laws and claims practices considered?",
        "answer": "This calculator uses generic exposure assumptions and does not model state-specific legal damages caps or venue-specific judgment patterns. For jurisdiction-specific advice, consult a licensed professional."
      },
      {
        "question": "What accuracy can I expect?",
        "answer": "Results are approximate. Accuracy depends on the quality of inputs and the match between the chosen method and your real-world exposure. Use multiple methods here as cross-checks and treat outputs as planning guidance, not legal or insurance advice."
