    "introduction": [
      "This calculator computes regular payments and totals for auto loans that include a balloon payment due at a specified time. It supports both bi‑weekly (26 periods per year) and monthly (12 periods per year) schedules so you can compare outcomes.",
      "Use the fields to enter the loan principal, annual interest rate (APR), loan term, balloon amount, and when the balloon is due. Results include the periodic payment, total amount paid (including the balloon), total interest, and a simple equivalent payment for cross‑comparison."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool models the loan as a standard amortizing loan with a future value (the balloon) remaining at the balloon date. The regular payment is computed so that, after making all scheduled payments, the remaining balance equals the balloon amount.",
      "Periodic rate is APR divided by the number of payment periods per year (26 for bi‑weekly, 12 for monthly). The formula for payment with a future balloon value is: P = r * (PV - FV / (1+r)^N) / (1 - (1+r)^-N)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1) Convert APR to a periodic interest rate r = APR/100 / periods_per_year.",
      "2) Compute total number of periods N = loan_term_years * periods_per_year.",
      "3) Use the balloon amount as a future value FV due at its specified period (balloon_due_years * periods_per_year). The calculator assumes the balloon is the remaining balance at the balloon date.",
      "4) Compute the regular payment P with the formula that accounts for FV, PV and N shown above.",
      "5) Total paid = P * N + FV. Total interest = Total paid - PV.",
      "6) For simple comparison, equivalent monthly or bi‑weekly payments are approximated by scaling by periods per year (these are approximation aids, not exact amortization conversions)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator handle balloons due before the final term?",
        "answer": "Yes. Enter the balloon due time in years. The calculator treats the balloon as the remaining future value at that time. If the balloon is earlier than the loan term, regular payments are still computed for the specified total number of periods; verify the balloon timing matches your contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are bi‑weekly results exact?",
        "answer": "The calculator uses 26 periods per year for bi‑weekly schedules. Some lenders use 24 or semi‑monthly schedules; confirm the lender's exact calendar and rounding rules. This tool provides financial estimates; see accuracy notes below."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I interpret the equivalent monthly payment?",
        "answer": "The equivalent monthly payment is an approximation: it scales the periodic payment by the ratio of periods per year. It is useful for quick comparisons but does not replace re‑amortizing the schedule to a different frequency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator include fees or taxes?",
        "answer": "No. Include fees by adding them to the loan amount or by adjusting the balloon amount if they are financed separately. For mandatory disclosures, rely on lender documents."
