    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts energy amounts from joules (J) to calories (cal) using the established thermochemical relationship between the units. It is intended for quick unit conversion in scientific, educational, and engineering contexts.",
      "Be aware that nutritional labels use the food Calorie (capital C), which is a kilocalorie (kcal) equal to 1000 small calories. Use the kilocalorie conversion when working with food energy."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally recognized thermochemical calorie definition. For clarity and traceability, we follow NIST/BIPM conventions for unit definitions and present conversions consistent with those standards.",
      "When reporting converted values for experiments or instruments (for example, calorimetry), include uncertainty from your measurement device and state the number of significant figures. For instrument calibration and traceability guidance consult national metrology and ISO standards."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Thermochemical definition used: 1 calorie (cal, small calorie) = 4.184 joules (J).",
      "Conversion formula (small calories): cal = J ÷ 4.184",
      "Conversion formula (food Calories/kcal): kcal = J ÷ 4184"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100 J = 100 ÷ 4.184 ≈ 23.90 cal (small calories)",
      "Example 2: 1000 J = 1000 ÷ 4184 ≈ 0.2390 kcal (food Calories)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which 'calorie' does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "By default this converter returns the small calorie (cal), also called the gram‑calorie or thermochemical calorie. For nutritional energy (food Calories) use the kilocalorie (kcal) conversion: 1 kcal = 1000 cal = 4184 J."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The thermochemical calorie is defined as 1 cal = 4.184 J by international convention and metrology practice. When converting, numerical results may be rounded for display — include instrument uncertainty separately when reporting measurements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I use?",
        "answer": "Match the precision of your input measurement. For calculated conversions, present enough significant figures to reflect input accuracy and instrument uncertainty; typically 3 significant figures are appropriate for general use unless experimental calibration supports higher precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert joules to food Calories shown on nutrition labels?",
        "answer": "Divide joules by 4184 to get kilocalories (food Calories). Example: 2500 J ÷ 4184 ≈ 0.598 kcal (about 0.6 food Calories)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I consider when converting measured heat from a calorimeter?",
        "answer": "Account for the calorimeter's calibration, heat losses, baseline drift, and stated measurement uncertainty. Trace measurements to national standards where required; follow ISO and national metrology guidance for calibration and uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert to other energy units from here?",
        "answer": "Yes. Joules and calories both convert to other energy units (kilojoules, electronvolts, BTU, watt‑hours). Use the appropriate converter for the target unit and ensure you apply the correct factor and significant‑figure rules."
