    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass value in kilograms (kg) to long tons (imperial long tons). The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship based on the definitions of the kilogram and the long ton and does not depend on material properties.",
      "Use this converter for quick unit changes in engineering, shipping, or reporting. For regulated or certified measurements (e.g., trade, safety limits, legal declarations), account for instrument calibration and measurement uncertainty per national and international standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses exact definitions: one long ton equals 2,240 pounds and one pound is defined in relation to the kilogram. Practically this results in 1 long ton = 1,016.0469088 kilograms.",
      "This calculator applies the fixed mathematical factor to convert between units. It does not estimate or include measurement uncertainty from weighing instruments. For traceable measurements and uncertainty reporting follow guidance from standards bodies such as NIST and ISO."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formulas:",
      "long tons = kilograms ÷ 1016.0469088",
      "long tons = kilograms × 0.000984206527611",
      "Calculation steps: (1) take the kilogram input, (2) multiply by 0.000984206527611 or divide by 1016.0469088, (3) round according to required significant figures or reporting rules.",
      "Recommended rounding: for most applications round to 6 significant digits; for regulatory or certified results follow your lab or agency rules for uncertainty and rounding."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 kg → 1000 ÷ 1016.0469088 = 0.9842065276 long tons (approx. 0.984207 LT when rounded to 6 decimals).",
      "5000 kg → 5000 ÷ 1016.0469088 = 4.9210326381 long tons (approx. 4.921033 LT when rounded to 6 decimals)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a long ton?",
        "answer": "A long ton (also known as the Imperial ton or UK long ton) is equal to 2,240 pounds, which equals 1,016.0469088 kilograms. It is distinct from the short ton (US) and the metric tonne."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is a long ton different from a metric tonne?",
        "answer": "A metric tonne (tonne) is exactly 1,000 kilograms. A long ton is 1,016.0469088 kilograms, so one long ton is 1.0160469088 tonnes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a deterministic mathematical conversion between units. It does not incorporate weighing instrument errors, calibration certificates, or uncertainty budgets. For traceable measurement and uncertainty reporting consult NIST and ISO guidance on measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which rounding or precision should I use?",
        "answer": "Select rounding based on your use case: presentation (2–4 significant digits), engineering calculations (4–7 significant digits), and certified reporting should follow your laboratory or regulatory rounding and uncertainty policies. When in doubt, keep more digits and document rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert to other similar units like short tons or metric tonnes?",
        "answer": "Convert kilograms to the desired unit using the appropriate factor: metric tonne = kilograms ÷ 1000; short ton (US) = kilograms ÷ 907.18474. For long tons use kilograms ÷ 1016.0469088."
