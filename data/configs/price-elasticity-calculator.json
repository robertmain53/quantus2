1. This is an advanced_calc because EBIT can be computed several valid ways (from income-statement line items, from net income by adding back interest and taxes, or directly from reported operating income), and users benefit from choosing the method that matches the data they have.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as arrays of strings).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or other custom fields). The JSON will follow the exact schema allowed for advanced_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
