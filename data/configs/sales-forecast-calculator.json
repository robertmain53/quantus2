    "introduction": [
      "Use this Sales Forecast Calculator to convert your current revenue and monthly growth assumptions into clear, numeric projections. It computes end-period revenue, aggregate revenue across the forecast horizon, average monthly revenue, and an optional churn-adjusted projection.",
      "This tool is intended for short- to medium-term planning (1–60 months). It uses standard compound growth formulas so you can compare scenarios or run sensitivity checks by changing growth and churn inputs."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary method: discrete monthly compound growth. Each month is modeled as prior_month_revenue × (1 + monthly_growth_rate). This yields an end-period value of current_revenue × (1 + g)^N where g is the monthly growth rate and N is the number of months.",
      "Total revenue for the forecast horizon is calculated using the geometric series sum for a sequence of monthly values. A separate churn-adjusted projection uses net monthly growth = monthly_growth_rate - monthly_churn_rate to estimate retained revenue under steady churn assumptions.",
      "This calculator is deterministic and rule-based. For improved accuracy with rich historical data consider statistical time-series models (moving averages, ARIMA, seasonal decomposition) and validate forecasts using backtesting and forecast accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Forecasted revenue after N months = current_revenue × (1 + monthly_growth_pct/100)^periods",
      "Total projected revenue (N months, including base month) = current_revenue × ( (1 + monthly_growth_pct/100)^periods - 1 ) / (monthly_growth_pct/100)",
      "Churn-adjusted revenue after N months = current_revenue × (1 + (monthly_growth_pct - monthly_churn_pct)/100)^periods",
      "Implied annual growth (%) = ( (1 + monthly_growth_pct/100)^12 - 1 ) × 100"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: current_revenue = 10,000, monthly_growth_pct = 2, periods = 12 → forecasted_revenue_end = 10,000 × (1.02)^12 ≈ 12,682.",
      "Example with churn: current_revenue = 10,000, monthly_growth_pct = 2, monthly_churn_pct = 0.5, periods = 12 → churn-adjusted uses net monthly growth 1.5%."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What inputs produce the most reliable forecasts?",
        "answer": "Quality forecasts start with accurate base-period revenue and realistic month-over-month growth estimates derived from historical trends, marketing plans, and pipeline conversion rates. Use backtesting against past months to calibrate the monthly growth rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose the forecast horizon?",
        "answer": "Short horizons (1–6 months) are more reliable for operational planning; medium horizons (6–24 months) help budgeting; longer horizons require scenario analysis and should incorporate structural assumptions (new products, pricing changes, market shifts)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the total projected revenue formula divide by the growth rate?",
        "answer": "The division arises from summing a geometric series of monthly values. If you expect zero growth, interpret the total as current_revenue × periods (a flat-line scenario)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I account for seasonality or step changes?",
        "answer": "For seasonality or discrete changes, run scenario runs per season (adjust monthly_growth_pct for each period) or use a statistical time-series model that supports seasonal components. This calculator assumes constant monthly growth for simplicity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I measure forecast accuracy?",
        "answer": "Track actuals versus forecast and compute accuracy metrics such as MAPE, MAE, or RMSE. Use historical holdouts (backtesting) to estimate expected error and widen scenario bands accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is churn handled automatically?",
        "answer": "Churn is modeled as a steady monthly percentage that reduces net growth. For cohort-based churn or non-linear retention, use cohort analysis or a customer lifetime value model for more precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the tool's limitations?",
        "answer": "This deterministic calculator uses simple compound growth and constant churn assumptions. It does not infer seasonality, correlations, or volatility from raw historical series—statistical forecasting models are needed for those capabilities."
