    "introduction": [
      "Market capitalization is the product of a company's shares outstanding and its current share price. It provides a snapshot of company size used widely in investing, index construction, and regulatory reporting.",
      "This calculator computes market capitalization from the values you provide and includes an optional free-float adjustment to reflect the portion of shares readily tradable in the market. Use the reporting currency field to document the currency of the share price; currency conversion is not performed automatically."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary calculation: multiply shares outstanding by share price, then apply free-float percent if you want a tradable-market estimate rather than total-issued shares.",
      "Precision and numeric behavior follow common engineering and data-quality practices; be aware of floating-point rounding and presentational rounding. For deterministic financial systems implementers should follow IEEE 754 guidance for binary floating-point or a fixed-point/decimal arithmetic standard appropriate to regulatory reporting.",
      "For quality assurance, logging, and auditability follow organizational controls and data-quality standards (for example ISO data-quality best practices). For secure handling, follow NIST recommendations on software and data integrity. For workplace and procedural safety consult applicable occupational rules."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: Market Cap = Shares Outstanding × Share Price.",
      "Optional free-float adjustment: Market Cap (free-float) = Shares Outstanding × Share Price × (Free-Float % / 100).",
      "To convert to billions, divide the resulting market cap by 1,000,000,000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 50,000,000 shares × $12.00/share with free-float 100% → Market Cap = 600,000,000 (600 million).",
      "Example 2: 200,000,000 shares × €4.50/share with free-float 85% → Market Cap (free-float) = 200,000,000 × 4.50 × 0.85 = €765,000,000."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this tool convert currencies?",
        "answer": "No. Enter the share price in the reporting currency you intend to use. If you need conversion, convert the share price to the target currency before using this calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between total market cap and free-float market cap?",
        "answer": "Total market cap uses all issued shares. Free-float market cap multiplies by the percentage of shares that are publicly tradable, excluding locked-in holdings such as large insiders or government stakes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are results for very large numbers?",
        "answer": "This calculator uses basic numeric arithmetic. For production or regulatory reporting systems, use decimal-based arithmetic or validated libraries and follow IEEE 754 guidance to avoid rounding anomalies. Validate results against authoritative data sources before publication."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the tool account for convertible securities, options, or diluted shares?",
        "answer": "No. If you need fully diluted market capitalization include conversions and outstanding dilutive instruments in the shares outstanding input or perform a separate diluted calculation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there compliance or audit considerations?",
        "answer": "Yes. Maintain an auditable trail of inputs, timestamps, currency, and calculation method. For controls and data integrity follow applicable internal policies and standards referenced in the methodology section."
