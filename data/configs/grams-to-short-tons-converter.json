    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a mass value given in grams to US short tons (commonly referred to as short tons). The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship based on the internationally defined kilogram and the defined relationship between the pound and the kilogram.",
      "Use this tool for quick, precise conversions. For legal, shipping, or commercial transactions use calibrated measurement equipment and follow local weights and measures regulations; see the citations for standards and compliance guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed by converting grams to kilograms, then kilograms to pounds using the exact definition 1 pound = 0.45359237 kilograms, and then converting pounds to short tons where 1 short ton = 2000 pounds. This sequence follows international unit definitions and preserves numerical precision.",
      "Recommended numerical handling follows IEEE 754 floating-point considerations for display and intermediate computation. For legal-for-trade or regulated measurements, use instruments and procedures traceable to national standards as described by NIST and relevant ISO guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert grams to kilograms: kilograms = grams × 0.001",
      "Step 2: Convert kilograms to pounds: pounds = kilograms ÷ 0.45359237",
      "Step 3: Convert pounds to short tons: short_tons = pounds ÷ 2000",
      "Combined one-step formula: short_tons = grams × (0.001 ÷ 0.45359237 ÷ 2000) = grams × 1.1023113109243914e-6"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 gram = 1 × 1.1023113109243914e-6 short tons (approximately 0.00000110231131 short tons).",
      "Example 2: 1,000 grams (1 kilogram) = 0.0011023113109243914 short tons (approximately 0.00110231131 short tons).",
      "Example 3: 1,000,000 grams = 1.1023113109243914 short tons (approximately 1.10231131 short tons)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a short ton and how does it differ from a metric tonne?",
        "answer": "A US short ton equals 2000 pounds. A metric tonne (tonne) equals 1000 kilograms. Because 1 pound = 0.45359237 kg exactly, the short ton is approximately 907.18474 kilograms while the metric tonne is exactly 1000 kilograms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust in the result?",
        "answer": "For display, showing 6 to 9 significant digits is usually sufficient for most applications. For legal or laboratory work, follow the uncertainty and rounding rules applicable to your field and traceable instrument calibration. Floating point representation may introduce tiny rounding differences; see IEEE 754 guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any limits where this conversion is not valid?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship is exact given the defined constants. Practical limits arise from numeric overflow/underflow in computing environments and from measurement uncertainty when values come from instruments. For extremely large values verify your system's numeric range; for extremely small values consider significant-figure reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a special calibration or certification to use converted values in trade?",
        "answer": "Yes. For commercial transactions and regulated trade, weighing instruments must be calibrated, maintained, and certified according to local weights and measures authorities. Refer to national standards such as those published by NIST and to relevant regulations in your jurisdiction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does 1 gram convert to such a small number of short tons?",
        "answer": "A short ton is a very large mass (2000 pounds ≈ 907.18474 kg). One gram is one thousandth of a kilogram, so when converted to short tons the numeric result is a small fraction (about 1.1023 × 10^-6 short tons per gram)."
