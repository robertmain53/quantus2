    "introduction": [
      "Convert Japanese yen (JPY) to US dollars (USD) quickly using live mid‑market exchange rates. This tool shows the mathematical conversion and clarifies how displayed results relate to bank or provider quotes.",
      "Displayed conversions reflect the current aggregated spot rate and simple currency arithmetic. They do not include transfer fees, provider spreads, or local taxes — which can change the delivered amount when you send or receive funds."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Rates: the converter presents an aggregated mid‑market (spot) JPY→USD rate refreshed regularly. Mid‑market rates represent the midpoint between buy and sell prices observed in global FX liquidity and are a standard reference used across finance (see ISO 4217 and central bank publications).",
      "Calculation: the engine multiplies the amount in JPY by the current JPY→USD spot rate to produce a USD amount. For reverse calculations, it uses the reciprocal of the spot rate. Results are rounded to standard currency precision (two decimal places) unless otherwise specified.",
      "Transparency & limits: displayed results exclude provider fees and execution spreads. For transfers, settlement amounts can differ for large transactions, cross‑border controls, or when banks apply minimum or tiered fees. Check official central bank publications or treasury data for historical and official reference rates."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1 — Obtain spot rate R (JPY per USD expressed as JPY→USD): use current aggregated mid‑market JPY→USD quote.",
      "Step 2 — Multiply: USD = JPY_amount × R.",
      "Step 3 — Round: round USD to two decimal places for display. For reverse conversion: JPY = USD_amount ÷ R.",
      "Notes: when R is quoted as USD per JPY, invert accordingly. Large sums may require bank confirmation due to limits, compliance checks, or bilateral pricing."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exchange rate am I seeing?",
        "answer": "You are seeing an aggregated mid‑market spot rate (a reference midpoint between buy and sell prices). It is intended for quick conversions and comparison; it does not include retail margins, transfer fees, or taxes applied by payment providers or banks."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often are rates updated?",
        "answer": "Rates are refreshed frequently to reflect live market liquidity. For authoritative historical or official daily rates, consult central bank publications or statistical releases such as the Federal Reserve H.10 or the Bank of Japan statistics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my bank's quoted amount differ?",
        "answer": "Banks and money‑transfer services add a spread and may apply fixed or percentage fees, plus local and correspondent bank charges. They may also use delayed or proprietary rates. Always compare the mid‑market reference with the delivered rate and fee schedule."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is rounding handled?",
        "answer": "Displayed USD amounts are rounded to two decimal places, the standard for USD settlement. Rounding rules follow common financial practice; for high‑precision needs (large institutional settlements), ask your counterparty for exact settlement instructions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for bookkeeping or regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "This converter is suitable for quick checks and estimations. For regulatory or audited reporting, use rates specified by the relevant authority or your accounting policy (for example, end‑of‑day central bank rates or an approved exchange rate provider) and document the source and timestamp."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limits on amounts I can convert here?",
        "answer": "This tool performs arithmetic conversions and does not execute transfers. For actual payments, providers impose limits, compliance checks, and KYC requirements that vary by jurisdiction and amount."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I verify the official currency codes and standards?",
        "answer": "Official currency identifiers and standards are published by ISO 4217. Refer to ISO documentation when mapping currencies for reporting or integrations."
