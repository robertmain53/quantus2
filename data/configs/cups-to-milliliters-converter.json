    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts volumes expressed in US customary cups to milliliters (mL). Use it when a recipe, lab note, or specification lists volume in cups and you need an SI-compatible result.",
      "The tool assumes the US customary cup definition (1 US cup = 236.5882365 mL). If you need conversions for a metric cup (250 mL) or an imperial/UK cup, select the appropriate unit elsewhere or apply the alternate factor noted below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the fixed mathematical relationship between the two units: 1 US cup = 236.5882365 milliliters. The number is consistent with published measurement references and common metrology practice for converting customary to SI units.",
      "For high-accuracy needs (laboratory preparations, regulated labeling, or calibrated dispensing) use properly calibrated volumetric instruments and account for temperature, meniscus reading, and fluid properties. This converter gives a direct numeric conversion but does not replace calibrated measurement procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: milliliters = cups × 236.5882365",
      "Example calculation steps: (a) enter the volume in US cups; (b) multiply by 236.5882365 to get mL; (c) round or format the result based on required significant figures or regulatory rounding rules.",
      "Alternate cup definitions: metric cup = 250 mL (use factor 250), UK/imperial cup ≈ 284.13125 mL (use factor 284.13125). Choose the factor that matches your source."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2 US cups → 2 × 236.5882365 = 473.176473 mL (report as 473.18 mL if rounding to 2 decimal places).",
      "0.5 US cup → 0.5 × 236.5882365 = 118.29411825 mL (round as needed for the application)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which \"cup\" does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the US customary cup (1 US cup = 236.5882365 mL). If you require a metric cup (250 mL) or an imperial/UK cup (≈284.13125 mL), use the corresponding factor or a converter configured for that cup type."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the conversion?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact to the given factor. Practical measurement accuracy depends on how the volume was measured (instrument calibration, temperature, meniscus reading). For regulated or laboratory use, follow calibration and uncertainty procedures as described by national metrology guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to consider temperature or fluid properties?",
        "answer": "For most kitchen use, no. For scientific, industrial, or legal applications, temperature, density, and evaporation can affect measured volume. Use calibrated volumetric glassware or gravimetric methods and apply correction factors as required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result?",
        "answer": "Round based on application requirements: recipes often use 1–2 significant figures; lab work may require uncertainty-based rounding per metrology standards. When in doubt, preserve extra digits then round at the final reporting step."
