1. This is an advanced_calc because the Inventory Turnover calculation benefits from multiple methods and conditional inputs — e.g., COGS-based turnover (COGS ÷ average inventory), Sales-based turnover (net sales ÷ average inventory) as an alternate benchmark, and multiple ways to compute average inventory (direct average of beginning and ending, weighted average of several periods). Users may switch between methods and expect derived outputs (turnover ratio, inventory days) that depend on selected variables.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata like canonical_url, robots, keywords, no UI/layout fields, no form for converters, no custom fields beyond the schema).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.
