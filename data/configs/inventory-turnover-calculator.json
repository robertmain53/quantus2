1. This is a simple_calc because the inventory turnover ratio requires multiple related inputs (for example, cost of goods sold and average inventory) and produces one primary computed output; it is a formula-based calculator rather than a unit conversion or a multi-method workflow.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as arrays of strings).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or other extra metadata; the form object will follow the schema exactly).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
