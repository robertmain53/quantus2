1. This is an "advanced_calc" because users expect multiple related torque workflows (force×lever arm, bolt preload from torque, power↔torque↔rpm conversions, hinge/damper torque estimates, and motor sizing). The tool must switch methods and adapt inputs/assumptions, so a multi-method advanced calculator is required.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples[]/summary[]/glossary[]), with no nested objects or HTML.

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slugs, no extra metadata, no UI/layout keys, no form object for converter-only cases, etc.).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
