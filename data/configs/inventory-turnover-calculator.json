    "introduction": [
      "Inventory turnover measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It is commonly calculated as Cost of Goods Sold divided by average inventory and helps assess working capital efficiency.",
      "This calculator computes inventory turnover (times) and average days in inventory from user-provided COGS and beginning/ending inventory balances. Use the period length in days (for example, 365 for a full year).",
      "Interpretation depends on industry norms, inventory valuation method (FIFO/LIFO/weighted average), and company mix. See citations for authoritative guidance and benchmarking sources."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formula: Inventory turnover = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory, where Average inventory = (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2. This is the standard practical approach used in financial analysis and by small-business guidance.",
      "Average days in inventory = Period length in days / Inventory turnover. When turnover is low or average inventory is zero, the result is undefined or very large; handle zero or near-zero average inventory as an exception in your analysis.",
      "Valuation note: Inventory measurement method affects both COGS and inventory balances. Adjustments or alternative formulas (for example, using net realizable value or weighted-period averages) may be necessary for accurate comparisons across firms or accounting policies.",
      "Frequency and benchmarking: Calculate turnover consistently (monthly, quarterly, or annually) and compare with industry-specific benchmarks. Use government and academic sources for sector benchmarks and seasonality patterns."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which numbers should I enter for COGS and inventory?",
        "answer": "Enter the period's Cost of Goods Sold (matching the same period as your inventory balances) and the inventory values at the start and end of the same period. Use consistent accounting policies for comparability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my beginning and ending inventory are very different or seasonal?",
        "answer": "When inventory is seasonal, consider using monthly averages or a rolling average across multiple periods to reduce volatility and better reflect typical turnover."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do FIFO, LIFO, or weighted-average valuation methods affect turnover?",
        "answer": "Inventory valuation affects both COGS and inventory balances and can materially change the turnover ratio. For cross-company comparisons, adjust or note differences in valuation policy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does a high or low turnover mean?",
        "answer": "High turnover generally indicates efficient inventory management and strong sales relative to inventory, but can also signal stockouts. Low turnover may indicate overstocking, obsolescence risk, or weak demand; evaluate alongside gross margin and working capital metrics."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I treat zero or negative average inventory?",
        "answer": "If average inventory is zero or negative, the turnover calculation is not meaningful. Investigate accounting treatments, timing, or errors. For zero inventory businesses (drop-shipping, service firms), alternative KPIs should be used."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I calculate inventory turnover?",
        "answer": "Calculate at a cadence that matches your business cycle—monthly for retail/fast-moving goods, quarterly or annually for longer-cycle inventory. Frequent monitoring helps detect trends and seasonality."
