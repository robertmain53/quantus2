    "introduction": [
      "Inventory turnover measures how many times a business sells and replaces inventory over a period. It is commonly expressed as a ratio: cost of goods sold divided by average inventory.",
      "Use this tool to calculate inventory turnover and the corresponding average days in inventory. Choose whether to supply a reported average inventory or compute it from beginning and ending balances.",
      "Results help assess inventory efficiency, identify slow-moving stock, and benchmark performance against industry standards. Interpret results in the context of your business model and seasonality."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formula: Inventory turnover = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory. Average inventory is commonly computed as (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2 when a period average is not supplied.",
      "Average days in inventory (also called days sales of inventory) = Period length (days) / Inventory turnover. Use period_days to match the timeframe for COGS (for example, 365 for annual, 90 for quarterly).",
      "This calculator offers two methods: direct average inventory input, or computed average from beginning and ending balances. Both methods are standard in financial analysis; choose the one that matches your accounting data.",
      "Be cautious when average inventory is zero or extremely small; division by near-zero can produce inflated ratios. For meaningful benchmarking, compare like-for-like periods and consider inventory valuation method (FIFO, LIFO, weighted average)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 (direct average): COGS = 1,200,000; Average inventory (reported) = 300,000; Turnover = 4.0; Days in inventory = 365 / 4.0 = 91.25 days.",
      "Example 2 (computed average): COGS = 500,000; Beginning inventory = 80,000; Ending inventory = 120,000; Average inventory = (80,000 + 120,000) / 2 = 100,000; Turnover = 5.0; Days in inventory = 365 / 5.0 = 73 days."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What inputs do I need?",
        "answer": "Provide cost of goods sold for the same period as inventory balances. Then either enter a reported average inventory or enter beginning and ending inventory to compute the average. Set the period length in days to match the timeframe for COGS."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method should I use: direct average or beginning/ending?",
        "answer": "Use a reported average inventory when your accounting system provides a period-weighted average. If not available, compute average as (beginning + ending) / 2 — a standard approach for many financial analyses."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I interpret the inventory turnover ratio?",
        "answer": "Higher turnover generally indicates faster sales or tighter inventory control; lower turnover can indicate overstocking or slow-moving items. Interpret in context of industry norms, product life cycle, and seasonality."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are common pitfalls and calibration checks?",
        "answer": "Ensure COGS and inventory are measured on the same valuation basis (same currency, same costing method). Watch for outliers caused by one-time write-offs, seasonal spikes, or misreported balances. Reconcile inventory accounts before analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this calculator handle multi-period or SKU-level analysis?",
        "answer": "This tool computes period-level ratios. For SKU-level or rolling averages, export transaction-level or periodic snapshots and run batch analysis or time-series calculations in a spreadsheet or analytics tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if average inventory is zero?",
        "answer": "A zero or near-zero average inventory will make the ratio undefined or extremely large. Investigate data accuracy, inventory accounting treatment, and consider adding a minimal floor for stability when running automated reports."
