    "introduction": [
      "Inventory turnover measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It helps assess operational efficiency and working capital use.",
      "This calculator uses cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by average inventory (the mean of beginning and ending inventory for the period). It also reports days in inventory (average days inventory is held), calculated as 365 divided by the turnover."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary formula: Inventory turnover = COGS / Average inventory, where Average inventory = (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2. This is the standard approach used in financial analysis and academic references.",
      "Days in inventory = 365 / Inventory turnover. For non-year periods, replace 365 with the number of days in the reporting period (for example, 90 for a quarter).",
      "When COGS is not available, some analysts substitute Net Sales in the numerator; that produces a different ratio (sales-based turnover) and should be interpreted accordingly. Use COGS for gross-margin–sensitive comparisons."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which inputs should I use?",
        "answer": "Use period-matching values: COGS for the same period as your beginning and ending inventory balances. If you only have a single average inventory figure calculated externally, you may compute average inventory separately and substitute it for (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does a high or low turnover mean?",
        "answer": "Higher turnover generally indicates faster sales or efficient inventory management; very high turnover can signal stockouts or insufficient safety stock. Lower turnover can indicate overstocking, obsolescence risk, or weak demand. Benchmarks vary by industry."
      },
      {
        "question": "What industry benchmarks should I use?",
        "answer": "Compare against industry peers and historical company performance. Government and industry sources (for example, Small Business Administration guidance and sector studies) provide sector-specific ratio ranges; always compare like periods (annual vs. quarterly) and inventory accounting methods."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I treat seasonal businesses?",
        "answer": "For seasonal operations use period-specific averages (e.g., rolling monthly averages or same-period prior-year values) to avoid misleading results from peak or trough inventory months."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if COGS or inventory is zero?",
        "answer": "A zero or near-zero denominator (average inventory) or numerator (COGS) will produce undefined or misleading results. Confirm data accuracy and use longer-period averages or rolling averages to smooth occasional zero values."
