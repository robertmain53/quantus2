1. This is a converter because the interface converts a single numeric amount in one currency (CAD) to a single numeric amount in another currency (USD) as a one-to-one user action (enter one value, get one value). Although exchange rates are time-varying, the UI behavior and input/output pattern match the converter component type.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown and no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, no canonical_url, no robots, no keywords, no schema_org objects beyond the allowed schema.additionalTypes, and no form for this converter).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
