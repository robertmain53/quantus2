1. This is an advanced_calc because the tool must support multiple related workflows (e.g., compute selling price from cost + markup percentage, compute markup percentage from cost + selling price, convert between markup and gross margin, and show gross profit), which requires conditional logic, multiple variables, and selectable methods rather than a single fixed-formula calculator.

2. I will use component_type: "advanced_calc" with logic.type: "advanced".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (for example "https://nist.gov/..."), with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no extra metadata like canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, no UI/layout keys, and I will not add a form object incompatible with converters).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
