    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length value in centimeters (cm) to millimeters (mm). The relationship between these SI-derived units is exact: one centimeter equals ten millimeters.",
      "Use this converter for quick unit changes when preparing measurements, drawings, specifications, or data entry. For regulated or safety-critical measurements, review calibration, traceability, and documented uncertainty before reporting values."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion relies on the International System of Units (SI) prefixes: centi- means one hundredth (10^-2) and milli- means one thousandth (10^-3). The conversion factor between centimeters and millimeters is fixed by those prefixes.",
      "While the mathematical conversion is exact (multiply by 10), reported results should reflect the measurement instrument’s resolution and calibrated accuracy. For engineering, manufacturing, or compliance work follow documented procedures and applicable standards for measurement uncertainty and calibration traceability."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: millimeters = centimeters × 10",
      "Step-by-step: take the numeric value in cm, multiply by 10, then round or format the result to the required number of significant digits based on measurement uncertainty or display requirements.",
      "Related conversion: 1 meter = 100 centimeters = 1000 millimeters, so meters can be converted to millimeters by multiplying by 1000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2.54 cm → 2.54 × 10 = 25.4 mm",
      "0 cm → 0 × 10 = 0 mm",
      "-3.2 cm → -3.2 × 10 = -32 mm (negative values are allowed and represent direction or offset)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship is exact: 1 cm equals 10 mm. Any non-exactness arises from measurement uncertainty, rounding, or numeric formatting, not from the conversion factor itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match the number of decimals or significant figures to the measurement instrument’s resolution and the declared uncertainty. For example, if a ruler is marked in millimeters, report to nearest millimeter unless further calibration supports more precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to worry about calibration or standards?",
        "answer": "Yes for regulated, safety-critical, or high-accuracy work. Ensure measurement tools are calibrated and traceable to national standards; follow the relevant ISO/NIST procedures for uncertainty reporting and calibration intervals."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert meters to millimeters here?",
        "answer": "This specific converter is for centimeters to millimeters. For meters to millimeters use the equivalent factor 1 m = 1000 mm or a dedicated meters-to-millimeters converter. The underlying principles of SI prefixes apply."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are negative values allowed?",
        "answer": "Yes. Negative values indicate direction or relative offsets and are processed the same way (multiply by 10)."
