    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a volume expressed in milliliters (mL) into liters (L). A milliliter is a common laboratory and everyday unit equal to one thousandth of a liter.",
      "The conversion is exact in mathematics, but when applying it to measured values you should account for instrument resolution, significant figures, and uncertainty. Guidance below references international measurement standards and practical calibration considerations.",
      "Use this tool for quick conversions, for documenting units in reports, or as a check when preparing solutions or dispensing fluids. For regulatory or safety-critical reporting, follow traceable calibration and reporting procedures described in the cited standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The relationship between milliliters and liters is defined by the International System of Units (SI): 1 L = 1000 mL. This is a fixed, linear scaling with no temperature dependence in the unit definition itself.",
      "When converting measured values, preserve and report measurement uncertainty and the number of significant figures supported by your instrument. For laboratory and regulated work, use calibrated equipment traceable to national metrology institutes and record calibration dates and uncertainty statements.",
      "This converter performs a pure mathematical scaling. For practical accuracy, combine the converted value with instrument-specific uncertainty, and consult the referenced standards for traceability and reporting formats."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: liters = milliliters ÷ 1000",
      "Step 1: Take the numeric volume in milliliters (mL). Step 2: Divide by 1000. Step 3: Report the result with appropriate significant figures and uncertainty.",
      "Example expression: 250 mL → 250 ÷ 1000 = 0.25 L. For measured 250 ± 1 mL, propagate uncertainty: ±1 mL ÷ 1000 = ±0.001 L."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1 mL to liters: 1 ÷ 1000 = 0.001 L",
      "Convert 250 mL to liters: 250 ÷ 1000 = 0.25 L",
      "Convert 1234 mL to liters: 1234 ÷ 1000 = 1.234 L"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Mathematically the conversion factor is exact: 1 L = 1000 mL. In practice, final reported values should reflect measurement uncertainty and instrument resolution."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the precision of the measurement instrument. For example, a 1 mL graduated cylinder suggests reporting to the nearest whole milliliter, then convert and show corresponding significant figures in liters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I propagate uncertainty when converting?",
        "answer": "Scale the absolute uncertainty by the same factor as the value. Example: 5 mL ± 0.1 mL → (5 ÷ 1000) L ± (0.1 ÷ 1000) L = 0.005 L ± 0.0001 L."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are temperature or pressure corrections needed?",
        "answer": "Unit conversion between mL and L is a pure numeric scaling and does not include thermodynamic corrections. However, if volumetric expansion of the liquid or container matters for precision work, apply temperature corrections separately using appropriate material properties and standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do for regulatory or traceable measurements?",
        "answer": "Use calibrated instruments with documented calibration certificates traceable to national metrology institutes, report uncertainty, and follow the reporting formats from relevant standards cited below."
