    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single numeric value in grams to pounds using the internationally recognized fixed relationship between the two units. It is intended for everyday tasks such as cooking, shipping estimates, lab notations, and quick engineering checks.",
      "The tool uses the defined equivalence between the units but does not replace calibrated measurement instruments. Read the accuracy notes and safety guidance before using converted values for regulated trade, medical dosing, or occupational safety limits."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is performed using the exact definition that one avoirdupois pound equals 453.59237 grams. This relationship is a fixed mathematical constant and is the basis for the conversion.",
      "Displayed results are rounded for readability. Internal numeric calculations follow standard floating point conventions; consult IEEE 754 for representation effects and NIST guidance for recommended presentation and calibration practices.",
      "For tasks requiring legal or medical accuracy, follow calibration and verification procedures in relevant standards and local regulations. Refer to national measurement authorities and occupational safety guidance for recordkeeping and tolerance requirements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 pound (lb) = 453.59237 grams (g).",
      "Primary formula: pounds = grams ÷ 453.59237.",
      "Rounding guidance: keep enough significant figures for your use case. For lab work use at least 4 to 6 significant figures; for everyday use 2 to 3 decimal places are typically sufficient. Be aware of floating point rounding when chaining calculations."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 grams → 100 ÷ 453.59237 = 0.220462262 lb (round to 0.22046 lb for 5 significant figures).",
      "5000 grams → 5000 ÷ 453.59237 = 11.0231131 lb (round to 11.023 lb for 6 significant figures).",
      "1 gram → 1 ÷ 453.59237 = 0.0022046226 lb (use caution with very small masses and instrument resolution)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical relationship used is exact because one pound is defined as exactly 453.59237 grams. Numerical results can appear approximate due to rounding and floating point representation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For trade and legal compliance follow local regulations. For laboratory calculations use at least 4 to 6 significant figures. For general use 2 to 3 decimal places are usually enough."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do two tools give slightly different answers?",
        "answer": "Differences typically come from display rounding, chosen number of significant figures, and floating point arithmetic. The underlying conversion constant is the same; differences are in formatting and intermediate rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for regulated weighing or dosing?",
        "answer": "This converter provides numerical conversions only. For regulated weighing, dosing, or trade you must use calibrated instruments and follow verification and documentation procedures specified by national standards and regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about different pound definitions?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the international avoirdupois pound defined as 453.59237 grams, which is the standard used in commerce and most technical contexts. Other historical pounds exist but are not used here."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or calibration recommendations?",
        "answer": "Yes. Calibrate scales regularly following manufacturer guidance and national metrology recommendations. For workplace safety consult relevant occupational safety rules before relying on converted values for exposure limits or hazardous materials handling."
