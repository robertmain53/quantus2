    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass given in grams (g) to avoirdupois pounds (lb). The conversion uses the internationally recognized definition of the avoirdupois pound relative to the kilogram, making the mathematical relationship exact.",
      "The converter is intended for general use including lab work, shipping calculations, recipe scaling, and workplace evaluations. For decisions that depend on legal, safety, or medical limits, verify measured values and instrument calibration before relying on converted results.",
      "Results are presented with configurable display precision; the underlying conversion factor is exact by definition, but measured input values have uncertainty that should be considered when reporting results."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is based on the fixed relationship that defines the avoirdupois pound in terms of the kilogram: 1 pound (lb) = 0.45359237 kilogram (kg). Since 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 1 lb = 453.59237 grams exactly.",
      "Because the factor 453.59237 g per lb is exact by definition, the mathematical conversion from grams to pounds is exact. Any loss of precision originates from input measurement uncertainty, numerical rounding, or display formatting.",
      "For traceability and calibration recommendations consult national metrology guidance and standards. Instruments and scales should be calibrated per national and international standards (for example NIST and ISO guidance). Consider workplace safety thresholds (OSHA) and numerical accuracy characteristics (IEEE floating-point considerations) when using converted values in regulated contexts."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: pounds = grams / 453.59237.",
      "Equivalent multiplier: pounds = grams × 0.0022046226218487757 (this multiplier is the exact reciprocal of 453.59237).",
      "Practical steps: record the measured mass in grams (including instrument uncertainty), apply the formula, then round the displayed result to a number of significant digits appropriate to the measurement uncertainty and use case."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 g → 100 / 453.59237 = 0.220462262 lb (round to 0.22046 lb for 5 decimal places).",
      "500 g → 500 / 453.59237 = 1.1023113109999999 lb (round to 1.10231 lb).",
      "1 g → 1 / 453.59237 = 0.002204622622 lb (commonly shown as 0.00220462 lb)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The avoirdupois pound is defined such that 1 lb = 0.45359237 kg exactly, and 1 kg = 1000 g exactly, so 1 lb = 453.59237 g is an exact definition. Any imprecision in results comes from the measured input and rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do results sometimes show rounding differences?",
        "answer": "Display rounding and numerical precision can produce visible differences. Use a number of decimal places that matches the measurement instrument's accuracy. For example, a kitchen scale with 1 g resolution does not justify showing 8 decimal places in pounds."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which pound is used here? Are there different pounds?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the international avoirdupois pound, which is standard for most everyday and commercial uses. Other historical systems (for example troy or apothecaries' pounds) are different and are not used here."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I account for measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "Report the measured value with its instrument uncertainty or resolution, then convert. Do not imply greater precision after conversion than existed in the original measurement. For traceable measurements follow calibration procedures per national metrology guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do workplace safety or legal limits change the conversion?",
        "answer": "No. The conversion itself is mathematical and unchanged, but when using converted values for compliance, safety, or legal purposes confirm that measurements, rounding, and calibrations meet the relevant regulatory or industry standard requirements (for example OSHA or applicable ISO standards)."
