    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a numeric length expressed in metres into its equivalent in centimetres using the exact SI relationship: 1 metre equals 100 centimetres. It is intended for quick calculations, data entry checks, learning, and lightweight engineering tasks.",
      "The mathematical conversion factor is exact. For calibrated measurements and regulatory use, users should account for instrument uncertainty, rounding rules, and laboratory traceability to national standards as described in the methodology and FAQ sections."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies a fixed mathematical relationship from the International System of Units (SI). The metre is the SI base unit of length and is currently defined in terms of the distance light travels in vacuum. The conversion factor between metres and centimetres is defined exactly: 1 metre = 100 centimetres.",
      "For reported measurements (for example, physical length measured with instruments), numerical conversion is exact but the measurement uncertainty is governed by the measuring device, calibration status, and applicable laboratory standards. For traceable calibration and uncertainty reporting follow ISO/IEC 17025 and national metrology guidance such as NIST publications."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: centimetres = metres × 100",
      "Step 1: Take the numeric value in metres (can be integer or decimal).",
      "Step 2: Multiply that value by 100 to obtain centimetres.",
      "Step 3: Apply desired rounding to the result (for display or reporting) and document measurement uncertainty separately when converting measured values."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 metre → 1 × 100 = 100 centimetres",
      "Example 2: 0.75 metre → 0.75 × 100 = 75 centimetres",
      "Example 3: 2.345 metre → 2.345 × 100 = 234.5 centimetres"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical factor is exact: 1 metre equals 100 centimetres. Any approximation or rounding comes from display choices or measurement uncertainty of real-world instruments."
      },
      {
        "question": "If I measured a length with a ruler, can I just convert and report the result?",
        "answer": "You can convert the numeric reading using this tool, but for formal reporting include the instrument resolution and calibration uncertainty. Follow ISO/IEC 17025 for lab calibration best practices and NIST guidance for SI usage when traceability is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results?",
        "answer": "Round according to the significant figures appropriate for your measurement or the required reporting standard. For exact arithmetic (pure numeric conversions) keep full precision and round only for presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool handle negative values or zero?",
        "answer": "Yes. The arithmetic rule applies to all real numbers: negative values and zero convert the same way. Negative lengths may be meaningful in some contexts (for example, offsets) but are not physical magnitudes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about unit definitions and traceability?",
        "answer": "Unit definitions come from the SI system. The metre is defined by the speed of light. For legal, safety, or calibration-critical work ensure measurements are traceable to a national metrology institute and that uncertainty is documented."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative standards and calibration guidance?",
        "answer": "See the citations below for NIST SI guidance, ISO standards on quantities and units, ISO/IEC 17025 for laboratory competence, and relevant IEEE work on measurement and instrumentation standards."
