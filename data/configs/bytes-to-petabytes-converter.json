    "introduction": [
      "Quickly convert a number of bytes into petabytes (PB). This converter uses the SI (decimal) petabyte by default, where 1 PB = 10^15 bytes. For clarity and accuracy it also explains the binary alternative (pebibyte, PiB), which is commonly used by operating systems and some technical contexts.",
      "Use the tool when comparing storage device capacities, reporting large datasets, or preparing technical documentation. If you must comply with a contract, vendor spec, or regulation, confirm whether the decimal (10^15) or binary (2^50) definition is required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This converter follows the SI convention for petabytes: 1 PB = 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (10^15). The binary alternative is the pebibyte (1 PiB = 2^50 bytes = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes). The distinction is documented by standards authorities and adopted by many technical organizations.",
      "When precision matters (e.g., billing, capacity planning, compliance), explicitly state which prefix is used. For file-system reporting and some operating systems, binary prefixes are often implied; for manufacturer specifications and most marketing materials, decimal SI prefixes are typical.",
      "Rounding and display precision: present results with enough significant digits for the audience (for technical reports show 6+ significant digits or use scientific notation; for summaries 2–3 decimal places are usually sufficient)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Decimal petabyte (PB): PB = bytes ÷ 1,000,000,000,000,000 (bytes / 10^15).",
      "Binary pebibyte (PiB): PiB = bytes ÷ 1,125,899,906,842,624 (bytes / 2^50).",
      "To convert PB back to bytes: bytes = PB × 1,000,000,000,000,000. To convert PiB back to bytes: bytes = PiB × 2^50."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes = 1 PB (decimal, 10^15).",
      "500,000,000,000,000 bytes ≈ 0.5 PB (decimal).",
      "1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes = 1 PiB (binary, 2^50) ≈ 1.1259 PB (decimal).",
      "450,000,000,000,000,000 bytes = 450 PB (decimal)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Default conversion uses SI decimal petabyte (1 PB = 10^15 bytes). If you need binary results, convert to pebibytes (PiB) using 2^50 bytes per PiB.",
      "Always note which definition you used when publishing numbers. Standards bodies (NIST/IEC) define and recommend binary prefixes (PiB, TiB) where power-of-two clarity is required."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which definition does this converter use by default — PB or PiB?",
        "answer": "By default this converter uses the SI decimal petabyte (PB): 1 PB = 10^15 bytes. The page explains the binary pebibyte (PiB = 2^50 bytes) as the alternate definition and provides the formula to convert to PiB if you need it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are there two different values (PB vs PiB)?",
        "answer": "Decimal prefixes (kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta) use powers of ten and are standard SI units. Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, pebi) use powers of two and avoid ambiguity in computing contexts. Standards organizations recommend binary prefixes when expressing powers-of-two quantities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which should I use for reporting capacity — the manufacturer PB or the filesystem value?",
        "answer": "Check the contract or reporting guidelines first. Manufacturers commonly use decimal PB (10^15). Filesystems and OS tools often report using binary units or report decimal values labeled as binary; always verify and document the definition used for consistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle rounding for large datasets or billing?",
        "answer": "For billing or formal reporting use the unit and rounding rule specified in the contract. If unspecified, state the chosen unit and rounding (for example, decimal PB rounded to three decimal places). For technical analysis retain more precision (scientific notation or at least 6 significant digits)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards references I can cite?",
        "answer": "Standards bodies such as NIST and IEC publish guidance and definitions for SI and binary prefixes. For compliance or procurement, follow the definitions specified in the governing standard or contract and reference the appropriate standards documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert petabytes to other units like terabytes or exabytes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the same base conversions: 1 PB = 1,000 TB (decimal). For binary equivalents, 1 PiB = 1,024 TiB. Ensure you apply the correct base (10 or 2) consistently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there any precision limit or measurement uncertainty I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion between bytes and PB/PiB is exact. Any uncertainty arises from measurement or reporting practices (e.g., whether disk manufacturers subtract firmware or reserve space). Always confirm how the original byte count was measured and whether any overhead was excluded."
