    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass given in grams (g) into long tons (the British/imperial long ton, sometimes called the long ton). The conversion uses the defined relationships between the gram, kilogram, and the long ton so results are traceable to SI-based definitions.",
      "Use this converter for quick unit conversions, pre-checking shipping totals, engineering estimates, or when converting datasets between metric small-unit measures and large imperial-ton units. For legal, trade, or custody-of-goods purposes, verify measured values against calibrated instruments and local regulatory requirements."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is performed by converting grams to kilograms (1 kilogram = 1000 grams) and then dividing by the mass of one long ton in kilograms. The long ton is defined as 2240 avoirdupois pounds and one pound is defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms, therefore 1 long ton = 2240 × 0.45359237 kg = 1016.0469088 kg.",
      "The numeric calculation in software uses IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic for performance and ubiquity; this introduces typical rounding behavior described in the IEEE 754 standard. For measurement and reporting, consider the uncertainty of the original measurement instrument and applicable calibration or accreditation standards such as NIST Handbook 44 and ISO/IEC 17025.",
      "For regulated or legal measurements consult relevant standards and local authorities. Recommended references include national metrology guidance and international standards for units and measurement practice to ensure traceability and compliance."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Convert grams to kilograms: kilograms = grams ÷ 1,000.",
      "Step 2: Convert kilograms to long tons: long_tons = kilograms ÷ 1,016.0469088 (since 1 long ton = 1016.0469088 kg).",
      "Combined formula: long_tons = grams ÷ 1,016,046.9088. Equivalently: long_tons = grams × 9.842065276422e-7 (approx).",
      "Example calculation shown compactly: 1000 g → 1.000 kg → 1.000 ÷ 1016.0469088 = 0.0009842065276 long tons."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 g = 0.0000009842065276 long tons (≈ 9.8421 × 10^-7)",
      "1,000 g (1 kg) = 0.0009842065276 long tons",
      "1,000,000 g (1000 kg) = 0.9842065276 long tons",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The relationship 1 long ton = 2240 lb and 1 lb = 0.45359237 kg makes 1 long ton = 1016.0469088 kg exact by definition. Converting grams to long tons using that value is therefore exact in mathematical terms, but displayed results are subject to rounding and to the measurement uncertainty of the original gram value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a long ton, a short ton, and a tonne?",
        "answer": "A long ton (imperial) = 2240 lb = 1016.0469088 kg. A short ton (US) = 2000 lb = 907.18474 kg. A metric tonne (tonne) = 1000 kg. Choose the unit that matches your regional or contractual requirement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places based on the magnitude and required precision. For very small converted values (e.g., single grams to long tons) show scientific notation or 6–9 significant figures if preserving precision. For reporting totals, round to a precision supported by measurement uncertainty and regulatory tolerances."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there calibration or compliance considerations?",
        "answer": "Yes. For legal-for-trade or laboratory work, use calibrated scales traceable to national standards and follow calibration/accreditation practices such as those in NIST Handbook 44 and ISO/IEC 17025. The numeric conversion itself does not replace instrument calibration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can floating-point rounding change results?",
        "answer": "Yes. Software typically uses IEEE 754 binary floating-point arithmetic which can introduce rounding at the least significant bits. For critical applications, use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or represent values in integers (e.g., grams) during intermediate calculations and apply controlled rounding at final reporting."
