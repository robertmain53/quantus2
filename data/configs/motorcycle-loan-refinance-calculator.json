      "This calculator helps you compare your existing motorcycle loan to a proposed refinance and provides an approximate view of how switching to bi‑weekly payments (splitting a monthly payment in half every two weeks) changes annual cash flow. It reports periodic payments, total payment cost, and straightforward savings estimates.",
      "Results are approximations intended to help you decide whether to investigate a refinance with your lender. Use the values as planning guidance and confirm exact payoff schedules, prepayment penalties and fees with your loan servicer before acting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Periodic payment calculations use a standard amortizing loan formula where periodic interest rate = annual rate / payments per year, and payment = r*P / (1-(1+r)^-n). For numerical stability and predictable rounding we follow IEEE floating point conventions and design to minimize catastrophic cancellation in intermediate steps.",
      "Model limitations and quality controls reference ISO quality management principles for repeatable calculations and record keeping, and we operate with an accuracy disclaimer consistent with best practices for consumer tools. For digital security and data handling we reference NIST guidance on integrity and authentication; the tool itself does not store personal data beyond a single session.",
      "Bi‑weekly impact is provided as an approximation showing extra annual paid amount when splitting monthly payments into bi‑weekly halves (26 half‑payments per year). Exact interest and payoff time effects require a full per‑period amortization schedule that accounts for payment dates, compounding conventions, and any lender rounding rules."

      "Example 1: Remaining principal $8,000, current rate 6% with 3 years left (monthly). Refinance to 5% for 3 years with $200 fees. The tool shows current vs refinance periodic payments, total cost difference and annualized savings.",
      "Example 2: If you split your monthly payment into bi‑weekly halves, the tool reports the extra annual amount paid due to the 26 half‑payments per year. That extra annual payment accelerates principal reduction and shortens payoff, but exact months saved should be computed from a full amortization schedule."

        "question": "Does the calculator include taxes, registration, or insurance?",
        "answer": "No. This tool compares loan principal and interest only. Do not include taxes, registration, insurance, or other ownership costs in the loan comparison."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I model extra payments or early payoff?",
        "answer": "You can enter an extra payment per period in the form. This estimator shows periodic payment and simple totals; for precise payoff dates and interest saved with extra payments, request a detailed amortization schedule from your lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are results guaranteed to match what a lender provides?",
        "answer": "No. Lenders may use different compounding, rounding, payment application order, payment dates, and may impose fees or prepayment penalties. Consider this an estimate and obtain official payoff figures from your current servicer and any prospective lender."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the bi‑weekly estimate look like an extra payment per year?",
        "answer": "Paying half your monthly payment every two weeks results in 26 half‑payments, which equals 13 full monthly payments per year instead of 12. That additional full payment accelerates principal reduction and reduces interest, but exact amortization effects depend on timing and lender rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if interest rate is zero or extremely small?",
        "answer": "The calculator requires a small positive rate for numerical stability. For zero‑interest loans, periodic payment equals principal divided by number of periods; consult your lender for specific payoff instructions."
