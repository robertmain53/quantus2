    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a time quantity expressed in seconds (s) into milliseconds (ms). The relationship is a fixed SI-based scaling factor: 1 second equals 1,000 milliseconds.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversions, code verification, test data preparation, logging timestamp normalization, and documentation. For mission-critical systems, follow the accuracy and traceability guidance in the methodology and citations below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a deterministic scaling between two SI-compatible units. By definition, 1 second = 1,000 milliseconds, so conversion is multiplication by 1,000. This is consistent with SI definitions and national metrology guidance.",
      "When using converted values in engineering, measurement, or regulatory contexts, ensure numeric precision and provenance meet your application requirements. For real-time synchronization and traceable timestamps, align system clocks to recognized time standards and protocols.",
      "Accuracy considerations: account for floating-point representation, required decimal places, and any downstream sampling or quantization. For networked time synchronization, consider standards and protocols such as those published by national metrology institutes and by relevant IEEE working groups."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply seconds by 1,000 to get milliseconds.",
      "Formula: milliseconds = seconds × 1000",
      "Reverse: seconds = milliseconds ÷ 1000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "2 seconds → 2 × 1000 = 2000 milliseconds",
      "0.005 seconds → 0.005 × 1000 = 5 milliseconds",
      "123.456 seconds → 123.456 × 1000 = 123456 milliseconds"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship 1 s = 1000 ms is exact by definition. Practical numeric results can be subject to floating-point rounding when represented in software or limited-precision hardware."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I keep?",
        "answer": "Keep as many decimal places as required by your application. For human-readable durations, milliseconds are typically shown as integers. For high-precision measurement, preserve sufficient digits and document the rounding method (round-half-even, truncate, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative or very large time values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Negative values convert normally (e.g., -1 s = -1000 ms). For extremely large values, watch for overflow in fixed-width integer types; use 64-bit integers or floating-point types with appropriate range for large durations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle timestamps and synchronization?",
        "answer": "For timestamps and synchronization, use standard time protocols (NTP, PTP) and align to reference clocks traceable to national standards. Converting display units does not replace the need for proper time synchronization and calibration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or standards considerations?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use SI unit conventions and follow applicable standards and workplace safety rules when time measurement affects safety, compliance, or reporting. See the citations for authoritative sources."
