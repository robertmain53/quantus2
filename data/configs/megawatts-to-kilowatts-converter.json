    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms power measurements from Megawatts to Kilowatts, enabling detailed analysis of utility-scale power generation.",
      "Megawatts describe power plants and renewable facilities, while kilowatts represent distribution and consumption. This conversion bridges generation and consumption scales.",
      "This converter uses the precise relationship where 1 megawatt equals exactly 1,000 Kilowatts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 MW = 1,000 kW. To convert megawatts to kilowatts, multiply by 1,000. For example, 1 MW = 1,000 kW, 50 MW = 50,000 kW, 500 MW = 500,000 kW.",
      "Power grid operators track generation in megawatts but control distribution in kilowatts. Converting enables system operation understanding.",
      "Utility-scale projects specify capacity in megawatts for planning, but billing and consumption analysis uses kilowatts. Converting enables detailed analysis.",
      "This converter provides precise power conversions for grid analysis and energy planning."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Utility capacity: A 1,000 MW power plant provides 1,000,000 kW to the grid, essential for regional capacity planning.",
      "Example 2 – Renewable expansion: Adding 100 MW of solar provides 100,000 kW additional capacity, important for renewable integration planning.",
      "Example 3 – Peak demand: A region with 5,000 MW demand requires 5,000,000 kW of generation capacity during peak hours."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion from Megawatts to Kilowatts?",
        "answer": "1 MW = 1,000 kW. Multiply megawatts by 1,000 to get kilowatts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use both megawatts and kilowatts?",
        "answer": "Megawatts simplify large system discussion; kilowatts provide practical numbers for distribution and consumption."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are megawatts and kilowatts used in the power grid?",
        "answer": "Generation plants report in megawatts; transmission lines operate in megawatts; distribution substations step down to kilowatts; households consume in kilowatts."
