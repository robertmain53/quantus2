    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs direct unit conversion between megawatts (MW) and kilowatts (kW). The relationship is a fixed SI prefix conversion: 1 megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts, so the numerical conversion is exact and deterministic.",
      "The tool is intended for engineers, technicians, energy analysts, and anyone needing a quick and reliable unit conversion. For measured power values, apply this conversion to the instrument reading; consult calibration and uncertainty documentation when using converted readings for regulatory compliance or contractual reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the International System of Units (SI) prefix kilo- (k) = 10^3. Megawatt (MW) is the SI-derived unit with prefix mega- (M) = 10^6 applied to the watt (W). Converting between these units is therefore a scalar multiplication or division by 1,000.",
      "While the mathematical conversion is exact, practical accuracy depends on source measurements and instrumentation. Follow NIST guidance for unit definitions and traceability, use IEEE and ISO standards for instrument calibration and power measurement methods, and observe OSHA requirements for safe measurement around high-voltage or high-power equipment.",
      "When converting values for reporting, clarify whether the value represents instantaneous power, average power over an interval, or energy (e.g., MWh). Rounding should respect the significant digits of the original measurement and any contractual or regulatory precision requirements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "To convert megawatts to kilowatts: kW = MW × 1,000",
      "To convert kilowatts to megawatts: MW = kW ÷ 1,000",
      "Example calculation steps: take the measured or stated value in MW, multiply by 1,000 to obtain kW. No additional correction factors are applied by this converter."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 MW = 1,000 kW",
      "0.5 MW = 500 kW",
      "2.75 MW = 2,750 kW",
      "1500 MW = 1,500,000 kW"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion from MW to kW exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The unit conversion factor is exact because it is defined by SI prefixes: 1 MW equals exactly 1,000 kW. Any deviation in reported values comes from measurement uncertainty, not the conversion itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between MW and MWh?",
        "answer": "MW (megawatt) is a unit of power (rate of energy transfer). MWh (megawatt-hour) is a unit of energy (power multiplied by time). Converting MW to kW converts power units; converting to MWh requires integrating power over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep when converting?",
        "answer": "Keep at least the same number of significant figures as the original measurement. For regulatory or contract reporting, follow the precision rules in the applicable standard or agreement. Rounding before any subsequent calculations can introduce avoidable error."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for instrument calibration or measurement uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a mathematical unit conversion only. For calibrated measurements and uncertainty estimation, consult measurement standards and calibration certificates referenced by NIST, ISO, and IEEE, and apply uncertainty propagation as appropriate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for grid interconnection or safety calculations?",
        "answer": "You may use the numeric conversion, but for interconnection studies, protection settings, or safety planning, follow the applicable IEEE/IEC standards and OSHA regulations. Those contexts often require specific measurement procedures, rounding conventions, and documented calibration traceability."
