1. This is a converter because converting square feet to square meters is a fixed mathematical relationship between two units, requires one numeric input and produces one numeric output, and does not need additional variables or intermediate form fields.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays if included).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, with no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, form for converters, or any other disallowed fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
