    "introduction": [
      "This converter changes a gross margin percentage into the corresponding markup percentage. Gross margin is expressed as profit divided by selling price; markup is expressed as profit divided by cost. Many pricing and accounting workflows require converting between these two views to set prices correctly or compare benchmarks.",
      "Use a single margin input (as a percent). The tool validates inputs, warns about out-of-range values, and indicates when the conversion is undefined (for example when margin is 100%). Typical use cases include retail pricing, bid preparation, and margin reconciliation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the algebraic relationship between margin (profit / selling price) and markup (profit / cost). The conversion is deterministic and exact for valid numeric inputs under standard arithmetic.",
      "To ensure trustworthy results we recommend validating input formatting (percent vs decimal), limiting inputs to realistic ranges, and rounding outputs to a sensible number of decimal places for your reporting practice. For professional use, follow organizational controls and versioning for pricing policies in line with quality-management and information-security guidance.",
      "Accuracy and testing recommendations: verify the converter with known cases, include unit tests for boundary conditions (0%, 50%, 99.99%), and document the rounding rules. For controls and auditing, follow guidance from NIST SP 800-series for secure computation logging, ISO 9001 for quality management of business processes, IEEE numeric best-practices for floating point handling, and OSHA guidance where pricing impacts safety-related procurement processes."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Notation: let margin be expressed as a percent (for example 40 for 40%). Convert to decimal: M = margin% / 100.",
      "Formula (decimal): markup_decimal = M / (1 - M). Convert back to percent: markup% = markup_decimal * 100.",
      "Compact percent formula: markup% = (margin% / (100 - margin%)) * 100.",
      "Validation rules: margin% must not be equal to or exceed 100. If margin% = 100 the denominator becomes zero and markup is undefined (infinite). Negative margins produce negative markup values; treat these as losses rather than standard price increases."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: margin = 40%. M = 0.40, markup_decimal = 0.40 / (1 - 0.40) = 0.6667, markup% = 66.67%. So a 40% margin equals a 66.67% markup on cost.",
      "Example 2: margin = 25%. M = 0.25, markup_decimal = 0.25 / 0.75 = 0.3333, markup% = 33.33%."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between margin and markup?",
        "answer": "Margin measures profit as a share of selling price. Markup measures profit as a share of cost. The two look different numerically; converting between them requires the formulas shown above."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert a margin above 100%?",
        "answer": "No. A margin of 100% means profit equals selling price and implies cost is zero; the markup formula divides by (1 - margin) and thus is undefined when margin% = 100. Values above 100% are not valid for standard margin definitions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What rounding or precision should I use?",
        "answer": "Round to a number of decimal places that matches your reporting needs. For price-setting, two decimal places or rounding to the nearest 0.01% is common. Document the rounding rule for auditability and include unit tests for edge cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are negative margins allowed?",
        "answer": "Yes, a negative margin indicates a loss on the selling price and will produce a negative markup. Treat such results as indicators of unprofitable pricing rather than meaningful markup strategies."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I validate inputs for automated workflows?",
        "answer": "Validate that the input is numeric, interpret percent vs decimal consistently, and enforce 0 <= margin% < 100 for typical conversions. Log invalid attempts and follow organizational change-control procedures for any converter updates."
