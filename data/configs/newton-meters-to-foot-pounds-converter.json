    "introduction": [
      "This torque converter lets you switch instantly between newton-meters (N·m) and foot-pounds force (ft·lbf), the two most common torque units in engineering, automotive work, and equipment maintenance.",
      "Use it whenever a service manual, torque wrench, or fastener specification is written in one system and your tools or data sheets use the other. The conversion factors are based on SI recommendations and high-precision unit tables so you can rely on consistent, repeatable results.",
      "If you also need to think about lever arm lengths when visualizing torque, you can pair this tool with basic length converters such as meters-to-feet or feet-to-meters to keep all dimensions in the same system while you work."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Torque (often denoted by the Greek letter tau) is defined as the product of a force and its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation. In symbols, torque = force × lever arm. In the International System of Units (SI), torque is measured in newton-metres (N·m), which is explicitly identified by NIST and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures as the coherent SI unit for moment of force rather than the joule.",
      "In many engineering and automotive contexts that use Imperial or US customary units, torque is expressed in foot-pounds force (ft·lbf). This unit represents one pound-force applied at the end of a one-foot lever arm. Although torque and energy share the same dimensions in base SI units, reference standards emphasize that the joule should not be used to express torque in technical work; the distinct unit names help avoid confusion between rotational effect and scalar energy.",
      "The exact relationship between newton-metres and foot-pounds force comes from two underlying conversions: between newtons and pound-force, and between metres and feet. Using high-accuracy factors from NIST-aligned tables, one newton is approximately 0.224809 pound-force and one metre is approximately 3.28084 feet. Combining these gives a widely accepted factor of about 0.7375621 foot-pounds force per newton-metre, and the inverse factor of about 1.355818 newton-metres per foot-pound force.",
      "This converter applies the standard N·m to ft·lbf factor and its inverse under the hood so that you only need to enter the torque value once. For day-to-day workshop use (for example, tightening wheel nuts or bicycle components), rounding to one decimal place in foot-pounds is usually more than sufficient because typical click-type torque wrenches have uncertainties of around a few percent. For laboratory, calibration, or design work, you may want to retain two or three decimal places but should always match the resolution and uncertainty of your instruments.",
      "When working from manufacturer specifications, always treat the original torque unit and any stated tolerance as authoritative. Use this converter to translate those values into the units your tools display, then set your torque wrench or dynamometer accordingly. If there is any conflict between a converted value and a documented torque table issued by the equipment manufacturer or a recognized standards body, follow the official documentation and use this tool as a supporting aid rather than a substitute."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is torque, and why do engineers use newton-metres and foot-pounds?",
        "answer": "Torque is a measure of the rotational effect of a force applied at a distance from an axis, defined as force multiplied by lever arm length. In SI, the standard unit is the newton-metre (N·m), explicitly identified in international standards as the coherent SI unit for moment of force. In Imperial and US customary systems, torque is commonly expressed in foot-pounds force (ft·lbf), meaning one pound-force applied at a one-foot lever arm. Engineers use both units depending on the design tradition of the equipment and the region where tools and specifications originated."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between newton-metres and foot-pounds?",
        "answer": "Using high-precision conversion factors for force and length, most engineering references give 1 N·m ≈ 0.7375621 ft·lbf and 1 ft·lbf ≈ 1.355818 N·m. These values are derived from NIST-aligned tables and are accurate for professional engineering, automotive, and maintenance work. This converter uses the same standard factors so that a torque specified in one unit can be translated consistently into the other."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is ft-lb the same as lb-ft when talking about torque?",
        "answer": "In practice, ft-lb and lb-ft are both commonly used to describe torque and refer to the same unit: foot-pounds force. Strictly speaking, writing ft·lbf makes it clear that this is pound-force acting at a distance of one foot, but many tool markings and manuals use ft-lb or lb-ft interchangeably. The important thing is that the context is torque, not linear force per unit length, and that you interpret values consistently with the manufacturer's documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why not use joules instead of newton-metres for torque?",
        "answer": "Torque and energy share the same combination of base units in the SI system, so one joule is dimensionally equivalent to one newton-metre. However, international standards and NIST guidance specify that the joule is reserved for energy and work, while the newton-metre is reserved for torque or moment of force. Using distinct unit names helps prevent confusion between a rotational tendency (torque) and scalar energy or work in technical documents and safety-critical procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places do I really need when converting torque?",
        "answer": "For typical workshop and automotive use, one decimal place in foot-pounds or newton-metres is usually sufficient, because most hand torque wrenches have uncertainties on the order of a few percent. Keeping three or four decimals in a conversion does not increase real-world accuracy if your tool cannot resolve differences that small. For calibration labs or design calculations, you may work with more significant figures, but you should always align your rounding with the accuracy of your instruments and the precision stated in the original specification."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I safely use this converter for critical fasteners on vehicles or machinery?",
        "answer": "Yes, this converter uses standard, reference-grade factors for N·m to ft·lbf conversion, consistent with published unit tables used in engineering practice. For critical fasteners, always start from the torque specified by the vehicle or equipment manufacturer, pay attention to any stated tolerance or tightening sequence, and then use this tool only to translate values into the units shown on your torque wrench or measuring device. Periodic calibration of your torque tools remains essential for safety-critical applications."
