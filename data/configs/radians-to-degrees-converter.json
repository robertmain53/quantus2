      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms mathematical radian angles to familiar degrees for easy interpretation.",
        "Radians are standard in mathematics but degrees are more intuitive for everyday angles.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where π radians equals 180 degrees."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "π radians = 180°. To convert radians to degrees: multiply by 180/π.",
        "Radians are natural for calculus but degrees help visualize angles practically.",
        "Understanding radian-to-degree conversion bridges mathematical and practical understanding.",
        "This converter provides precise angle conversion for practical interpretation."

      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Right angle: π/2 radians ≈ 1.571 rad = 90°.",
        "Example 2 – Full rotation: 2π radians ≈ 6.283 rad = 360°.",

        {
          "question": "Why do physicists use radians?",
          "answer": "Radians simplify physics equations. Angular velocity = velocity/radius, only works with radians."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is π radians really exactly 180°?",
          "answer": "Yes, by definition. Radian: angle with arc length = radius. Semicircle: arc = πr, angle = π rad."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the easiest way to remember conversion?",
          "answer": "Flash cards: π ≈ 3.14 rad = 180°. 2π ≈ 6.28 rad = 360°. π/2 ≈ 1.57 rad = 90°."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do sine and cosine work in radians?",
          "answer": "Sin(π/6) = 0.5, cos(π/4) = 0.707. Same trig ratios, angles just expressed differently."

        {
          "question": "What's a common mistake with radians?",

        {
          "question": "Do all programming languages use radians?",
          "answer": "Yes. Java, Python, C, JavaScript all use radians in Math.sin(), math.sin(), etc."

          "question": "What is a milliradian?",

        {
          "question": "How do I convert between degree minutes seconds?",
          "answer": "First convert DMS to decimal degrees, then use degrees to radians conversion."
