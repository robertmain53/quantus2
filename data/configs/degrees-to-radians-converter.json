        "This converter transforms angles from degrees (familiar units) to radians (mathematical standard).",
        "Radians are the standard angle unit in mathematics and physics calculations.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 180 degrees equals π radians."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 radian = 180/π degrees ≈ 57.296 degrees. To convert degrees to radians: multiply by π/180.",
        "Radians are dimensionless, based on arc length. Degrees are arbitrary 360-based divisions.",
        "Scientific and engineering calculations require radians for trigonometric functions.",
        "This converter provides precise angle conversion for mathematical work."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Right angle: 90° = π/2 radians ≈ 1.571 radians.",
        "Example 2 – Full circle: 360° = 2π radians ≈ 6.283 radians.",
        "Example 3 – Common angle: 45° = π/4 radians ≈ 0.785 radians."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "Why use radians instead of degrees?",

        {
          "question": "What is a radian?",
          "answer": "Angle where arc length equals radius. More natural than arbitrary 360° system."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I remember the conversion?",
          "answer": "π radians = 180°. Divide/multiply: degrees × π/180 = radians. Radians × 180/π = degrees."
        },
        {
          "question": "When should I use degrees vs radians?",

        {
          "question": "What is the radian measure of 1 degree?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Why is 180° exactly π radians?",
          "answer": "Radian definition: arc length = radius. Semicircle: arc = πr. So 180° = π radians."

          "answer": "Angle approaching zero. In radians, sin(θ) ≈ θ for small θ, enabling approximations."
