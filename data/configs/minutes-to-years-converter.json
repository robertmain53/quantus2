    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns a value expressed in minutes into years. Because the word \"year\" can mean several slightly different time intervals, the tool supports and documents the three most common definitions: a simple 365-day year, the Gregorian average year (365.2425 days), and the astronomical Julian year (365.25 days).",
      "The conversion uses seconds as the base SI time unit and provides guidance on when small numeric differences matter, how rounding and floating-point behavior affect results, and which definition is appropriate for common use cases such as rough planning, legal or payroll calculations, and scientific work."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "All conversions are derived from the International System of Units (SI) base unit for time, the second. A minute is treated as exactly 60 seconds. Years are provided using three clearly named conventions so users can select the one appropriate for their needs.",
      "For accuracy and reproducibility we reference internationally recognized standards and practices for units and numeric computation. Where numeric precision matters, use the Gregorian average year for civil date averages, the 365-day convention for simple accounting or approximate planning, and the Julian astronomical year for certain scientific contexts. For extreme precision or very large numbers, users should use arbitrary-precision arithmetic and be aware of floating-point rounding behaviors described by IEEE 754."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Base definitions used by this converter: 1 minute = 60 seconds.",
      "Common year definitions used by this tool: 365-day year (365 days exactly), Gregorian average year (365.2425 days), Julian year (365.25 days).",
      "Conversion formulas from minutes to years:",
      "Years (365-day) = minutes / (60 x 24 x 365)",
      "Years (Gregorian average) = minutes / (60 x 24 x 365.2425)",
      "Years (Julian astronomical) = minutes / (60 x 24 x 365.25)",
      "To convert back: minutes = years x 60 x 24 x daysPerYear (using the same daysPerYear definition)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 525600 minutes equals 1.000000 years using the 365-day definition because 525600 / (60 * 24 * 365) = 1.",
      "Example 2: 525600 minutes equals approximately 0.999315 years using the Gregorian average: 525600 / (60 * 24 * 365.2425) ≈ 0.999315.",
      "Example 3: 1,000,000 minutes equals approximately 1.9013 years (365-day): 1000000 / (60 * 24 * 365) ≈ 1.9013."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use the 365-day option for simple, easy-to-understand calculations where leap years and fractional-day averages are not required.",
      "Use the Gregorian average (365.2425) for civil, legal, and payroll calculations that require average-year accuracy over long spans.",
      "Use the Julian year (365.25) only when a specific astronomical convention requires it. For scientific tasks that demand the highest time precision, consult domain-specific timekeeping resources and use high-precision arithmetic."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which \"year\" should I pick for payroll or age calculations?",
        "answer": "For payroll, age, and most civil purposes use the Gregorian average year (365.2425 days) or directly compute using calendar-aware date arithmetic. The Gregorian average gives a correct long-term average; however for exact age in years between two calendar dates, use calendar date difference rather than a pure minutes-to-years conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the numeric difference between the common year definitions?",
        "answer": "Differences are small but cumulative. A 365-day year differs from the Gregorian average by about 0.2425 days per year (≈350 minutes per year). Over decades the difference becomes noticeable, so pick the definition that matches your use case."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The mathematical formulas above are exact for the chosen year definition. Practical numeric results may be subject to floating-point rounding. For critical or regulatory calculations, report required precision and consider using arbitrary-precision arithmetic; see IEEE 754 guidance for floating-point behavior."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For high-level planning 2–4 decimal places are usually sufficient. For scientific or legal reporting follow the precision rules of your governing standards or organization. If you require machine-readable exactness, work in seconds or minutes as integers and convert with documented rounding rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from years to minutes?",
        "answer": "Yes. Multiply years by 60 * 24 * daysPerYear using the same year definition used to calculate the years originally to avoid inconsistency."
