    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms length measurements from Feet to Kilometers, bridging imperial and metric scales.",
      "Very large distances in feet often need conversion to kilometers for metric understanding.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 kilometer equals exactly 3,280.84 feet."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 km = 3,280.84 feet. To convert feet to kilometers, divide by 3,280.84. For example, 3,280.84 feet = 1 km, 32,808.4 feet = 10 km.",
      "Altitude, elevation, and large distances are measured in feet in the US but kilometers internationally.",
      "Understanding conversion helps with sports, aviation, and geographical distance comparisons.",
      "This converter provides precise length conversions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Altitude: Mount Everest is 29,032 feet ≈ 8.85 kilometers.",
      "Example 2 – Aviation: A cruise altitude of 35,000 feet ≈ 10.67 kilometers.",
      "Example 3 – Distance: A 1-mile run is 5,280 feet ≈ 1.61 kilometers."
