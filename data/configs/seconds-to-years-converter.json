    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a single input value expressed in seconds into the equivalent number of years. The calculator uses the internationally recognised SI second as the base time unit and expresses results according to a chosen reference year length.",
      "Because the length of a \"year\" can be defined in several valid ways (calendar year, average Gregorian year, Julian year, or an exact 365-day year), this page explains the default choice, the commonly used alternatives, and the accuracy implications for different use cases."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Base unit: the second is the SI base unit for time. For traceability and high-precision work follow the SI second definition as maintained by national metrology institutes.",
      "Reference year: this converter uses the average Gregorian calendar year (365.2425 days = 31,556,952 seconds) as the default reference for a civil year. This average accounts for leap years in the Gregorian calendar and is appropriate for most civil and planning purposes.",
      "Alternative definitions: the Julian year (365.25 days = 31,557,600 seconds) and the exact 365-day year (31,536,000 seconds) are provided as documented alternatives because some scientific fields and legacy systems use those conventions. For high-precision timing (sub-second per year), account for leap seconds and use specialized timekeeping standards and protocols."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: choose a reference year length in seconds. Default (civil average Gregorian year) = 31,556,952 seconds.",
      "Step 2: divide the input seconds by the chosen year length in seconds to obtain years.",
      "Formula (default): years = seconds / 31,556,952",
      "Common alternative formulas: years (Julian) = seconds / 31,557,600; years (365-day) = seconds / 31,536,000"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1,000,000,000 seconds ≈ 31.6880878 years (using default Gregorian mean year: 1,000,000,000 / 31,556,952 ≈ 31.688088).",
      "31,557,600 seconds = 1.000008 years (Julian year reference).",
      "31,536,000 seconds = 1.000000 years (exact 365-day year reference)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which definition of year does this converter use by default?",
        "answer": "By default it uses the average Gregorian calendar year (365.2425 days = 31,556,952 seconds), which aligns with civil calendar conventions and is suitable for most planning and reporting tasks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are there different answers for the same number of seconds?",
        "answer": "Different fields use different year definitions (calendar average, Julian, exact 365-day). Each definition yields a slightly different seconds-per-year value; pick the definition that matches your context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do leap seconds affect the conversion?",
        "answer": "Leap seconds alter the relationship between UTC and astronomical time scales. For conversions intended for civil timescales over years, using an average year length is acceptable. For high-precision timekeeping (e.g., synchronization, timestamps, or metrology) account for leap seconds and use standards and protocols designed for that purpose."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise is the result?",
        "answer": "The mathematical division is exact to the precision of your input and display. Practical accuracy depends on the chosen year definition and whether leap seconds or relativistic/time-scale corrections are relevant to your use case."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert back from years to seconds?",
        "answer": "Yes. Multiply the number of years by the same reference year length in seconds that you used for the forward conversion."
