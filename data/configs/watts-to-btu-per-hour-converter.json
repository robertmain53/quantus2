    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a power value expressed in kilowatts (kW) to British Thermal Units per hour (BTU/h). It is designed for quick, engineering‑grade conversions used in HVAC sizing, energy reporting, and equipment specification.",
      "The tool uses internationally recognized unit definitions to produce a clear numeric result and includes guidance on precision, applicable variants of the BTU definition, and how to interpret results in safety or regulatory contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a fixed mathematical relation based on SI and accepted energy units: 1 watt equals 1 joule per second, and the BTU is defined in joules per the international reference. The converter multiplies the input in kilowatts by the exact conversion factor to yield BTU per hour.",
      "Results are presented as a numerical conversion only. Users who require traceable metrology for legal or calibration purposes should use calibrated instruments and reference the primary standards from national measurement institutes and standards organizations listed below."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Start from definitions: 1 W = 1 J/s. 1 kW = 1,000 W.",
      "1 BTU (international table) = 1,055.05585262 J. Therefore 1 W = 3600 J/h = 3600 / 1,055.05585262 BTU/h = 3.4121416326739 BTU/h.",
      "Simplified conversion used: BTU/h = kW × 3412.1416326739. For many practical applications this is rounded to 3412.142 BTU/h; choose rounding based on required precision."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1.0 kW → 1.0 × 3412.1416326739 = 3412.1416326739 BTU/h (rounded 3412.142 BTU/h).",
      "Example 2: 5.5 kW → 5.5 × 3412.1416326739 ≈ 18,766.779979706 BTU/h (rounded 18,766.78 BTU/h)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which conversion factor does this tool use?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the international table definition of the BTU (1 BTU = 1,055.05585262 J) and the SI definition of the watt. The exact factor implemented is 1 kW = 3412.1416326739 BTU/h, with common rounding to 3412.142 for display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there different BTU definitions and does that affect results?",
        "answer": "Yes. There are historical and regional BTU variants (for example thermochemical). The international table BTU is the standard used here. If you require a specific historic or industry variant, adjust the factor or consult a standards reference."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I use for engineering work?",
        "answer": "For equipment sizing in HVAC and mechanical engineering, 3 to 5 significant digits are commonly sufficient. For metrology, calibration, or legal reporting, follow the precision and uncertainty guidelines from national measurement institutes and document uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion appropriate for energy vs power calculations?",
        "answer": "This converter translates instantaneous power (kW) to a power rate in BTU per hour (BTU/h). It does not compute energy over time (e.g., kWh to BTU) unless you supply an average power and multiply by time separately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to consider regulatory or safety standards when using results?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use results within the context of relevant safety and performance standards for your industry. For example, electrical equipment, heating systems, and workplace safety may be subject to national or international standards and regulations. Consult the standards bodies listed in the citations."
