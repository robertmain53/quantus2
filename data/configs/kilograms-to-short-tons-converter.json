    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a mass expressed in kilograms (kg) to US short tons (also written as short tons or ton (short)). A short ton equals 2,000 pounds and is commonly used in the United States for freight, commodities, and industrial weights.",
      "The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship and is suitable for engineering estimates, shipping calculations, inventory management, and unit reconciliation between metric and US customary systems. Use higher precision for scientific or legal measurements and follow calibration and regulatory requirements where applicable."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the exact relationship between kilogram and pound, and the definition of the US short ton as 2,000 pounds. Numerically, 1 kilogram = 2.2046226218487757 pounds, and 1 short ton = 2000 pounds, so the conversion factor is derived from these definitions.",
      "We recommend expressing results with a sensible number of significant figures for the context. For general use, four to six significant digits are typically adequate. For trade, legal, or instrument calibration use the precision and uncertainty required by the applicable standards and measurement procedures."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply kilograms by 0.00110231131092439 to get short tons.",
      "Equivalently: convert kilograms to pounds by multiplying by 2.2046226218487757, then divide by 2000 to obtain short tons."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 kg × 0.00110231131092439 = 1.10231131092439 short tons (approx. 1.10231 short tons)",
      "500 kg × 0.00110231131092439 = 0.551155655462195 short tons (approx. 0.55116 short tons)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a short ton and a metric tonne?",
        "answer": "A US short ton equals 2000 pounds (about 907.18474 kg). A metric tonne, spelled tonne, equals exactly 1000 kilograms. Therefore 1 tonne ≈ 1.102311 short tons."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I use?",
        "answer": "For everyday conversions 4 to 6 significant digits are usually sufficient. For engineering, trade, or compliance use the number of digits and uncertainty specified by the relevant standard or contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are conversions exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion is based on defined unit relationships, but numerical results are subject to floating point rounding. For traceable measurements, follow metrology practices, record uncertainties, and calibrate instruments per applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I be concerned about calibration or regulatory compliance?",
        "answer": "If conversions support trade, legal weight declarations, safety-critical load calculations, or regulated reporting, ensure scales and measurement procedures are calibrated and documented according to standards such as those from NIST or ISO and any relevant national or industry regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert very large or very small values safely?",
        "answer": "Use software or calculators that support high-precision arithmetic or scientific notation for very large or very small values. Verify results and rounding rules when values approach the limits of the data type or instrument resolution."
