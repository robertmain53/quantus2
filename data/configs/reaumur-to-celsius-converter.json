    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms historical Reaumur temperatures to modern Celsius, enabling interpretation of old scientific data.",
      "Reaumur scale appears in antique scientific documents and equipment from 18th-19th century scientific work.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where Reaumur scale divides water's freezing-boiling range into 80 degrees."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "°C = °Ré / 0.8. To convert Reaumur to Celsius, divide by 0.8. For example, 0°Ré = 0°C, 80°Ré = 100°C.",
      "Historical scientific documents often reference temperatures in Reaumur scale measurements.",
      "Understanding historical temperature scales is essential for interpreting archival scientific records.",
      "This converter enables modern scientists to reference historical temperature data accurately."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Freezing point: 0°Ré = 0°C.",
      "Example 2 – Room temperature: 16°Ré = 20°C.",
      "Example 3 – Boiling point: 80°Ré = 100°C."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How do I convert Reaumur to Celsius?",
        "answer": "Divide Reaumur by 0.8 to get Celsius. Example: 40°Ré ÷ 0.8 = 50°C"
      },
      {
        "question": "Where would I encounter Reaumur temperatures?",
        "answer": "In archival scientific documents, antique laboratory instruments, and historical research papers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a quick approximation?",
        "answer": "Yes: °C ≈ °Ré × 1.25 (rough approximation for mental conversion)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's special about Reaumur's scale design?",
        "answer": "Reaumur used 80 divisions (vs. Celsius's 100) between freezing and boiling water."
      },
      {
        "question": "When was Reaumur scale last commonly used?",
        "answer": "Reaumur fell from favor in the 19th-20th centuries as Celsius standardized internationally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert Reaumur directly to Fahrenheit?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it's easier to convert Reaumur → Celsius → Fahrenheit in steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do archivists use for historical temperatures?",
        "answer": "Modern archivists convert all historical temperatures to Celsius for consistency and clarity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any modern uses of Reaumur?",
        "answer": "Reaumur is essentially obsolete; Celsius dominates all modern scientific and industrial applications."
