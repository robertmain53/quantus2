    "introduction": [
      "Use this calculator to estimate gross profit and gross margin from total revenue and cost of goods sold (COGS). Gross margin is a key profitability metric used to compare product-level or company-level efficiency in converting sales into profit before operating expenses, taxes, and interest.",
      "This tool returns gross profit in currency, gross margin as a percentage, and the margin expressed as a decimal ratio. Values are approximate and intended for analysis, planning, and benchmarking; use audited financial statements and a qualified accountant for official reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Gross profit equals total revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). Gross margin percentage equals gross profit divided by total revenue, multiplied by 100. Expressed as formulas: Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS. Gross Margin (%) = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100.",
      "This calculator implements those standard accounting formulas consistent with generally accepted accounting principles used for internal analysis and external reporting. When revenue is zero, margin is undefined; the tool will indicate that the percent and ratio cannot be computed in that case.",
      "Rounding and display: currency outputs are shown to two decimal places and percentage outputs are shown to one decimal place for clarity. For regulatory or audited statements, use exact ledger values and rounding rules required by your reporting standard (e.g., GAAP or IFRS)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Revenue = 10,000; COGS = 4,000 → Gross Profit = 6,000; Gross Margin = 60.0%.",
      "Example 2: Revenue = 25,000; COGS = 20,000 → Gross Profit = 5,000; Gross Margin = 20.0%."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What does a high gross margin mean?",
        "answer": "A higher gross margin indicates a larger portion of sales revenue remains after covering COGS to contribute to operating expenses and profit. High margins are common in service or software businesses; low margins are common in commodity or low-priced retail sectors. Compare margins to industry peers for context."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is gross margin different from net profit margin?",
        "answer": "Gross margin measures profitability before operating expenses, interest, and taxes. Net profit margin accounts for all expenses and income items and therefore will usually be lower. Use gross margin to assess production or product-level efficiency; use net margin to assess overall profitability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if revenue is zero or negative?",
        "answer": "If revenue equals zero the percentage and ratio are undefined; gross profit equals negative COGS (if COGS > 0). Negative revenue (rare) or returns should be reviewed in the accounting ledger. For decision-making, investigate timing, refunds, or data entry errors and consult financial statements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this calculator for per-unit gross margin?",
        "answer": "Yes. Calculate per-unit gross profit by dividing gross profit by units sold (compute gross profit here, then divide by units in your analysis). This tool focuses on aggregate revenue and COGS; include units in your external calculations if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Results follow standard arithmetic using the inputs you provide. They are accurate as mathematical outputs but rely on the correctness of your inputs. For audited reporting, reconciliation with your accounting system and review by a qualified accountant or auditor is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where should I look for formal accounting guidance?",
        "answer": "Refer to official accounting standards and government guidance for reporting requirements. Consult resources from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for U.S. GAAP, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public company reporting, and your tax authority for tax-specific rules."
