    "introduction": [
      "This Gross Margin Calculator computes gross profit and the gross margin ratio from net sales (revenue) and cost of goods sold (COGS). Use it to quickly assess product-level profitability or to sanity-check reported figures during financial review.",
      "Gross profit is a currency value equal to revenue minus COGS. Gross margin (ratio) expresses gross profit as a share of revenue and is shown here as a percentage for straightforward comparison across products, periods, or competitors."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator applies standard accounting definitions: gross profit = net sales − cost of goods sold; gross margin = gross profit ÷ net sales. Net sales should be revenue after returns, allowances, and sales discounts. COGS should include all direct costs tied to production or purchase of goods sold (materials, direct labor, production overhead allocated to goods sold).",
      "Results are computed with basic arithmetic. The gross margin output is produced as a ratio (0–1) and presented in percent. If net sales is zero, margin is undefined; the tool will indicate that division by zero would occur and return zero or an alert depending on UI handling—ensure inputs reflect net sales after discounts and returns.",
      "Rounding and display follow common practice: currency outputs are shown in local currency units with two-decimal precision where the hosting UI enforces formatting, and percent outputs are shown to one or two decimal places depending on context. Use company accounting policies (GAAP/IFRS) to determine inclusion/exclusion of specific items in COGS and revenue."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What should I include in COGS for this calculation?",
        "answer": "Include direct costs required to produce or purchase the goods sold: raw materials, direct labor, and production overhead allocated to the goods. Exclude operating expenses like marketing, distribution, and general administrative costs unless your accounting policy explicitly capitalizes them into inventory/COGS."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is gross margin the same as net profit margin?",
        "answer": "No. Gross margin measures profit after direct costs of goods sold. Net profit margin subtracts all operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other non-operational items. Use gross margin to assess production or product profitability; use net margin for overall business profitability."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle discounts, returns and allowances?",
        "answer": "Calculate net sales as gross revenue minus returns, allowances, and sales discounts. Enter net sales into the Net sales (revenue) field so the gross margin reflects the true revenue base associated with sold goods."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might my calculated margin differ from reported financial statements?",
        "answer": "Differences can arise from varying accounting boundaries: inventory valuation methods (FIFO vs. LIFO vs. weighted average), timing of expense recognition, capitalization policies, or inclusion of indirect production costs. For formal reporting, reconcile with your general ledger and the company’s accounting policy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the calculator for auditing or regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "This tool provides a quick, auditable arithmetic calculation suitable for analysis and internal checks. For statutory reporting, rely on your accounting system and financial statements prepared under applicable standards (GAAP or IFRS) and consult your auditor for formal disclosures."
