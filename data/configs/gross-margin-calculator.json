    "introduction": [
      "This Gross Margin Calculator computes gross profit, gross margin percentage, markup on cost, gross profit per unit, and a suggested price-per-unit to reach a target margin. It follows standard accounting practice used for internal performance monitoring and external reporting.",
      "Gross margin is a core profitability metric: gross margin (%) = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue. These results are intended for planning and analysis; use formal financial statements prepared under GAAP or local accounting rules for regulatory filings."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Gross profit is calculated as total sales revenue minus cost of goods sold. Gross margin percent is gross profit divided by sales revenue, multiplied by 100 to express as a percentage.",
      "Markup on cost is included because many pricing decisions start from cost. Markup (%) = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost * 100. When suggesting a price-per-unit to meet a target margin, the calculator uses the algebraic rearrangement: price = unit_cost / (1 - target_margin). Target margin must be entered as a decimal (for example, 0.35 for 35%).",
      "Inputs should reflect net sales (after discounts and returns) and fully loaded cost of goods sold (including direct materials, direct labor, and allocable production overhead). For regulatory and tax treatment consult relevant guidance before preparing official reports."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Enter $10,000 revenue and $6,000 COGS. Gross profit = $4,000. Gross margin = 40%. Markup on cost = 66.67%.",
      "Example 2: If unit cost is $15 and you want a 40% gross margin (0.40), suggested price = 15 / (1 - 0.40) = $25."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use gross margin to track product-level profitability and to set prices that cover direct costs before operating expenses and taxes.",
      "For financial reporting, reconcile these internal calculations with your accounting system and consult professional accountants for GAAP or IFRS treatments."
    ],
    "glossary": [
      "Gross profit: Revenue minus cost of goods sold.",
      "Gross margin: Gross profit divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage.",
      "Markup: Increase over cost, typically expressed as a percentage of cost.",
      "COGS: Direct costs attributable to goods produced and sold."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What inputs should I use for revenue and COGS?",
        "answer": "Use net sales (after discounts and returns) for revenue and include direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead in COGS. For production businesses include freight-in and manufacturing overhead as part of COGS per your accounting policy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is gross margin the same as net profit margin?",
        "answer": "No. Gross margin measures profitability before operating expenses, interest, and taxes. Net profit margin accounts for all expenses and is typically lower than gross margin."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise are the results and how should I round?",
        "answer": "Results are calculated algebraically from your inputs. Round currency values according to your reporting convention (cents for operational use, thousands for aggregated management reports). Percentages are typically rounded to one or two decimal places depending on reporting precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I treat returns, discounts, and allowances?",
        "answer": "Reduce gross sales by returns, trade discounts, and allowances to compute net sales. Ensure COGS reflects only the costs associated with goods actually sold. Adjust inventory and COGS per your accounting policies and standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or tax considerations I should be aware of?",
        "answer": "Yes. Financial statements used for regulatory filings or tax returns must comply with jurisdictional standards (for example, GAAP guidance published by standard setters). Consult a qualified accountant or tax advisor for filing and compliance questions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the suggested price formula use (1 - desired_margin) in the denominator?",
        "answer": "To achieve a target gross margin m, price p must satisfy (p - cost) / p = m. Solving for p gives p = cost / (1 - m). Enter m as a decimal (for example, 0.30 for 30%)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this calculator for service businesses?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you define 'unit cost' and 'COGS' appropriately. For many service businesses, direct labor and direct service delivery costs act as the COGS equivalent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What assumptions underlie these calculations?",
        "answer": "The calculator assumes straight algebraic relationships and accurate inputs. It does not allocate indirect overhead unless you include it in COGS. For audited financials or regulatory submissions, use your accounting system and follow applicable standards."
