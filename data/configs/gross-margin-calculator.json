1. This is a simple_calc because contribution margin is calculated from several related inputs (price, variable cost, quantity or totals) using a clear formula and produces one primary numeric result; users must supply multiple fields rather than a single unit conversion.

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or any extra UI/help fields; form is required for simple_calc and will be limited to allowed fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
