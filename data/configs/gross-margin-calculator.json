1. This is a simple_calc because gross margin requires multiple numeric inputs (sales/revenue and cost of goods sold, optionally other direct costs) and returns computed financial metrics (gross profit, gross margin percent/ratio) using well-defined formulas rather than a fixed unit conversion or multiple distinct calculation methods.

2. I will use component_type: 'simple_calc' with logic.type: 'formula'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no slug, name, category, meta, schema_org, canonical_url, robots, keywords, custom UI fields, or a form for converters).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
