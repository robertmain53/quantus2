    "introduction": [
      "This torque converter lets you switch instantly between foot-pounds (lb·ft) and newton-meters (N·m), the two most common torque units in engineering, automotive work, and laboratory applications.",
      "Use it whenever a service manual, torque wrench, or fastener specification is written in one system and your tools or data sheets use the other. The conversion factors are based on SI definitions and high-precision unit tables, so you can rely on consistent, repeatable results.",
      "Whether you're working on automotive fasteners, mechanical design, laboratory equipment, or maintenance procedures, this tool helps you translate torque values accurately between imperial and SI systems."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Torque is defined as the product of a force and its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation: torque = force × lever arm. One foot-pound (lb·ft) is the torque created by one pound-force applied at a perpendicular distance of one foot. One newton-meter (N·m) is the torque created by one newton applied at one meter.",
      "The exact conversion factor between foot-pounds and newton-meters comes from the definitions of force and distance in both unit systems. Using high-accuracy factors from NIST-aligned tables: 1 foot-pound = 1.3558179483 newton-meters, and 1 newton-meter ≈ 0.7375621493 foot-pounds.",
      "For practical engineering work, many handbooks round the conversion factor to 1.356 or even 1.36 for quick mental calculations. This calculator uses the full precision internally and rounds according to your chosen precision setting, keeping both accuracy and readability.",
      "When working with manufacturer specifications, always treat the original torque unit and any stated tolerance as authoritative. Use this converter to translate values into the units your tools display, then set your torque wrench or dynamometer accordingly.",
      "In professional environments, torque tools are typically calibrated on a schedule against a reference standard. For critical applications (vehicles, machines, lab equipment), periodic calibration verification is essential to maintain the relationship between dial readings and actual applied torque."

    "examples": [
      "Automotive: A cylinder head bolt specification of 80 lb·ft corresponds to approximately 108.47 N·m (80 × 1.3558179483). When working from manufacturer specifications, always follow the original torque values and procedures given in the service manual.",
      "Laboratory: A lab stirrer rated at 5 N·m delivers about 3.69 lb·ft (5 × 0.7375621493). For calibration labs or design calculations, you may require 2–3 significant figures to match the accuracy of your instruments.",
      "Mechanical design: Using crowfoot adapters or long extensions changes the effective lever arm. Most manufacturers provide correction formulas—apply those before or after using this unit converter to account for tool modifications."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from foot-pounds to newton-meters?",
        "answer": "One foot-pound (lb·ft) of torque equals 1.3558179483 newton-meters (N·m). This factor comes from the exact definitions of the pound-force, foot, newton, and meter in the SI and customary unit systems. For most practical engineering purposes, rounding to 1.356 or 1.36 is sufficiently accurate, but this calculator uses the full constant internally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a difference between ft·lb, lb·ft, and foot-pound?",
        "answer": "In everyday practice, ft·lb, lb·ft, and foot-pound are often used interchangeably to describe torque. Strictly speaking, the torque unit is pound-foot (lb·ft), indicating a pound-force applied one foot from the pivot. However, many service manuals and tools write ft·lb. This converter treats them as the same torque unit and assumes you are working with torque, not energy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How precise does my torque conversion need to be?",
        "answer": "It depends on your application. For automotive repair and general maintenance, specifications typically allow a tolerance of a few percent—rounding to 1 decimal place in N·m is usually acceptable. For mechanical design and lab work, you may require 2–3 significant figures. For calibration labs, calculations may use many more significant figures, but practical accuracy is limited by instrument calibration and environmental factors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this converter for dynamic or impact torque?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor between foot-pounds and newton-meters is strictly unit-based and does not change for dynamic or impact loads. However, measuring and specifying impact or transient torque is more complex and usually requires dedicated instrumentation and methods. For safety-critical or high-speed applications, rely on manufacturer data and test procedures rather than conversions alone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do engineering courses recommend using N·m instead of ft·lb?",
        "answer": "Most university engineering programs and scientific publications follow the International System of Units (SI), where newton-meter (N·m) is the standard unit of torque. Using N·m keeps equations, constants, and software libraries consistent and reduces the risk of mixing units. Converting torque data into N·m before analysis is a simple way to align your work with these conventions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do when converting torque values for critical applications?",
        "answer": "When converting torque values for real hardware (vehicles, machines, lab rigs), follow these steps: (1) Follow the original specification first—if a service manual specifies N·m, adjust your torque wrench to N·m when possible instead of converting. (2) Check your torque wrench scale—many now show both lb·ft and N·m. (3) Respect calibration intervals—torque tools should be calibrated against a reference standard on a regular schedule. (4) Document conversions for quality records so other engineers can reproduce your work."
