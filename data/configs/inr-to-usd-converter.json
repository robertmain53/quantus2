    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts amounts from Indian Rupees (INR) to United States Dollars (USD). It displays an indicative conversion using live mid‑market exchange rates and explains how displayed results relate to rates used by banks and money transfer services.",
      "Exchange rates fluctuate continuously. The value shown is the mid‑market (interbank) rate at the timestamp provided; final amounts when you send or receive money may differ because of provider spreads, fixed fees, local taxes, and regulatory withholdings.",
      "Use the converter for quick estimates, reconciliation, and budgeting. For payments or transfers, consult your bank or payment provider for the exact rate and total cost, and retain timestamps or receipts for compliance and bookkeeping."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary exchange rate: the tool uses an aggregated mid‑market rate derived from professional FX data feeds. Mid‑market means the midpoint between the best buy and sell prices in the interbank market at a given timestamp.",
      "Displayed result vs executed transaction: providers typically apply a spread (difference from mid‑market) and may add fixed or percentage fees. The converter shows the mid‑market estimate and flags that executed rates can be less favorable.",
      "Timestamping and refresh cadence: rates are timestamped in UTC. The UI refreshes rates at regular short intervals for accuracy, and users can view the exact timestamp used for each conversion. Historical reference rates are available for auditing or reconciliation.",
      "Precision and rounding follow ISO 4217 conventions for currencies (typically two decimal places for INR and USD). For settlement, some providers may use more precision; always confirm rounding rules with the counterparty."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "If rate is expressed as USD per INR (USD/INR): USD = INR × (USD per INR). Example: if 1 INR = 0.012 USD, then 1000 INR × 0.012 = 12.00 USD.",
      "If rate is expressed as INR per USD (INR/USD): USD = INR ÷ (INR per USD). Example: if 1 USD = 83.50 INR, then 1000 INR ÷ 83.50 = 11.98 USD.",
      "Displayed value is rounded to two decimal places by default following ISO 4217, but the underlying calculation uses higher‑precision floats; conversion engines preserve extra precision for downstream settlement where required."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How current are the exchange rates?",
        "answer": "Rates are taken from a live aggregated FX feed and are timestamped in UTC. They refresh at regular short intervals; the converter shows the exact timestamp used for the calculation to help with reconciliation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this include bank or transfer fees?",
        "answer": "No. The converter shows an indicative mid‑market result. Actual amounts you receive or pay will typically include provider spreads and fees. Check your bank or payment provider for the executed rate and any charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the conversion I get from my bank differ from this calculator?",
        "answer": "Banks and money‑transfer services often add a spread to the mid‑market rate, and may also apply fixed or percentage fees. Operational timing, liquidity, and regulatory requirements can also affect executed rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places do you show and why?",
        "answer": "We display results rounded to two decimal places per common practice and ISO 4217 guidance. The backend calculation preserves more precision; rounding rules used for settlement depend on the payment provider."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I reverse the conversion (USD → INR)?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use the reverse converter (USD → INR) which applies the reciprocal calculation. If a provider quotes a one‑way rate, always check whether that quote is for buy or sell side as values can differ."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are conversions legal in all cases and are there regulatory limits?",
        "answer": "Most retail conversions are legal, but transfers across borders may require KYC (Know Your Customer) checks, reporting, or adherence to currency control rules. For cross‑border payments check regulations from the relevant central bank or treasury authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative references on exchange‑rate reporting and standards?",
        "answer": "Authoritative references include central bank rate publications, IMF guidance on exchange‑rate data, and ISO 4217 for currency code and minor unit conventions. Links to those sources are provided in the citations below."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the converter for accounting or tax reporting?",
        "answer": "The converter provides indicative values suitable for estimates and preliminary accounting. For official accounting or tax reporting, use the exact rate and timestamp required by your jurisdiction, or the rate provided on official bank receipts."
