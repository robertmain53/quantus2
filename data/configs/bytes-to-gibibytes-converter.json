    "introduction": [
      "Convert a value in bytes to gibibytes (GiB) using the internationally standardized binary prefix. A gibibyte (GiB) is defined by the IEC and referenced by NIST as 2^30 bytes (1,073,741,824 bytes).",
      "This converter implements the exact mathematical relationship (no approximations) and is intended for data reporting, capacity planning, and technical documentation where binary prefixes are required for clarity and compliance.",
      "If you need decimal gigabytes (GB, where 1 GB = 10^9 bytes) use the separate decimal converter; this tool specifically provides the binary GiB conversion used in technical standards and many OS/tools."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We use the binary prefix definition adopted by IEC and cited by NIST: 1 gibibyte (GiB) = 2^30 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes. The conversion is exact and reversible.",
      "Input may be an integer or decimal byte value. The calculation performs a direct division by 2^30 and returns the numeric GiB value. Display precision can be adjusted in the UI; internally the conversion preserves full numeric precision before rounding for display.",
      "For traceability and regulatory alignment we cite primary standards and technical references (NIST, BIPM/ SI brochure, IEC references) so outputs can be documented in technical reports and compliance artifacts."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula (bytes → GiB): GiB = bytes ÷ 2^30",
      "Exact constant: 1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes (that is 2^30 bytes).",
      "Reverse (GiB → bytes): bytes = GiB × 2^30"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between GiB and GB?",
        "answer": "GiB (gibibyte) uses binary prefixes: 1 GiB = 2^30 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes. GB (gigabyte) uses decimal SI prefixes: 1 GB = 10^9 bytes = 1,000,000,000 bytes. Use GiB when you need the binary definition commonly used in operating systems and technical standards; use GB for decimal manufacturer labeling or SI-based contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do my operating system and storage vendor report different sizes?",
        "answer": "Many operating systems report sizes using binary prefixes (GiB) while some storage vendors advertise capacity in decimal GB. The difference stems from using 2^30 vs 10^9 as the base unit. To reconcile, convert vendor GB to bytes (GB × 10^9) or convert bytes to GiB using this tool for apples-to-apples comparisons."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The conversion between bytes and GiB using 2^30 is exact. Rounding only occurs when formatting the displayed result. Internally this converter computes using the exact integer constant 1,073,741,824 and only applies rounding for presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I display?",
        "answer": "Display precision depends on context. For user-facing capacity summaries, 2–3 decimal places are common (for example, 1.25 GiB). For technical reporting or auditing, show enough significant digits to preserve the required tolerance (for example, 6+ decimal places) and include unit labels (GiB)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large byte values safely?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical relationship scales linearly. For extremely large integers, ensure your environment supports the numeric range (use 64-bit integers or arbitrary-precision types). This tool assumes standard double-precision floating math for display; for exact integer arithmetic with very large values use a big‑integer library and the same constant (2^30)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I reproduce this conversion in scripts or command line?",
        "answer": "In common languages the conversion is bytes / (1024 ** 3). Example in Python: gib = bytes_value / (1024**3). This uses the exact binary power (2^30)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are binary prefixes recognized by standards bodies?",
        "answer": "Yes. Binary prefixes such as kibi, mebi, gibi were standardized by IEC and are documented and referenced by national metrology organizations including NIST and in the SI brochure published by BIPM. Use of GiB communicates exact binary meaning and reduces ambiguity in technical and regulatory contexts."
