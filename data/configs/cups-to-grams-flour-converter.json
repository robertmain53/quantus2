    "introduction": [
      "This converter turns cups of all-purpose flour into grams so you can move quickly between traditional household recipes and precise metric measurements.",
      "The tool is calibrated for standard all-purpose wheat flour and uses a single, consistent grams-per-cup factor derived from university food science guidance and professional baking references. Because flour is compressible, the actual weight in your kitchen can vary with how you fill the cup, so we also recommend using a digital scale whenever possible.",
      "Use this converter when you need a fast, reliable estimate for recipe development, nutrition calculations, or documenting procedures in a lab or food science setting where gram-level quantities are required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This converter assumes that 1 US measuring cup of all-purpose flour is approximately 120 grams. This value is widely used in baking science and is explicitly recommended by King Arthur Baking for their all-purpose flour and measurement standards, where they specify that one cup of all-purpose flour weighs about 120 grams under a fluff–scoop–level technique.",
      "The same 120 g-per-cup factor is used in food science instruction materials, such as a University of Massachusetts Amherst recipe conversion spreadsheet example, where household flour measures in cups are multiplied by 120 g per cup to obtain batch weights in grams for spreadsheet-based scaling.",
      "You may see some nutrition databases and FoodData Central–based tools list 1 cup of all-purpose flour at around 125 grams rather than 120 grams, reflecting a slightly denser packing and the fact that ingredient weights depend on how the cup is filled. For the purposes of this converter, we favor the 120 g-per-cup assumption because it aligns with professional baking guidance that emphasizes gently filled, leveled cups rather than packed flour.",
      "In practice, the true grams-per-cup in your kitchen can range roughly from 110 to 150 grams depending on your technique, humidity, and the specific flour brand. That is why university extension services, baking schools, and food science programs consistently recommend using a digital scale for critical work. This converter therefore serves as a standardized reference for planning, documentation, and quick checks, while the most accurate workflow remains to weigh the flour directly.",
      "For lab, R&D, and quality-control contexts, best practice is to choose a single reference weight per cup (such as 120 g), document that assumption in your protocol, and then use a scale for all actual weighing. The converter then becomes a convenient bridge between legacy or consumer recipes written in cups and your internal gram-based systems."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What weight per cup of flour does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This tool assumes that 1 US measuring cup of all-purpose flour is approximately 120 grams. That reference weight is consistent with professional baking guidance that treats a gently filled, leveled cup of all-purpose flour as about 120 g, and with university food science examples that use 120 g per cup in recipe conversion spreadsheets."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some sources say 1 cup of flour is 125 grams or more?",
        "answer": "Different sources report values from about 113 to 130 grams or more for 1 cup of all-purpose flour because flour is compressible and measurement technique matters. Nutrition databases and some tools that rely on FoodData Central often use 125 g per cup, which reflects a slightly more compact packing than the 120 g standard used by many baking professionals. The difference is method-related, not an error."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this converter suitable for all types of flour?",
        "answer": "No. The converter is calibrated specifically for standard all-purpose wheat flour. Whole-wheat, bread, cake, pastry, gluten-free, and specialty flours have different bulk densities and therefore different grams-per-cup values. For those flours you should consult a dedicated weight chart or the manufacturer's technical information, or weigh a representative cup on a scale and use that value for your own conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this cups-to-grams flour conversion for laboratory or food science work?",
        "answer": "Yes, as long as you treat the 120 g-per-cup relationship as a documented assumption rather than a direct physical constant. Many university food science programs illustrate recipe spreadsheets by multiplying cups of flour by 120 g per cup to obtain batch weights. In any lab or R&D environment, you should record the assumed grams per cup in your protocol and rely on a calibrated balance for actual weighing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter work for metric cups or only for US cups?",
        "answer": "This converter is based on the US customary measuring cup used in most American cookbooks and baking references. A metric cup used in some countries has a slightly different volume, so the gram value per metric cup of flour will be a bit different. If you are working strictly with metric cups, you should either weigh your own sample to establish a local grams-per-cup assumption or consult a conversion chart specific to metric cups."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I reduce error when measuring flour by volume?",
        "answer": "For better consistency: lightly fluff the flour in the bag or container, spoon it into the measuring cup without packing, then level it with a straight edge. This technique tends to land close to the 120 g-per-cup assumption used here. For critical recipes, professional baking curricula and extension services strongly recommend weighing flour with a digital scale instead of relying on volume measures alone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does this tool focus on all-purpose flour instead of a general cup-to-gram conversion?",
        "answer": "Converting between cups and grams always depends on the ingredient's density. A general cup-to-gram converter would be too vague for serious baking and food science work. By targeting all-purpose flour and anchoring the conversion to cited baking and academic references, this tool provides a more transparent, realistic starting point for anyone who needs reliable, documented flour conversions."
