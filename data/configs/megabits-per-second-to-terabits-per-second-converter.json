    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a data transfer rate expressed in megabits per second (Mbps) to terabits per second (Tbps) using the SI decimal definitions of mega (10^6) and tera (10^12). Use this converter for bandwidth planning, capacity specification, or technical documentation where decimal SI prefixes are required.",
      "Results are presented with clear guidance about the conversion factor, common rounding practices, and contexts where binary prefixes might instead be used. For regulated or audited measurements, consult the referenced standards to confirm the preferred prefix convention for your organization."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses SI prefix definitions per international practice: mega = 10^6 and tera = 10^12. Under these decimal rules, 1 terabit equals 1,000,000 megabits, so the conversion is a fixed division.",
      "Where precision matters, the converter outputs a numeric result; users should apply appropriate rounding for reporting. For regulatory or compliance contexts consult NIST and ISO guidance on units and nomenclature; IEEE documents address prefix usage in information technology, and employer safety standards remain applicable for physical installations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Recognize that 1 megabit = 10^6 bits and 1 terabit = 10^12 bits.",
      "Step 2: Derive the factor: 1 Tbps = 10^12 bits/sec ÷ 10^6 bits/sec per Mbps = 10^6 Mbps.",
      "Formula: Tbps = Mbps / 1,000,000. Conversely, Mbps = Tbps × 1,000,000."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1,000,000 Mbps = 1 Tbps (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 1).",
      "Example 2: 10,000 Mbps = 0.01 Tbps (10,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.01).",
      "Example 3: 2,500 Mbps = 0.0025 Tbps (2,500 ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.0025)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why use 1,000,000 as the divisor instead of a power-of-two value?",
        "answer": "SI decimal prefixes define mega as 10^6 and tera as 10^12. The decimal (base-10) definition is standard for network bandwidth. Binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi) are different and used mainly for storage. For authoritative guidance see the cited NIST and IEEE references."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round results for specification documents?",
        "answer": "Round according to the precision required by your specification or procurement process. For high-level bandwidth specs two or three significant digits are common; for performance testing, keep more precision and report measurement uncertainty. Always note the unit convention (decimal SI vs binary) when publishing values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion apply to bytes or megabytes?",
        "answer": "No. This converter works with bits. 1 byte = 8 bits. To convert megabytes per second (MB/s) to terabits per second, first convert MB/s to Mb/s by multiplying by 8, then use the Mbps→Tbps conversion factor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there compliance or safety considerations when using bandwidth numbers?",
        "answer": "Bandwidth numbers themselves are technical metrics. For compliance with documentation standards and procurement, follow NIST and ISO unit guidance. For physical deployments (cable routing, power equipment), consult workplace safety standards such as those published by the relevant national authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "What accuracy caveats should I be aware of?",
        "answer": "This conversion is exact mathematically given the SI definitions. Measurement uncertainty arises from how throughput is measured (protocol overhead, sampling interval, and equipment limitations). For measured throughput, include uncertainty bounds and measurement method when reporting figures."
