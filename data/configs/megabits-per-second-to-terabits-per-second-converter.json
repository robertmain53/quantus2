    "introduction": [
      "Convert data-rate values from megabits per second (Mbps) to terabits per second (Tbps) quickly and accurately using SI (decimal) prefixes. This converter assumes the standard decimal definitions used in networking and telecommunications where 1 megabit = 10^6 bits and 1 terabit = 10^12 bits.",
      "Use this tool to check link capacity, aggregate interfaces, or confirm documentation values. For contexts that use binary prefixes (mebibit, gibibit) or when switching between bits and bytes, see the methodology and FAQs for exact factors and measurement guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "This conversion follows SI decimal prefixes: mega (M) = 10^6 and tera (T) = 10^12. Therefore all conversions use powers of ten rather than powers of two unless explicitly noted.",
      "The converter performs a direct unit ratio conversion: it converts Mbps to bits/second, then scales to Tbps using the SI factors. This matches guidance from international standards bodies on prefix meanings.",
      "When converting measurement results from test equipment, consider device resolution and aggregation method. Reported throughput may be averaged over an interval; always check whether the source reported bits or bytes and whether binary prefixes were used."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Interpret 1 Mbps = 1 × 10^6 bits per second.",
      "Step 2: Interpret 1 Tbps = 1 × 10^12 bits per second.",
      "Formula: Tbps = Mbps × (10^6 / 10^12) = Mbps × 10^-6.",
      "Alternately: 1 Tbps = 1,000,000 Mbps, so divide Mbps by 1,000,000 to get Tbps."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 Mbps = 0.001 Tbps (1000 × 10^-6 = 0.001).",
      "1,000,000 Mbps = 1 Tbps.",
      "500,000 Mbps = 0.5 Tbps."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this converter using decimal (SI) or binary prefixes?",
        "answer": "This converter uses decimal (SI) prefixes: mega = 10^6, tera = 10^12. In networking, Mbps and Tbps almost always use decimal prefixes. If you need binary prefixes (mebibits, Mib/s where 1 Mib = 2^20 bits), perform a separate conversion that accounts for the 2^10 increments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert Mbps to terabytes per month?",
        "answer": "To convert Mbps to terabytes per month (decimal bytes): first convert Mbps to bits per second, multiply by seconds per month (e.g., 30 days = 2,592,000 s), divide by 8 to get bytes, and then divide by 10^12 for terabytes (decimal). Example: X Mbps → X×10^6×2,592,000 / 8 / 10^12 = terabytes/month."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about megabytes (MB) vs megabits (Mb)?",
        "answer": "Megabit (Mb or Mbps) refers to bits. Megabyte (MB) refers to bytes; 1 byte = 8 bits. To convert Mbps to MB/s, divide by 8 and then by 10^6 if converting to megabytes per second (decimal)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "Match the precision to your measurement method. For link-speed specs, 3 significant figures is typical; for test instrumentation with known resolution, report to the instrument's calibrated precision and include measurement interval and averaging method. Avoid implying greater accuracy than the measuring device supports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or measurement standards I should follow?",
        "answer": "Use international SI prefix definitions and follow guidance from standards organizations when publishing capacity or compliance figures. Regulatory agencies may publish specific testing or reporting guidance for broadband and service-level measurements—consult the relevant government or standards documents for formal requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do some sources show different results for the same numbers?",
        "answer": "Differences usually come from (1) mixing bits and bytes, (2) mixing decimal and binary prefixes, or (3) differences in averaging intervals and measurement methodology. Verify the original unit, prefix system, and measurement interval before comparing figures."
