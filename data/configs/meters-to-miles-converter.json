    "introduction": [
      "Use this converter to change lengths from meters to miles using the internationally agreed constant. The conversion is suitable for quick checks, engineering notes, lab reports, route planning, and unit normalization in datasets.",
      "The tool applies the exact international definition of the statute mile so results are reproducible and compliant with measurement standards used by national laboratories and standards bodies.",
      "For critical, regulated, or legal measurements (road signage, certified surveys, safety zones), follow the applicable federal or local standards and retain calibration records from measurement instruments."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The international statute mile is defined exactly as 1609.344 meters by international agreement. This converter uses that exact value to ensure consistency with standards from national metrology institutes.",
      "Conversion is a fixed-ratio operation: when converting from meters to miles the calculator divides the meter value by 1609.344. For reverse conversion multiply miles by 1609.344.",
      "When reporting results, choose the number of significant digits appropriate to your measurement instrument and application. For scientific and regulatory uses, reference NIST, BIPM, and any domain-specific standards (for example, transportation or surveying guidance)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: miles = meters ÷ 1609.344 (exact).",
      "Reverse formula: meters = miles × 1609.344 (exact).",
      "Practical steps shown in Pro view: 1) enter meters, 2) apply the exact divisor 1609.344, 3) round to the required significant digits or decimal places based on instrument resolution or regulatory requirements."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 meters → 1000 ÷ 1609.344 = 0.621371192 miles (rounded as needed).",
      "1609.344 meters → 1609.344 ÷ 1609.344 = 1.0 mile (exact by definition).",
      "5000 meters → 5000 ÷ 1609.344 ≈ 3.106855961 miles (reporting: 3.1069 mi if 5 significant figures are needed)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor does this use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the internationally agreed exact definition: 1 mile = 1609.344 meters. That value is fixed and used by national measurement institutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which 'mile' is this (statute, nautical, metric)?",
        "answer": "This tool converts to the international statute mile (commonly used on road signs and land distances). It does not convert to a nautical mile; a nautical mile equals exactly 1852 meters and requires a different conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places or significant digits should I report?",
        "answer": "Match the precision to your measuring instrument and the purpose of the value. For engineering calculations, 4–6 significant figures are common; for route planning 2–3 decimals may be sufficient. For regulated work follow the precision rules in your domain standards and retain instrument calibration details."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion affected by location, temperature, or calibration?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion factor is exact and location-independent. However, measured distances can be affected by instrument calibration, environmental factors (thermal expansion of measuring tapes), or GPS accuracy. Account for measurement uncertainty separately from the unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for legal or certified measurements (surveys, road signage)?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is correct for unit transformation, but legal and certified measurements require traceable instruments, documented calibration, and compliance with local regulations. Consult your national metrology institute or relevant regulator (for example transportation authorities) when measurements are used in a legal or safety context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator support batch or spreadsheet conversions?",
        "answer": "This single-value converter is intended for quick, one-value conversions. For bulk conversions use spreadsheet formulas (e.g., in Excel: =A2/1609.344) or programmatic routines that apply the same exact factor consistently across datasets."
