    "introduction": [
      "Convert a length measured in metres (meters) to statute miles instantly. This tool uses the internationally agreed exact relationship between the metre and the mile so results are suitable for engineering, mapping, and everyday use.",
      "The conversion follows the international definition where 1 mile = 1,609.344 metres exactly. Use the built-in precision controls for display rounding when presenting results in reports or signage."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply the fixed, exact international ratio: miles = metres ÷ 1609.344. This definition traces to international agreements that fixed the inch at exactly 0.0254 metres and therefore the mile at exactly 1,609.344 metres.",
      "For user-facing results we format using standard decimal rounding; retain additional digits for engineering or survey work and abide by calibration limits of your measurement device. For traceable measurements and calibration best practices, consult national metrology guidance.",
      "When converting values used in regulated reporting or surveying, validate instrument calibration and document measurement uncertainty. National metrology institutes publish guidance on calibration and uncertainty that should be followed for compliance and traceability."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula (exact): 1 mile = 1609.344 metres (international statute mile).",
      "Convert metres to miles: miles = metres ÷ 1609.344",
      "Equivalent multiplier: miles = metres × 0.0006213711922373339 (exactly 1/1609.344 rendered to typical double precision).",
      "For manual checks: 1,000 metres ≈ 0.621371 miles, 5,000 metres ≈ 3.106855 miles. Keep uncertainty from measurement instruments separate from conversion rounding."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 metres → 500 ÷ 1609.344 = 0.3106855 miles (rounded to 0.31069 miles at 5 decimal places).",
      "1609.344 metres → 1609.344 ÷ 1609.344 = 1 mile (exact by definition).",
      "10,000 metres → 10,000 ÷ 1609.344 = 6.2137119 miles (common marathon-distance reference: 42,195 metres ≈ 26.218757 miles)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between metres and miles?",
        "answer": "By international agreement, 1 mile (statute mile) is exactly 1,609.344 metres. Use miles = metres ÷ 1609.344 for exact conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is 1609.344 used rather than a rounded factor?",
        "answer": "The value 1609.344 arises from the exact definition tying the inch to 0.0254 metres. That exactness makes 1 mile exactly 1609.344 metres. For presentation you may round results, but the conversion constant itself is exact."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context: 2–3 decimals for everyday distances, 4–6 for navigation or mapping, and retain full numeric precision for engineering calculations. Always report measurement uncertainty separately when precision matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a nautical mile the same as a statute mile?",
        "answer": "No. A nautical mile is defined as exactly 1852 metres, used in maritime and aviation contexts. A statute (land) mile is exactly 1609.344 metres. Use the appropriate conversion for the domain."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about the US survey mile or survey foot?",
        "answer": "There is a historical US survey foot/mile that differs slightly from the international foot/mile. National metrology guidance has moved toward the international definitions; check your regulatory or survey authority if you must convert legacy survey data."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to consider instrument calibration when converting?",
        "answer": "Yes. Conversion is exact, but measurement error comes from the instrument. For traceable results and regulated reporting, ensure instruments are calibrated to national standards and document measurement uncertainty per metrology guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert metres per second to miles per hour with this tool?",
        "answer": "This converter handles length units only. To convert speed, divide metres per second by 0.44704 to get miles per hour, or use a dedicated speed conversion tool."
