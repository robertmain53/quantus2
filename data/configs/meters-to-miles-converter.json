    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a length value in meters to miles using the internationally agreed exact relationship. The international mile is defined as exactly 1,609.344 meters, a value used in scientific, engineering, and most regulatory contexts.",
      "Use this tool for quick, standards-aligned unit conversion. For surveying or legacy geodetic work, note that a U.S. survey mile differs slightly; see the methodology and citations for guidance on which definition to use."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally defined fixed relationship: 1 mile = 1,609.344 meters. This factor is established by international agreement and maintained in standards maintained by national laboratories and the BIPM.",
      "If your work requires legacy survey units, the U.S. survey foot (and therefore the U.S. survey mile) is different by a few parts per million. For legal, land-survey, or geodetic reporting, confirm which mile variant your agency or contract requires before reporting converted values.",
      "For measurement accuracy and reporting, account for instrument precision and calibration. When converting measured values, round the final result to match the originating instrument’s uncertainty and follow the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) for formal uncertainty statements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula (international mile): miles = meters ÷ 1609.344",
      "If you need the U.S. survey mile for surveying legacy data: miles_survey = meters ÷ 1609.347218694 (use only where explicitly required by contract or agency guidance)",
      "Rounding guidance: match output significant figures to the measurement uncertainty of the input (for example, a 1 mm precision measurement should not be reported more precisely than the instrument supports)"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between meters and miles?",
        "answer": "The international mile is defined exactly as 1,609.344 meters. This exact factor is used for scientific and most regulatory purposes; authoritative guidance is available from national measurement institutes and the BIPM."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the U.S. survey mile differ and when should I use it?",
        "answer": "The U.S. survey mile derives from the U.S. survey foot, a legacy unit used in geodesy and surveying. It differs from the international mile by a few parts per million. Use the survey mile only when specified by surveying contracts, historical datasets, or agency standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show after conversion?",
        "answer": "Report results to reflect the originating instrument’s precision and the measurement uncertainty. As a rule, do not present more significant digits than the measurement supports; consult the GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) for formal uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter adjust for map projections or geodetic datum?",
        "answer": "No. Unit conversion between meters and miles is purely a scale conversion. For geodetic or map-projection work, horizontal distances can be affected by projection and datum transformations; apply those corrections before unit conversion and follow agency geodetic guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this converter for regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion here is standards-based, but for regulatory submissions check the reporting agency’s specified units and rounding rules. Retain traceable measurement records and calibration certificates where required."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I consider for instrument calibration and measurement limits?",
        "answer": "Ensure measuring instruments are calibrated and that you record the instrument’s uncertainty. For tape measures, laser distance meters, or survey equipment, consult accredited calibration labs and the instrument manufacturer. Where legal or safety compliance is involved, retain calibration certificates from an accredited laboratory."
