    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length measured in meters to statute miles using the internationally accepted fixed relationship between the metre and the mile. It is intended for everyday use, engineering estimates, and reporting where a simple, reliable unit conversion is required.",
      "Results are presented with clear guidance on precision and rounding so you can choose an appropriate level of accuracy for your application. Where legal, regulatory, or engineering traceability is required, consult the cited standards and follow your organisation's calibration and documentation procedures."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The metre is the SI base unit of length and is defined via physical constants. The statute mile used in common conversions is defined as exactly 1609.344 metres by international agreement. Conversions therefore use an exact metre-to-mile relationship for the statute mile.",
      "This converter applies the exact international relationship and presents results with configurable rounding suggestions. For critical measurements, follow traceability and calibration best practices as described by national metrology institutes and relevant ISO standards.",
      "Recommendations on significant figures are provided for different use cases (quick estimates, engineering, surveying). Where another 'mile' is required (for example a nautical mile), use the appropriate conversion factor (nautical mile = 1852 metres)."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula (statute mile): miles = meters ÷ 1609.344",
      "Equivalent multiplier: miles = meters × 0.00062137119223733 (factor derived from 1 ÷ 1609.344)",
      "For nautical mile conversions use: nautical miles = meters ÷ 1852"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "500 meters → 500 ÷ 1609.344 = 0.310685596 miles (rounded to 0.310686 for six significant digits).",
      "1609.344 meters → 1609.344 ÷ 1609.344 = 1.0 mile (exact by definition).",
      "10000 meters → 10000 × 0.00062137119223733 = 6.2137119223733 miles (commonly reported as 6.21371)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use miles = meters ÷ 1609.344 for statute miles; the factor is exact by international agreement.",
      "Choose rounding based on use case: 3 significant digits for everyday use, 5–7 for engineering, and follow metrology guidance for legal or measurement-critical work."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes for the statute mile. The statute mile is defined as exactly 1609.344 metres, so the mathematical relationship for converting metres to statute miles is exact. Practical results are then rounded to the level of precision you require."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a statute mile and a nautical mile?",
        "answer": "A statute mile (used for road distances) is exactly 1609.344 metres. A nautical mile, used in maritime and aviation navigation, is exactly 1852 metres. Use the appropriate factor for the unit you need."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Suggested significant figures: 3 figures (general use), 5–7 figures (engineering), follow laboratory or legal metrology guidance for certifications. Consider measurement uncertainty when reporting final values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "This converter performs a mathematical unit conversion only. It does not estimate instrument uncertainty or calibration error. For traceable measurements and uncertainty budgets, consult national metrology guidelines (for example NIST) and ISO standards on measurement uncertainty and calibration procedures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert miles back to metres?",
        "answer": "Yes. The inverse conversion is metres = miles × 1609.344. Because 1609.344 is exact for the statute mile, the inverse relationship is exact before rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there standards I should reference for formal reporting?",
        "answer": "Yes. For unit definitions and traceability consult national metrology publications and ISO standards listed in the citations. For workplace measurement practices and safety considerations, refer to applicable regulatory guidance."
