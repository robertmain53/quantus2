    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a length value in meters to statute miles using the fixed, internationally recognised relationship between these units. It is intended for engineers, scientists, students, and anyone who needs a precise conversion between metric and imperial length units.",
      "Results are computed from the exact conversion factor used by national metrology institutes and international standards bodies. Guidance is included on rounding, display precision, and legal considerations for measurements used in commerce or safety-critical contexts."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the exact fixed ratio defined by national metrology authorities: 1 statute mile is 1609.344 meters. The conversion is therefore a simple multiplication or division by this constant and does not rely on approximations beyond floating-point arithmetic.",
      "Standards and guidance consulted include publications from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and relevant standards repositories. Users who require traceable or legally enforceable measurements should follow their local regulations and apply documented calibration and uncertainty practices as described by NIST and ISO."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "To convert meters to miles: miles = meters ÷ 1609.344.",
      "To convert miles to meters (for verification): meters = miles × 1609.344.",
      "When presenting results, choose an appropriate number of significant figures for your context. For general-purpose display, four to six significant digits is typical; for scientific or engineering reports include measurement uncertainty per ISO and NIST guidance."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 000 meters ÷ 1609.344 = 0.6213711922 miles (displayed commonly as 0.621371).",
      "5 000 meters ÷ 1609.344 = 3.1068559615 miles (displayed commonly as 3.10686).",
      "16 093.44 meters ÷ 1609.344 = 10 miles (exact by definition)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The defined relationship used here is exact for the statute mile: 1 mile = 1609.344 meters. Any small differences in displayed results are due to chosen rounding or floating-point representation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which mile is used: statute mile or nautical mile?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the statute mile (international mile) equal to 1609.344 meters. Nautical miles are different (1 nautical mile = 1852 meters) and are not used by this tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Choose precision to match the context. For navigation or surveying include uncertainty and use standards-based rounding. For everyday use, four to six significant digits is adequate. For legal metrology follow local regulations and calibration documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there limitations for very large or very small values?",
        "answer": "Floating-point limits apply in computing environments. Extremely large or tiny values may lose precision. For critical applications use arbitrary-precision arithmetic or report values with uncertainty and units per ISO and NIST recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for trade or legal measurement?",
        "answer": "For trade, custody transfer, or legally binding measurements, follow national metrology office guidance and local regulations. This tool provides the numeric conversion but does not replace certified measurement instruments, traceable calibration, or documented uncertainty statements."
