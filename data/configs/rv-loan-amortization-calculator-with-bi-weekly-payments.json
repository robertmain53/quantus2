      "This tool computes RV loan amortization for multiple payment conventions: standard monthly amortization, true bi‑weekly amortization (26 payments per year using a bi‑weekly periodic rate), and the common 'monthly/2' bi‑weekly approximation. It supports optional balloon amounts and recurring extra payments.",
      "For accurate comparisons, select the method that matches your loan documents or dealer quote. The bi‑weekly accelerated method typically shortens the loan term compared with dividing a monthly payment by two because it applies 26 payments per year."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Calculations use standard amortization formulas for fixed‑rate loans. For periodic payment P, principal L, periodic rate r, and number of periods n: P = (L * r) / (1 - (1 + r) ** -n). When a balloon is specified, the schedule treats the balloon as a remaining principal due at the final period and reduces the periodic payment accordingly.",
      "Numeric operations are implemented with attention to floating point stability and rounding consistent with IEEE 754 recommendations for binary floating point arithmetic. Validation and test vectors follow reproducible checks. Users should note that displayed results are rounded for readability; the downloadable schedule contains full precision.",
      "Operational guidance and precision considerations reference public standards for numeric accuracy and system assurance: NIST guidance on measurement and validation, ISO standards on financial data formats, IEEE recommendations on floating point arithmetic, and workplace safety guidance where applicable to physical handling and insurance steps. These references are for technical assurance; they do not imply regulatory or legal advice."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Compute net loan amount = principal - down_payment - trade_in.",
      "Step 2: Convert APR to periodic rate = APR / 100 / payments_per_year (payments_per_year = 12 for monthly, 26 for bi‑weekly).",
      "Step 3: Number of periods n = term_years * payments_per_year.",
      "Step 4: If balloon is zero, periodic payment P = (L × r) / (1 - (1 + r) ** -n). If a balloon exists, the periodic payment is computed so that the present value of payments plus the discounted balloon equals the loan principal.",
      "Step 5: Total paid = periodic_payment * n + balloon. Total interest = total_paid - loan - balloon."

    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $50,000 loan, 6.5% APR, 10 years. Monthly payment computed with 120 periods and monthly_rate = 0.065/12. Bi‑weekly accelerated uses 260 periods and periodic_rate = 0.065/26.",
      "Example 2: Same loan with $5,000 down payment and a $5,000 balloon: net loan = 40,000 and the final balloon is added to total paid and interest calculations."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which bi‑weekly method should I use?",
        "answer": "Use 'Bi‑Weekly (26 payments/year)' when your lender specifies a bi‑weekly periodic rate or you will make 26 equal payments per year. Use 'Bi‑Weekly via half‑monthly split' when you merely split a quoted monthly payment in half and will make 26 payments per year; results will be similar but may differ slightly in payoff time and interest."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does an extra payment affect payoff?",
        "answer": "Any recurring extra_payment reduces principal each period and shortens payoff time. The tool adds extra_payment to each scheduled payment when computing totals, which accelerates amortization and reduces total interest."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do results match my lender's exact statement?",
        "answer": "This calculator follows standard amortization math but may differ from lender statements when daily interest accrual, exact compounding conventions, fee structures, or rounding rules differ. Use the lender's disclosure as the authoritative source for contractual amounts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these numbers exact?",
        "answer": "Displayed numbers are rounded for clarity. The underlying calculations follow IEEE 754 numeric conventions; small differences can arise from rounding, payment timing conventions, or if a lender uses daily interest accrual or different compounding. Use the downloadable amortization schedule for full precision."
