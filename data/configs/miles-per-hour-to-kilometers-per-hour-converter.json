    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms speeds from miles per hour (mph) to kilometers per hour (km/h) using the mathematically exact relationship between these units. It is designed for anyone comparing US-standard vehicle speeds with metric-standard speeds, interpreting imported vehicle specifications, understanding international traffic regulations, or working with multi-regional transportation data.",
      "When you see a speed in miles per hour and need to understand it in metric terms—such as comparing a 65 mph US highway speed with European highway speeds (typically around 130 km/h)—this converter provides the exact, legally defined relationship.",
      "The conversion is grounded in the international treaty-defined relationship between the mile and the kilometer, making results reliable for vehicle specifications, traffic law compliance, speedometer verification, and technical documentation across jurisdictions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The mile and kilometer are related by an internationally agreed-upon definition established in 1959: 1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers (exactly). Since speed is distance per unit time, a speed in miles per hour is directly proportional to kilometers per hour by this same factor. Therefore, to convert from mph to km/h, you multiply the speed by 1.609344.",
      "For example, a vehicle traveling at 65 mph is traveling at 65 × 1.609344 ≈ 104.61 km/h. Conversely, 50 mph ≈ 80.47 km/h. This same factor applies whether you are converting individual speed measurements, comparing traffic regulations, or analyzing vehicle performance across regions.",
      "The converter applies this multiplication internally using full-precision floating-point arithmetic. Results are displayed rounded to practical precision (typically two decimal places), but the underlying calculation maintains maximum precision, ensuring results suitable for vehicle specifications, traffic enforcement, and safety analysis.",
      "Because the conversion factor (1.609344) is exact and treaty-defined, this converter produces results that match the official speedometer displays and vehicle specification documents from manufacturers worldwide. The factor has been in use for speed conversions by governments, vehicle manufacturers, and navigation systems since 1959."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – US highway reference: The typical US interstate speed limit is 65–70 mph. Converting 65 mph gives 65 × 1.609344 ≈ 104.61 km/h, comparable to European highway speeds of 100–110 km/h. At 75 mph, the equivalent is approximately 120.70 km/h.",
      "Example 2 – Urban speeds: A US city speed limit of 25 mph converts to approximately 40.23 km/h, typical for residential areas in metric countries. City speeds of 35 mph ≈ 56.33 km/h.",
      "Example 3 – Performance and weather: A hurricane with sustained winds of 150 mph converts to approximately 241.40 km/h, and a high-speed train traveling at 200 mph achieves about 321.87 km/h—useful for comparing extreme speeds across reporting standards.",
      "Example 4 – Vehicle import specifications: An imported US vehicle rated at 120 mph top speed converts to approximately 193.12 km/h, helping owners understand acceleration and performance in metric contexts."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion from miles per hour to kilometers per hour?",
        "answer": "The exact factor is 1 mph = 1.609344 km/h. To convert any speed in mph to km/h, multiply by 1.609344. This factor is defined by international treaty (1959) relating the mile to the meter, and it is the standard used by all vehicle manufacturers and governments worldwide."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is the conversion factor exactly 1.609344?",
        "answer": "This is the internationally agreed definition of the relationship between the mile and the kilometer. In 1959, the US, UK, and Commonwealth countries adopted a unified definition: 1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers. This was created to ensure consistency in speed conversions, vehicle specifications, and technical documentation globally."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I quickly estimate mph to km/h in my head?",
        "answer": "A useful mental shortcut is to multiply mph by 1.6 or by 5/3 to get a close km/h value. For example, 60 mph × 1.6 = 96 km/h (actual: 96.56), and 50 mph × 1.6 = 80 km/h (actual: 80.47). This approximation is accurate to within about 1%, making it very practical for quick conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do vehicle speedometers display both mph and km/h?",
        "answer": "Modern vehicle speedometers, especially those built for international markets, display both scales simultaneously. They use this exact conversion factor (1.609344) to ensure that the mph and km/h readings are perfectly synchronized, so a speed of 65 mph always corresponds to 104.61 km/h on the same instrument."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion accurate for regulatory and technical contexts?",
        "answer": "Yes. The factor 1.609344 is the legally defined relationship and is used by all governmental traffic enforcement, vehicle certification bodies, and manufacturers. For traffic law compliance, vehicle specifications, and safety analysis, this converter provides results that match official standards worldwide."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use in the result?",
        "answer": "For most contexts (driving, traffic regulations, vehicle specifications), one to two decimal places are sufficient. For technical engineering or legal documentation, maintain three to four significant figures (e.g., 65 mph = 104.61 km/h). The converter provides full precision internally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this converter for aircraft or wind speeds?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion factor 1.609344 applies to all speeds—vehicle speeds, wind speeds, water speeds, or any velocity measured in miles per hour vs kilometers per hour. The relationship between the mile and kilometer is universal and independent of what is being measured."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do automatic conversions in GPS and navigation apps work?",
        "answer": "GPS units and navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze, Apple Maps) store speed data internally and convert to the user's preferred unit using this exact factor. Modern vehicles with integrated navigation automatically display speeds in both mph and km/h using this same conversion, ensuring perfect consistency."
