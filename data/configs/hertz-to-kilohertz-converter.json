    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts frequencies expressed in gigahertz (GHz) to kilohertz (kHz) using the International System of Units (SI) prefix definitions. It is intended for engineers, technicians, students, and anyone who needs accurate, SI-consistent unit conversions.",
      "SI prefixes scale by powers of ten: giga (G) means 10^9 and kilo (k) means 10^3. Converting between prefixed units applies those powers directly—no instrument-specific corrections are applied by the converter.",
      "For measurement and lab use, pay attention to instrument resolution, calibration traceability, and stated uncertainty. See the methodology and FAQs below for practical notes and references to standards bodies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion relies on SI prefix magnitudes: 1 gigahertz = 10^9 hertz, 1 kilohertz = 10^3 hertz. Therefore convert by adjusting the exponent difference between prefixes.",
      "We apply a fixed mathematical relationship (no estimation): multiply the GHz value by 1,000,000 (10^6) to get kHz. This follows SI guidance published by international metrology authorities.",
      "When using measured values, preserve significant figures consistent with the instrument's uncertainty and round only after conversion. For traceable calibration and uncertainty guidance, consult national metrology authorities and ISO/IEC 17025 accredited labs."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 Hz is the SI unit for frequency. SI prefixes: kilo (k) = 10^3, giga (G) = 10^9.",
      "Step formula: kHz = GHz × (10^9 / 10^3) = GHz × 10^6.",
      "Example calculation: 2.5 GHz × 10^6 = 2,500,000 kHz. For scientific notation: 2.5 × 10^9 Hz = 2.5 × 10^6 kHz."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 GHz = 1,000,000 kHz",
      "2.5 GHz = 2,500,000 kHz",
      "0.001 GHz = 1,000 kHz",
      "Frequency in scientific notation: 3.6 × 10^2 GHz = 3.6 × 10^8 kHz"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from GHz to kHz?",
        "answer": "Multiply by 1,000,000 (10^6). This follows SI prefixes: G (giga) = 10^9, k (kilo) = 10^3, so 10^9 / 10^3 = 10^6."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep after conversion?",
        "answer": "Keep at most as many significant figures as the original measured value justifies, based on instrument resolution and uncertainty. Do not invent precision by adding digits beyond the instrument's stated uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert measured frequency readings from lab equipment directly with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes for unit conversion only. For measurement reporting, also include instrument uncertainty, calibration date, and traceability to a national metrology institute. Follow ISO/IEC 17025 guidance for lab accreditation and uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from kHz to GHz?",
        "answer": "Divide the kHz value by 1,000,000 (10^6) to return to GHz. Equivalently, GHz = kHz × 10^-6."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or safety considerations when working with RF frequencies?",
        "answer": "Yes. Frequency allocations and emission limits are regulated by national authorities. For safe and compliant RF work consult relevant regulatory bodies and spectrum authorities for licensing and exposure limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for measurement uncertainty or instrument error?",
        "answer": "No. This converter performs only the mathematical unit change. To account for uncertainty, propagate the instrument's stated uncertainty through the multiplication and report both converted value and expanded uncertainty following accepted metrology practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a quick way to express very large converted numbers?",
        "answer": "Use scientific notation (for example, 1 GHz = 1.0 × 10^6 kHz) or include engineering prefixes (e.g., 1,000,000 kHz = 1 × 10^6 kHz) when reporting in technical documents."
