      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms digital storage measurements from gigabytes (GB) to megabytes (MB), scaling down large storage capacity measurements to individual file sizes. It is designed for users working with file specifications, data transfer calculations, and detailed storage planning.",
        "Gigabytes are standard for device capacity and large data collections, while megabytes are appropriate for understanding individual file sizes and transfer calculations. This conversion is essential for bandwidth planning, storage allocation, and digital asset management.",
        "The converter applies the standardized decimal relationship (1 GB = 1,000 MB) used by storage manufacturers, operating systems, and networking specifications worldwide."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The gigabyte (GB) and megabyte (MB) are units of digital data storage in the decimal system used by storage manufacturers and operating systems. The relationship is: 1 GB = 1,000 MB (or equivalently, 1 MB = 0.001 GB). This decimal system (base 10) is the standard used in all consumer and enterprise storage specifications.",
        "To convert a data size from gigabytes to megabytes, you multiply the GB value by 1,000. For example, 5 GB = 5,000 MB, 2.5 GB = 2,500 MB, and 0.75 GB = 750 MB. This conversion is used in software specifications, data transfer rate calculations, and storage capacity planning.",
        "The converter applies straightforward decimal multiplication internally to maintain accuracy. Results are displayed with appropriate precision, suitable for file specifications, bandwidth calculations, and digital storage planning.",
        "Because this conversion uses the standard decimal system (base 10), results align with how storage manufacturers label device capacity, how operating systems report file sizes, and how software specifies storage and transfer requirements."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Software specification: A video game requiring 50 GB converts to 50,000 MB, making it easy to understand the file size relative to individual assets.",
        "Example 2 – Media storage: A movie collection of 2 TB (2,000 GB) converts to 2,000,000 MB, useful for estimating storage allocation and backup time.",
        "Example 3 – Data transfer: Uploading 100 GB of data to the cloud requires transferring 100,000 MB, relevant for bandwidth and time calculations.",
        "Example 4 – Archive capacity: A backup drive of 5 TB (5,000 GB) has a capacity of 5,000,000 MB, useful for understanding total file count and allocation planning."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How do I convert GB to MB for file specifications?",
          "answer": "Simply multiply the GB value by 1,000. For example, a 2 GB file equals 2,000 MB. This conversion is useful when you need to express storage capacity or file size in smaller units for technical specifications or comparisons."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this the same as binary conversion (GiB/MiB)?",
          "answer": "No. This converter uses the decimal system (1 GB = 1,000 MB), which is the standard for storage device labeling and operating system file reporting. The binary system (1 GiB = 1,024 MiB) is sometimes used in technical computing but is not the standard for consumer storage."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I estimate download time using this converter?",
          "answer": "First, convert GB to MB using this converter. Then, divide the result by your internet speed in MB/s (convert Mbps to MB/s by dividing by 8). For example, downloading 5 GB (5,000 MB) at 10 MB/s takes 500 seconds (about 8 minutes)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does my hard drive show less space than advertised?",
          "answer": "Storage devices lose capacity to file system overhead, system files, and formatting. A 1 TB (1,000 GB or 1,000,000 MB) device typically shows 900-950 GB of usable space. This is standard across all storage manufacturers and operating systems."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the total size of my photos if each is 5 MB and I have 1,000?",
          "answer": "Multiply: 1,000 × 5 MB = 5,000 MB, which converts to 5 GB. This converter helps you understand the total storage requirement for collections of files."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do storage tiers work in cloud services?",
          "answer": "Cloud providers offer storage in GB tiers (e.g., 100 GB, 200 GB, 1 TB). Understanding the MB equivalent helps you estimate how many files fit in each tier. For example, a 100 GB plan holds 100,000 MB of data."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the relationship between GB and TB?",
          "answer": "1 TB = 1,000 GB (which equals 1,000,000 MB). This hierarchical relationship makes it easy to convert between units by multiplying or dividing by 1,000 for each step."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I calculate backup time for large data sets?",
          "answer": "Convert GB to MB, then divide by your backup speed (in MB/s) to get time in seconds. For example, backing up 50 GB (50,000 MB) at 100 MB/s takes 500 seconds (about 8 minutes). This helps plan backup windows and storage allocation."
