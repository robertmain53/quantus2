      "introduction": [
        "This converter turns UK gallons (also called imperial gallons) into liters using the exact legal conversion factor, so you can move confidently between imperial and metric units.",
        "Use it whenever a volume is specified in UK gallons but you need liters instead, for example when comparing UK fuel economy figures, scaling brewing recipes, or reconciling historical engineering data with modern SI-based documentation.",
        "The underlying factor for 1 UK gallon in liters is fixed by UK law and international metrology practice, so as long as your original gallon value is correct and your instruments are properly calibrated, this tool will give you reproducible, standards-consistent results."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "The UK gallon used here is the imperial gallon defined by UK legislation and metrology guidance as exactly 4.54609 liters. This definition replaced older, inconsistent gallon variants and is the basis for modern imperial-to-metric conversion tables produced by national measurement institutes.",
        "To convert from UK gallons to liters, the calculator multiplies the input volume in UK gallons by 4.54609. For example, 2 UK gallons correspond to 2 × 4.54609 = 9.09218 liters, while 0.5 UK gallons correspond to 2.273045 liters.",
        "The converter applies this exact factor without rounding in the internal calculation. Displayed results may be rounded for readability, but you can safely carry more decimal places in technical work by copying the numeric output and applying your own significant-figure rules.",
        "The definition of the liter itself is tied to the cubic decimeter and the SI base unit of length, so expressing UK gallons in liters allows you to connect legacy imperial volumes directly to SI-based calculations, such as flow rates in liters per second or tank capacities in cubic meters."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Everyday reference: 1 UK gallon = 4.54609 liters. If a vehicle fuel tank is rated at 10 UK gallons, its capacity in liters is 10 × 4.54609 = 45.4609 liters.",
        "Example 2 – Recipe scaling: A brewing manual might specify 3 UK gallons of wort. In liters this is 3 × 4.54609 = 13.63827 liters, which you can round to 13.64 L for most practical purposes.",
        "Example 3 – Comparing to US gallons: Because 1 UK gallon is about 4.54609 liters while 1 US gallon is about 3.78541 liters, a UK gallon is roughly 20% larger. If you mistakenly treat a UK gallon value as US gallons, your liter result will be significantly underestimated.",
        "Example 4 – Back-of-the-envelope check: If you know a tank holds about 23 liters, dividing by 4.54609 gives roughly 5.06 UK gallons, which matches the intuition that five imperial gallons are a bit more than 22.7 liters."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What is the exact conversion from UK gallons to liters?",
          "answer": "By definition, 1 UK gallon (imperial gallon) is exactly 4.54609 liters. The converter multiplies any input in UK gallons by 4.54609 to give the corresponding volume in liters."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is a UK (imperial) gallon different from a US gallon?",
          "answer": "A UK gallon is larger than a US gallon. One UK gallon is defined as 4.54609 liters, while one US liquid gallon is about 3.78541 liters. That means a UK gallon is roughly 20% larger, so you should always check which gallon a specification is using before converting."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many decimal places should I keep in the liter result?",
          "answer": "For everyday uses such as cooking or rough fuel estimates, rounding to two decimal places in liters is usually sufficient. In engineering or lab work, you should keep as many significant figures as your measurements justify, often four to six significant digits, and document your rounding rules in technical reports."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this converter accurate enough for regulatory or laboratory work?",
          "answer": "Yes. The underlying factor of 4.54609 liters per UK gallon is the legally defined value used in official conversion tables produced by metrology institutes and governments. As long as your original gallon measurement is trustworthy and your instruments are calibrated to appropriate standards, the numerical conversion itself will not be the limiting source of error."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do some sources show 1 UK gallon as 4.55 liters instead of 4.54609?",
          "answer": "Values like 4.55 liters are just rounded approximations used for quick mental arithmetic. The legally defined, exact factor is 4.54609 liters per UK gallon. For serious technical, commercial, or regulatory work you should always use the exact value, which is what this converter uses internally."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I convert liters back to UK gallons with this information?",
          "answer": "Yes. To go from liters to UK gallons you divide by the same factor: UK gallons = liters ÷ 4.54609. Many systems also offer a companion liters-to-UK-gallons converter, but the underlying relationship is the same reciprocal of the exact definition."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where is the UK gallon still commonly encountered?",
          "answer": "The UK (imperial) gallon appears in older technical documentation, legacy engineering specifications, historical trade data, and some educational materials. Modern UK law requires metric units for most commercial uses, but understanding UK gallons is still important when interpreting historical records or comparing legacy imperial figures with current metric values."
