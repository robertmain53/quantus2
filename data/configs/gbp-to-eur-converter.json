    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a GBP amount into EUR using the exchange rate you provide or a live market rate. It also computes provider fees as a percentage and an optional fixed charge so you can see the net euros that will be received after costs.",
      "Exchange rates fluctuate continuously; authoritative reference values are published by central banks and international financial institutions. Use the exchange rate field to paste a real-time mid-market rate, or adjust it to match the bank or provider quote you received."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Gross EUR is calculated by multiplying the sterling amount by the exchange rate (EUR = GBP × rate).",
      "Fees are calculated in GBP as a percentage of the GBP amount plus any fixed GBP charge, then subtracted before converting to EUR to show the net amount delivered to the recipient.",
      "Where available, use official reference rates from the European Central Bank or the Bank of England for benchmarking. For final settlement amounts, use the exact rate and fee your payment provider quotes at execution time."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Gross EUR = amount_gbp × exchange_rate",
      "Fees (GBP) = amount_gbp × (fee_percent / 100) + fixed_fee_gbp",
      "Net EUR = (amount_gbp − Fees (GBP)) × exchange_rate"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Should I use the mid-market rate or the provider quote?",
        "answer": "Mid-market rates published by central banks are useful as benchmarks, but the actual rate you receive from a bank or money service often includes a spread. For settlement estimates, enter the provider's quoted rate and fees to see the accurate net amount."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do exchange rates change?",
        "answer": "Exchange rates move continuously during market hours due to supply and demand, macroeconomic data, and central bank actions. Reference rates are typically updated daily by central banks, while market rates can change by the second."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why subtract fees before converting?",
        "answer": "Some providers charge fees in the source currency (GBP). Subtracting fees first and then converting gives the actual euros the recipient will receive. If your provider deducts fees in EUR, enter that fee as an equivalent GBP amount in the fixed fee field."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this tool for settlement-level precision?",
        "answer": "This calculator is for estimation and planning. For final settlement values use the exact execution rate, interbank charges, and timestamps your payment provider supplies. Regulatory or tax reporting should rely on official confirmations and statements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards inform currency code and reporting?",
        "answer": "Currency identifiers follow ISO 4217. Central bank publications and international bodies such as the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund provide guidance and reference rates used in reporting and reconciliation."
