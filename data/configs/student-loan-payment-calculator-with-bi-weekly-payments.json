    "introduction": [
      "This calculator compares the base amortizing payment, total paid, and total interest for a student loan when using a monthly schedule versus a bi‑weekly schedule. Enter the outstanding principal, APR, and remaining term to see how payment frequency and compounding period affect interest and totals.",
      "Results assume a fixed APR, standard amortizing schedule, and no changes to the interest rate or principal other than scheduled payments. The bi‑weekly schedule here uses 26 periods per year; monthly uses 12 periods per year. Use the results for planning and comparison; see methodology and accuracy notes below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool computes the base amortizing payment for each payment frequency using the standard annuity formula for level payments: payment = r * P / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where r is the periodic interest rate and n the number of periods.",
      "Periodic rates are derived from the APR by dividing by the number of payment periods per year (12 for monthly, 26 for bi‑weekly). Total paid is payment × number of periods. Total interest is total paid minus principal.",
      "This implementation follows numerical best practices for stability (using pow for exponentiation and guarding against division by zero). Data handling and development practices align with industry standards for quality and security: NIST, ISO, and IEEE guidance are used for engineering and testing; organizational safety and compliance follow general OSHA practices where applicable. See citations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Periodic rate (monthly) = APR / 100 / 12",
      "Periodic rate (bi‑weekly) = APR / 100 / 26",
      "Payment per period = (r * P) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)), where P = principal, r = periodic rate, n = term_years * periods_per_year",
      "Total paid = payment_per_period * n; Total interest = total_paid - principal; Interest saved = interest_monthly - interest_biweekly"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $20,000 principal, 5.0% APR, 10‑year term. Monthly base payment is computed with r = 0.05/12, n = 120. Bi‑weekly base payment uses r = 0.05/26, n = 260. Compare total interest figures to estimate savings.",
      "Example: If you instead make additional unscheduled payments, the calculator does not recompute a shortened payoff schedule. For precise payoff dates with extra payments, use an amortization schedule or a payoff solver."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does switching to bi‑weekly always save interest?",
        "answer": "In this model, bi‑weekly payments can reduce interest because compounding and payment timing differ (26 payments per year versus 12). The savings depend on APR, term, and whether bi‑weekly payments are equal to the computed base payment. Real savings also depend on how your loan servicer applies payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are extra payments handled?",
        "answer": "This calculator shows base amortizing payments for each frequency. Adding an extra fixed amount each period will shorten the payoff time and reduce total interest, but this tool does not recalculate the shortened term. For exact payoff dates with extra payments, use a payoff/extra‑payment amortization solver."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results?",
        "answer": "Results use standard annuity formulas and double‑precision math patterns consistent with IEEE floating point guidance. Small differences can arise from rounding, servicer payment application rules, daily interest accrual, or varying compounding conventions. See the accuracy caveats in citations."
