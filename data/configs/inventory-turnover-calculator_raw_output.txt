1. This is a simple_calc because inventory turnover is computed from multiple user inputs (cost of goods sold plus inventory values) to produce one primary financial ratio (and a related secondary metric), so a formula-based calculator with a form is required.

2. I will use component_type: 'simple_calc' with logic.type: 'formula'.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples[]). No nested objects for copy.

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown, no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, schema_org, open_graph, meta, or arbitrary UI/layout fields). The form object will be used because this is a simple_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
