      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms modern watt ratings to traditional BTU per hour, enabling HVAC system understanding.",
        "Modern equipment specifies power in watts while traditional HVAC uses BTU/h.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where 1 watt equals approximately 3.412 BTU/h."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 W ≈ 3.412 BTU/h. To convert watts to BTU/h, multiply by 3.412.",
        "Understanding watt to BTU/h conversion helps evaluate heating and cooling system capacity.",
        "HVAC professionals use both units; conversion enables clear communication.",
        "This converter provides accurate power conversion for heating/cooling planning."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Electric heater: 1,000 watts ≈ 3,412 BTU/h.",
        "Example 2 – Standard air conditioner: 2,000 watts ≈ 6,824 BTU/h.",
        "Example 3 – Large HVAC system: 5,000 watts ≈ 17,060 BTU/h."

        {
          "question": "How do I interpret AC unit specifications?",
          "answer": "AC rated in BTU/h (cooling capacity) and watts (power consumption). Higher BTU/h = greater cooling."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the relationship between heating and cooling?",
          "answer": "Heat pump: same system heats/cools. Furnace+AC: separate heating and cooling systems."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does running AC cost?",
          "answer": "Cost = (watts ÷ 1000) × hours × $/kWh. Example: 3,000W × 8hr × $0.12/kWh = $2.88/day."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does AC consume more power than heating?",
          "answer": "AC compressor is energy-intensive. Heat pumps are more efficient than resistance heating."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is peak demand?",
          "answer": "Maximum power usage at any instant. Utilities may charge more for peak demand."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can solar panels power my AC?",
          "answer": "Possible with enough panels. 5kW AC needs ~15-20kW solar system (accounting for efficiency)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's an inverter and do I need one?",
          "answer": "Converts DC power to AC. Needed if using batteries/solar. Standard grid: not needed."

        {
          "question": "How do I reduce HVAC energy use?",
          "answer": "Programmable thermostat, proper insulation, regular maintenance, Energy Star equipment."
