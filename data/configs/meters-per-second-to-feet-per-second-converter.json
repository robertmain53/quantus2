    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a single speed value expressed in meters per second (m/s) to feet per second (ft/s). The relationship is a fixed, dimension-based conversion between SI and imperial units and does not require any additional inputs.",
      "Use this tool for engineering calculations, data reporting, unit checks, or quick field conversions. For regulated measurement, follow calibration and uncertainty procedures described below before using converted values for compliance or safety decisions."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies the exact linear conversion between the units based on the international definition of the metre and the foot. The conversion factor is derived from official unit definitions maintained by national and international standards organizations.",
      "Reported results can be rounded to an appropriate number of significant digits. Selection of rounding should reflect the resolution and uncertainty of the measurement instrument and the requirements of applicable standards such as ISO and NIST guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Multiply the value in meters per second by the conversion factor: feet per second = meters per second × 3.280839895.",
      "To convert back: meters per second = feet per second ÷ 3.280839895.",
      "Choose reporting precision consistent with instrument resolution and uncertainty budgeting. For many engineering tasks, 3 to 6 significant digits are typical."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 5 m/s × 3.280839895 = 16.404199475 ft/s, typically reported as 16.4042 ft/s (rounded to 5 significant figures).",
      "Example 2: 0.1 m/s × 3.280839895 = 0.3280839895 ft/s, typically reported as 0.32808 ft/s when instrument resolution supports 5 significant figures."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This is a direct unit conversion with a constant multiplier. Verify the number of significant digits you report based on instrument accuracy and applicable standards.",
      "For compliance or safety-critical uses, ensure instruments are calibrated and record measurement uncertainty per recognized standards before using converted values."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between m/s and ft/s?",
        "answer": "One metre equals 3.2808398950131 feet under the international definitions. The converter uses the standard multiplier 3.280839895 for practical precision; for extra precision use the extended value from standards references."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Match reporting precision to the least precise element in your measurement chain. For laboratory and engineering work, 3 to 6 significant digits are common. For compliance, follow the precision requirements in the applicable standard or specification."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the conversion depend on temperature, pressure, or location?",
        "answer": "No. The conversion between meters and feet is a defined unit relationship and is not affected by environmental conditions. Measurement of speed may be influenced by instrument performance or environmental factors; include those effects in uncertainty analysis."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for safety-critical or regulatory reporting?",
        "answer": "You can use this conversion as part of reporting, but for safety-critical or regulatory submissions validate instrument calibration and uncertainty per recognized standards (for example ISO/IEC 17025 and guidance from NIST or relevant regulatory bodies) before final reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert m/s to other common units like mph or ft/min?",
        "answer": "First convert m/s to ft/s using the multiplier 3.280839895. Then apply the appropriate factor to the target unit (for example, 1 ft/s = 0.6818181818 mph or 1 ft/s = 60 ft/min)."
