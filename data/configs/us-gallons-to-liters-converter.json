    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms volume measurements from US Gallons to Liters, enabling fuel and liquid volume understanding.",
      "The US gallon is used for fuel in the US while most of the world uses liters. Understanding the conversion is essential.",
      "This converter uses the standard relationship where 1 US gallon equals approximately 3.78541 liters."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "1 US gallon ≈ 3.78541 liters. To convert gallons to liters, multiply by 3.78541. For example, 1 gal ≈ 3.79 L, 10 gal ≈ 37.9 L.",
      "Fuel economy is measured in miles per gallon in the US but liters per 100 km elsewhere. Converting enables comparison.",
      "Cooking recipes use different volume measurements depending on region. Understanding conversions helps with recipe scaling.",
      "This converter provides precise volume conversions for culinary and fuel contexts."
