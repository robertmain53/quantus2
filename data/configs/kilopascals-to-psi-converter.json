    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a single numeric pressure expressed in kilopascals (kPa) into pounds per square inch (psi). The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship between two units: the SI-derived kilopascal and the imperial-derived psi.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit changes when reading gauges, specifying design pressures, or recording measurements for reports. For regulated or safety-critical work, review calibration, measurement uncertainty, and whether the pressure is gauge or absolute before relying on a converted value.",
      "Results are presented as mathematical conversions only. They do not replace calibrated measurement devices, traceable calibration certificates, or compliance checks required by standards and regulators."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the exact relationship between the units: 1 psi equals 6.894757293177... kilopascals. Conversion is performed with full double-precision and then rounded for display according to common engineering practice.",
      "Be mindful of whether your original pressure is gauge (relative to ambient) or absolute (relative to vacuum); converting the number from kPa to psi does not change its reference. If you need absolute-to-gauge or gauge-to-absolute conversions, add or subtract local atmospheric pressure before or after unit conversion.",
      "For safety-critical, legal, or compliance work consult applicable standards and calibration procedures. Calibration traceable to national metrology institutes and uncertainty statements are required by ISO/IEC 17025 and recommended by NIST guidance for measurement accuracy."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: psi = kPa / 6.894757293177",
      "Alternate formula: psi = kPa × 0.14503773773020923",
      "Steps: 1) Confirm numeric value is in kPa and note whether it is gauge or absolute. 2) Apply formula. 3) Round to appropriate significant figures based on instrument uncertainty and reporting rules."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 kPa converts using 100 / 6.894757293177 = 14.5037738 psi (report as 14.504 psi for four significant digits)",
      "101.325 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure) converts as 101.325 / 6.894757293177 = 14.6959488 psi (≈ 14.6959 psi)",
      "220 kPa converts as 220 / 6.894757293177 = 31.9083024 psi (≈ 31.9083 psi)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Converting kPa to psi is a fixed arithmetic operation using the constant 6.894757293177 kPa per psi.",
      "Always confirm gauge vs absolute reference and account for measurement uncertainty and calibration when conversions are used for engineering, safety, or compliance decisions."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion affected by temperature or gas type?",
        "answer": "The numeric relationship between kPa and psi is a unit conversion and is not directly affected by temperature or gas composition. However, measured pressure can change with temperature and fluid properties, so ensure the measured quantity is appropriate before converting units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I convert gauge pressure or absolute pressure?",
        "answer": "Convert whichever numeric value you have. If you need to compare or combine pressures, first ensure all values share the same reference (gauge or absolute). To convert from gauge to absolute, add local atmospheric pressure (for example, ≈101.325 kPa at sea level) before converting units."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I report?",
        "answer": "Report decimals based on the measurement instrument's uncertainty and the needs of the task. For many engineering tasks, three to four significant figures are common. For compliance or calibration records follow the precision specified in the relevant standard or procedure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this converter for legal or safety-critical records?",
        "answer": "This converter provides numeric unit conversions only. For legal, safety, or regulatory records, use measurements from calibrated instruments with traceable calibration certificates and include uncertainty statements per ISO/IEC 17025 and applicable regulatory requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find authoritative guidance on units and measurement best practices?",
        "answer": "Authoritative guidance includes national measurement institute publications and international standards such as NIST publications and ISO standards. For laboratory accreditation and calibration procedures consult ISO/IEC 17025 and related guidance documents."
