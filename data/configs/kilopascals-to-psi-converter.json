To convert kPa to PSI, divide by 6.89476. For example, 100 kPa ≈ 14.5 PSI, 200 kPa ≈ 29 PSI.","Tire pressure specifications often use both kPa (common in metric countries) and PSI (common in imperial).","Equipment manuals may specify pressures in either unit depending on manufacturer origin.","This converter provides precise pressure conversions for maintenance and equipment specification."],"examples":["Example 1 – Tire pressure: 220 kPa equals approximately 32 PSI.","Example 2 – Compressor: A 700 kPa system pressure is approximately 102 PSI.","Example 3 – Hydraulic system: 5,000 kPa pressure is approximately 725 PSI."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from Kilopascals to PSI?","answer":"1 PSI ≈ 6.89476 kPa.
