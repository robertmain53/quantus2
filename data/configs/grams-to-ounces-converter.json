    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts mass values from grams to ounces using the international avoirdupois definition. It is intended for general-purpose use in cooking, laboratory notes, shipping estimations, and quick unit checks.",
      "Results are given using the internationally agreed fixed relationship between the avoirdupois ounce and the gram. For high-precision or legally regulated weighing, follow calibration and compliance guidance in the methodology and citations below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The avoirdupois ounce is defined by international agreement as exactly 1/16 of an avoirdupois pound, where 1 avoirdupois pound is exactly 0.45359237 kilograms. That yields an exact relation of 1 avoirdupois ounce = 28.349523125 grams.",
      "This tool applies that fixed mathematical relationship for conversion. It does not perform adjustments for local measurement laws, humidity, scale tare, or bulk density effects.",
      "For regulated measurements, verification and calibration should follow NIST publications and relevant ISO standards such as ISO/IEC 17025 for laboratory calibration and ISO 80000 for quantities and units. Follow workplace measurement and safety rules from applicable OSHA guidance when weighing in occupational settings."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Exact relationship used: 1 avoirdupois ounce = 28.349523125 grams.",
      "To convert grams to ounces: ounces = grams ÷ 28.349523125.",
      "To convert ounces to grams (for verification): grams = ounces × 28.349523125.",
      "Rounding: present results to a reasonable number of significant digits for the context (for cooking 2–3 decimal places; for laboratory reporting follow instrument resolution and calibration certificate)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 grams ÷ 28.349523125 = 3.5273961947 → commonly reported as 3.5274 ounces.",
      "50 grams ÷ 28.349523125 = 1.7636980974 → commonly reported as 1.7637 ounces.",
      "0.5 ounce × 28.349523125 = 14.1747615625 grams → reported as 14.1748 grams when needed."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use this converter for fast, deterministic conversions between grams and avoirdupois ounces based on the exact international definition.",
      "For legal, commercial, or laboratory-critical measurements, always rely on calibrated instruments, documented procedures, and the relevant standards cited below."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion suitable for precious metals such as gold?",
        "answer": "No. Precious metals commonly use the troy ounce, which is different: 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. This converter uses the avoirdupois ounce (1 oz = 28.349523125 g). Use a troy-ounce-specific converter for bullion and precious-metal work."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I trust in the result?",
        "answer": "Trust digits within the measurement device resolution and calibration uncertainty. For kitchen use, 2–4 significant digits are normally sufficient. For laboratory or trade measurements, report according to the instrument's calibrated uncertainty and the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 or local regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for scale tare, buoyancy, or environmental effects?",
        "answer": "No. This is a pure mathematical unit conversion. Buoyancy corrections, tare adjustments, and environmental effects must be applied separately according to the weighing procedure and standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where does the conversion factor come from?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor arises from the international definition of the avoirdupois pound and international SI definitions. The resulting exact value used here is 28.349523125 grams per avoirdupois ounce."
      },
      {
        "question": "What standards should I consult for calibration and legal measurements?",
        "answer": "Consult NIST publications for weights and measures, the BIPM SI brochure for unit definitions, ISO/IEC 17025 for calibration laboratory competence, and any local legal metrology regulations. OSHA provides workplace safety requirements that may apply during weighing operations."
