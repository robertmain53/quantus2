    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms mass given in grams to ounces using the fixed mathematical relationship between metric and imperial mass units. It assumes the common avoirdupois ounce unless otherwise specified.",
      "Use this tool for recipes, shipping estimates, laboratory notes, or quick unit checks. For legal trade, laboratory, or regulatory measurement work consult local standards and ensure instruments are calibrated to applicable specifications."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally recognised exact relationship between the gram and the avoirdupois ounce. The tool applies a fixed multiplicative factor so results are deterministic and reversible.",
      "When high accuracy is required (scientific, legal-for-trade, or regulated contexts), the converter output should be cross-checked against a calibrated scale and rounding practices consistent with the controlling standard or regulation."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: ounces = grams × 0.03527396195",
      "Inverse formula: grams = ounces × 28.349523125",
      "Steps: 1) Accept numeric input in grams. 2) Multiply by the conversion factor above. 3) Apply appropriate rounding for the intended use (see FAQs)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "100 grams → 100 × 0.03527396195 = 3.527396195 ounces (round as required)",
      "28.349523125 grams → 1.000000000 ounces (definitionally equal for avoirdupois ounce)",
      "450 grams → 15.8732828775 ounces → typically displayed as 15.87 oz for two-decimal consumer use"
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which ounce does this converter use?",
        "answer": "This converter uses the avoirdupois ounce, the standard ounce for everyday mass (1 ounce = 28.349523125 grams). It does not convert to troy ounces, which are used for precious metals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For recipes, 1–2 decimals are usually sufficient. For laboratory data or legal measurements follow the rounding and significant-figure rules in the applicable standard or regulation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The relationship between grams and avoirdupois ounces used here is exact by definition of the units. Practical accuracy depends on the precision of your input and the calibration of measurement instruments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a calibrated scale for official measurements?",
        "answer": "Yes. For regulatory, trade, laboratory, or medical purposes use a calibrated balance and follow the calibration intervals and procedures required by standards such as NIST Handbook 44 and applicable ISO specifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What environmental or equipment factors affect real-world measurement accuracy?",
        "answer": "Temperature, air buoyancy, vibration, and improper zeroing can all influence measured mass. Use instruments within their specified operating conditions and apply corrections where required by the measurement standard in use."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there legal or safety regulations I should consider?",
        "answer": "Workplace safety, labeling, or trade measurements may be governed by local and international rules. Consult OSHA or equivalent workplace safety guidance for handling mass-related hazards and NIST/ISO documents for measurement and trade compliance."
