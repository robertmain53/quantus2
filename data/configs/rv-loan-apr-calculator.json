    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates periodic payments and total interest for an RV loan using the APR you provide. It supports monthly, semi‑monthly, bi‑weekly and weekly payment schedules and allows an optional balloon (final lump sum) payment.",
      "Results assume APR is the nominal annual rate expressed in percent and that payments are level and scheduled evenly by the selected frequency. Use the down payment and trade‑in fields to reduce the financed amount; include fees if they are rolled into the loan."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We convert the annual percentage rate (APR) to a periodic rate by dividing APR by the number of payments per year, then apply the standard level‑payment amortization formula to compute each periodic payment. If a balloon amount is entered, it is added to the final period and shown separately.",
      "Formulas are implemented to produce a single consistent amortization result for the chosen payment frequency. This tool does not estimate lender fees beyond those you enter, nor does it compute taxes or insurance.",
      "Accuracy and security guidance: numerical accuracy follows common engineering practice for financial calculators and conservative rounding. For data handling and system security, follow NIST guidance for secure computations and ISO/IEC recommendations for quality management. The results are estimates only and not legal disclosures required by consumer finance regulations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Amount financed = purchase price − down payment − trade‑in + fees",
      "Periodic rate = APR / 100 / (payments per year)",
      "Payment = periodic_rate == 0 ? financed_amount / periods : (financed_amount * periodic_rate) / (1 − (1 + periodic_rate)^(−periods))",
      "Total paid = payment × periods + balloon_amount",
      "Total interest = total paid − financed amount"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: $50,000 RV, $5,000 down, 6.5% APR, 10 years, bi‑weekly (26). Calculator returns the bi‑weekly payment amount, total interest over the loan, and total amount paid including any balloon.",
      "Example 2: Same loan but switch frequency to monthly (12) to compare payment sizes and total interest; bi‑weekly schedules often reduce interest slightly because of increased payment frequency for the same APR and term."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator compute the lender's disclosed APR under Truth in Lending?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the APR you enter to compute periodic payments. It does not compute or certify the legally disclosed APR a lender must provide under Truth in Lending rules. For binding disclosures, rely on the lender's written statement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I enter nominal APR, APR with compounding, or APR including fees?",
        "answer": "Enter the APR as provided by your lender. If the lender has rolled fees into the financed amount, include them in the 'fees' field instead. This calculator treats APR as a nominal annual rate converted to a periodic rate; it does not perform separate effective APR conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does bi‑weekly reduce interest?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly schedules double the number of payments per year (usually 26). For the same APR and term in years this increases payment frequency which can slightly reduce the outstanding principal sooner and therefore total interest. The exact effect depends on how the lender applies payments and interest; some lenders apply a bi‑weekly plan by splitting monthly payments instead."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the result exact for my loan?",
        "answer": "Results are estimates. Lenders may use different day‑count conventions, compounding rules, rounding and apply payments on different schedules. Use this calculator for planning and comparison, and verify final numbers with your lender's amortization schedule."
