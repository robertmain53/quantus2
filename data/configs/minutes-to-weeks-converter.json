    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct unit conversion from minutes to weeks using the standard time definitions. It is intended for scheduling, reporting, analytics, and general unit-conversion tasks where weeks are defined as seven 24-hour days.",
      "Results are computed from a fixed mathematical relationship and are exact under that definition; they do not incorporate calendar-specific items such as months, years, or variable-length days. Use the rounding guidance below when preparing outputs for regulatory or official reports.",
      "If you need conversion tied to calendars, payroll cycles, or legal timekeeping (for example, accounting for workweek definitions or overtime rules), confirm requirements with the authoritative standard or regulator cited in the references."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter uses the immutable chain of base time units: 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1 day = 24 hours, and 1 week = 7 days. Combine these to get 1 week = 7 × 24 × 60 = 10,080 minutes.",
      "The calculation is a single-step division of the input minutes by 10,080. No lookups, heuristics, or external data sources are used in the numeric conversion itself.",
      "For reporting and compliance, apply rounding rules required by the relevant authority or policy. This tool documents authoritative references (NIST, ISO, IEEE, OSHA) to help you align rounding and notation with standards and workplace regulations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core formula: weeks = minutes ÷ 10,080.",
      "Validation steps: (1) ensure the input is a numeric value representing total minutes, (2) treat negative inputs only if your workflow allows (this converter will mathematically convert them but negative time may be invalid for reporting), (3) divide by 10,080 and format/round according to your needs.",
      "Example calculation: 20,160 minutes ÷ 10,080 = 2 weeks. For fractional weeks, express results as a decimal or convert the fractional part into days/hours/minutes as needed."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Input: 15,120 minutes → 15,120 ÷ 10,080 = 1.5 → Output: 1.5 weeks (one and a half weeks).",
      "Input: 525,600 minutes → 525,600 ÷ 10,080 = 52.142857142857146 → Output: 52.142857 weeks (52 weeks and 1 day).",
      "Input: 0 minutes → 0 ÷ 10,080 = 0 → Output: 0 weeks."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact definition of a week does this tool use?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the standard civil definition of a week as seven days of 24 hours each, yielding 10,080 minutes per week. This is the fixed mathematical definition used for unit conversions and for most scheduling calculations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the converter account for daylight saving time or leap seconds?",
        "answer": "No. Daylight saving time and leap seconds affect clock readings and time-of-day calculations but do not change the fixed unit relationship used here. For applications where DST or leap seconds matter (precision timing or legal timestamps), consult the relevant timekeeping standards and instrumentation guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result for regulatory reporting or payroll?",
        "answer": "Rounding rules depend on the regulator or internal policy. For payroll and safety reporting, follow your organization's policy or the applicable regulation (for example, rules referenced by labor authorities). When in doubt, document the rounding rule used and cite the applicable standard or policy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for legal, safety, or medical certificates?",
        "answer": "This converter provides numeric unit conversion only and is not a certified instrument. For legal, safety, medical, or regulatory submission you should verify calculations against official methods, use calibrated tools where required, and follow the applicable standards and reporting rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "What precision can I expect from the conversion?",
        "answer": "The mathematical conversion is exact in rational arithmetic (minutes ÷ 10,080). Display precision depends on the numeric format you choose (decimal places, significant figures). Be mindful of floating-point representation when exporting results to other systems and apply rounding per your accuracy requirements."
