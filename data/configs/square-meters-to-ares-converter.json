    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts area values between square meters (m²) and ares (a). The relationship is exact by definition: 1 are equals 100 square meters.",
      "Ares are a metric area unit commonly used for land measurement in parts of Europe and agriculture. While the are is not a base SI unit, it is accepted for use with the International System of Units; the hectare (100 ares) is more commonly used for larger areas.",
      "Results are exact mathematically; use the guidance below for rounding, reporting for legal surveys, and when instrument measurement uncertainty matters."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion derives from the metric definition of the are: 1 a = 100 m². This is an exact ratio based on metric prefixes (hecto = 100).",
      "To convert square meters to ares, divide the area in square meters by 100. To convert ares to square meters, multiply by 100.",
      "For practical measurement and reporting, consider instrument uncertainty (survey GPS, total stations, cadastral records) and local regulatory requirements that may mandate a specific unit or rounding rules. For metrological standards and accepted units see national measurement institute guidance."

      "Exact definitions used:",
      "1 are (a) = 100 square meters (m²).",
      "Square meters to ares: a = m² ÷ 100.",
      "Ares to square meters: m² = a × 100.",
      "Example numeric conversion: 250 m² → 250 ÷ 100 = 2.5 a."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 1,000 m²: 1000 ÷ 100 = 10 a.",
      "Convert 47.5 m²: 47.5 ÷ 100 = 0.475 a."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is an are and how does it relate to the hectare?",
        "answer": "An are (symbol: a) is a metric area unit equal to 100 m². A hectare (ha) equals 100 ares or 10,000 m². The hectare is the more commonly used unit for large land areas, while the are is convenient for smaller plots."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the are an official SI unit?",
        "answer": "The are is not an SI base unit, but it is accepted for use with the International System of Units (SI) for practical measurements of area. For authoritative unit policy consult national measurement institutes and the SI brochure."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I keep when converting?",
        "answer": "Mathematically the conversion is exact, but display precision depends on use case. For planning and publishing, two decimal places (0.01 a) are typical for small plots; cadastral or legal documents may require specific rounding—always follow local registry or surveyor guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this conversion for cadastral or legal surveys?",
        "answer": "You can convert between units for reference, but final legal area for property transactions should follow local cadastral regulations and certified survey measurements. Measurement uncertainty, datum, and instrument calibration must be considered; consult your national cadastral authority or a licensed surveyor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does instrument accuracy affect the conversion?",
        "answer": "The numeric conversion is exact, but the measured value in square meters carries instrument and method uncertainty (GPS, total station, photogrammetry). Report converted results with uncertainty or rounding consistent with the measurement method and any regulatory requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert very large areas?",
        "answer": "For very large areas prefer hectares or square kilometers for readability: 1 ha = 100 a = 10,000 m²; 1 km² = 1,000,000 m² = 10,000 a. Convert m² to a first (divide by 100), then to hectares by dividing by 100 again if useful."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regional differences in using ares?",
        "answer": "Usage varies by country. Some jurisdictions prefer hectares or square meters in official contexts. Always verify local conventions for land measurement and reporting with the relevant government authority."
