    "introduction": [
      "This calculator converts a per-payment dividend amount into an annual dividend, computes the current dividend yield using the current share price, estimates annual income for your holdings, and computes yield on cost when a cost basis is provided.",
      "Use the payment frequency selector to reflect how often dividends are paid (annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly). Results are illustrative and rely on the inputs you provide; they do not constitute investment advice."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Annual dividend is annualized by multiplying the reported per-payment dividend by the number of payments per year.",
      "Dividend yield (current) is calculated as annual dividend divided by current market price, expressed as a percentage.",
      "Annual income is the annual dividend multiplied by the number of shares you own.",
      "Yield on cost divides the annual dividend by the cost basis per share you specify; yield on cost is only meaningful when a positive cost basis is provided."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Annual dividend = dividend_per_payment × payments_per_year",
      "Dividend yield (%) = (Annual dividend / Current price per share) × 100",
      "Annual income = Annual dividend × Shares owned",
      "Yield on cost (%) = (Annual dividend / Cost basis per share) × 100"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: A stock pays $0.25 per quarter (4 payments). Annual dividend = 0.25 × 4 = $1.00. If price = $25.00 then dividend yield = (1.00 / 25.00) × 100 = 4.00%.",
      "Example 2: If you own 200 shares with annual dividend $1.00, estimated annual income = 1.00 × 200 = $200. If cost basis per share = $20.00 then yield on cost = (1.00 / 20.00) × 100 = 5.00%."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Enter the per-payment dividend, select payment frequency, and provide price and share count to see annualized dividend, current yield, and estimated income.",
      "Provide cost basis only if you want yield on cost; if cost basis is zero or omitted, yield on cost cannot be computed reliably."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is dividend yield?",
        "answer": "Dividend yield is the annual dividend per share divided by the current share price, expressed as a percentage. It shows the income return relative to price, not total return."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use trailing or forward dividends?",
        "answer": "This tool annualizes the per-payment dividend you enter. To compute trailing yield, enter the most recent trailing per-payment amount and appropriate frequency. For forward yield, enter the declared forward per-payment amount. Always label your input accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my cost basis is zero or not provided?",
        "answer": "Yield on cost divides by the cost basis per share. If cost basis is zero or not entered, yield on cost is undefined; review inputs before relying on that output."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these results?",
        "answer": "Calculations are algebraic and precise within typical floating-point limits. Results depend on the accuracy and timeliness of your inputs. We follow quality and security guidance consistent with ISO management standards and information security best practices, and recommend cross-checking with market data sources."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this investment advice?",
        "answer": "No. This tool provides numeric calculations only and is not financial or tax advice. Consult a licensed professional for investment decisions."
