    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms temperature from Celsius to Rankine, essential for thermodynamic calculations and engineering applications.",
      "Rankine is an absolute temperature scale like Kelvin, but uses Fahrenheit degree intervals. It's used in American engineering and some thermodynamics work.",
      "This converter uses the relationship where °R = (°C + 273.15) × 9/5."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Rankine is an absolute temperature scale (no negative values). Zero Rankine equals absolute zero (-273.15°C).",
      "To convert Celsius to Rankine: °R = (°C + 273.15) × 1.8. This combines the Celsius-to-Kelvin shift with the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit scale conversion.",
      "Engineering thermodynamics often uses Rankine because it maintains Fahrenheit degree size while providing absolute zero reference.",
      "This converter provides precise temperature conversions for engineering and scientific applications."

    "examples": [
      "Example 1 – Room temperature: 20°C = 527.67°R (approximately 528°R).",
      "Example 2 – Boiling water: 100°C = 671.67°R (approximately 672°R).",
      "Example 3 – Absolute zero: -273.15°C = 0°R (exact)."
