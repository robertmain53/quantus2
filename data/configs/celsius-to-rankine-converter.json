    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a temperature value given in degrees Celsius (°C) to degrees Rankine (°R), an absolute scale used primarily in some engineering fields. Rankine uses the same degree size as Fahrenheit but has its zero at absolute zero, so conversions require both an offset and a scale factor.",
      "Use this tool for quick conversions, checks during calculations, and to prepare values for systems or documentation that specify Rankine. For compliance, safety limits, or measurements used in certification, pair conversions with calibrated instrumentation and report measurement uncertainty per referenced standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Rankine is an absolute temperature scale related to Kelvin by a constant scale factor: 1 K = 1.8 °R. To convert from Celsius, first shift by the Kelvin offset (add 273.15) then convert the Kelvin value to Rankine by multiplying by 9/5.",
      "This converter applies the fixed mathematical relationship between Celsius and Rankine. It does not attempt to correct for sensor error, calibration offsets, or measurement uncertainty; those must be handled at the instrument or procedural level following recognized standards.",
      "For regulatory or safety applications, follow the measurement, calibration, and reporting guidance from standards bodies such as NIST, ISO and IEEE, and apply occupational guidelines (for example those from OSHA) when translating temperatures to action thresholds."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: °R = (°C + 273.15) × 9/5",
      "Step 1: Add 273.15 to the Celsius value to convert to Kelvin.",
      "Step 2: Multiply the Kelvin value by 9/5 (or 1.8) to obtain Rankine."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0 °C → (0 + 273.15) × 9/5 = 491.67 °R",
      "25 °C → (25 + 273.15) × 9/5 = 536.67 °R",
      "100 °C → (100 + 273.15) × 9/5 = 671.67 °R",
      "-273.15 °C → (−273.15 + 273.15) × 9/5 = 0.00 °R (absolute zero)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use °R = (°C + 273.15) × 9/5 for direct, exact mathematical conversion.",
      "Round results to an appropriate number of significant digits for your application and document instrument calibration and uncertainty when values are used for compliance, safety decisions, or certification."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is Rankine and when is it used?",
        "answer": "Rankine is an absolute temperature scale where zero equals absolute zero and one Rankine degree equals one Fahrenheit degree. It is commonly used in some engineering and thermodynamic contexts in the United States and legacy engineering documents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get negative Rankine values?",
        "answer": "No. Because Rankine is an absolute scale anchored at absolute zero, valid physical temperatures expressed in Rankine are zero or positive. A Celsius input of −273.15 °C converts to 0 °R."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimals should I report?",
        "answer": "Report decimals according to the precision of the original measurement and the requirements of your application. For many engineering tasks two decimal places are sufficient, but regulated measurements should include an uncertainty statement following NIST/ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for sensor calibration or uncertainty?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a pure mathematical unit conversion. For traceable measurements, use calibrated instruments and follow calibration and uncertainty procedures defined by NIST, ISO, and relevant IEEE standards; record calibration certificates and uncertainty budgets as required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Rankine the same as Kelvin?",
        "answer": "No. Kelvin and Rankine are both absolute temperature scales, but they use different degree sizes. 1 K equals 1.8 °R. Convert between them by using the scale factor 9/5 (or 1.8)."
