1. This is a converter because the user intent is to convert a single monetary unit (USD) to another unit (BTC) with one input producing one output; it fits the one-value unit conversion pattern.

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[].

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown or HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for converters, no canonical_url, no robots, no styling or extra metadata).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
