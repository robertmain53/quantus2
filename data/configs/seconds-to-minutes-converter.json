    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a numeric value in seconds to minutes using the exact mathematical relationship that 60 seconds equals 1 minute. It is intended for everyday use, engineering checks, and quick time calculations.",
      "The output is a simple numeric value in minutes. For users needing minutes with remaining seconds or an HH:MM:SS representation, see the examples and methodology sections for a remainder method and rounding guidance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion uses the fixed ratio 1 minute = 60 seconds. This is a pure unit conversion with no empirically measured factors, so the conversion is exact in mathematical terms: minutes = seconds / 60.",
      "For display and downstream use, this tool documents rounding conventions, how to compute minute+seconds remainder, and caveats for high-precision timekeeping where standards such as NIST time references, ISO 8601 formatting, or IEEE time-synchronization protocols apply."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Basic formula: minutes = seconds / 60",
      "Integer minutes with leftover seconds: minutes = floor(seconds / 60); leftover seconds = seconds mod 60",
      "To convert back: seconds = minutes × 60"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "90 seconds → 1.5 minutes",
      "75 seconds → 1 minute and 15 seconds (1 + 15/60 = 1.25 minutes)",
      "3600 seconds → 60 minutes"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This is an exact mathematical conversion based on the constant 60 seconds per minute. Use integer division and modulus if you need minutes with leftover seconds. For timestamp formatting or high-precision timing, follow applicable timekeeping and synchronization standards."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. Mathematically the relationship is exact: 1 minute = 60 seconds, so minutes = seconds divided by 60. Any inexactness comes from numeric rounding when displaying results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the result for display?",
        "answer": "Choose a display precision appropriate to your use case. For human-readable durations, two decimal places or showing minutes plus leftover seconds is common. For engineering or billing use-cases, follow the rounding rules required by your policy or standard; always document the chosen rounding method."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get minutes plus remaining seconds (e.g., 125 s → 2 min 5 s)?",
        "answer": "Compute integer minutes as floor(seconds / 60) and leftover seconds as seconds mod 60. To express as decimal minutes, divide seconds by 60 and present the desired number of decimal places."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are negative values allowed?",
        "answer": "Negative values are mathematically valid and convert the same way (negative minutes = negative seconds / 60). Interpret negative durations according to your application context."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about leap seconds and high-precision timekeeping?",
        "answer": "This converter handles pure arithmetic conversion only. For timekeeping that must account for leap seconds, synchronization offsets, or legal timestamps, consult authoritative time standards and synchronization protocols such as those published by NIST and IEEE."
