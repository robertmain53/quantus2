To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60. For example, 60 sec = 1 min, 120 sec = 2 min.","Many devices and activities are timed in seconds (stopwatches, microwave timers) but durations are expressed in minutes.","Converting seconds to minutes helps interpret timer readings and plan activities.","This converter provides precise time conversions for practical and scientific applications."],"examples":["Example 1 – Cooking: A microwave timer set for 300 seconds equals 5 minutes.","Example 2 – Exercise: A 30-second sprint interval is 0.5 minutes of intense effort.","Example 3 – Timing: A process taking 480 seconds requires 8 minutes."],"faqs":[{"question":"What is the conversion from Seconds to Minutes?","answer":"1 minute = 60 seconds.
