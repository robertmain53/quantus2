    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a power flow specified in BTU per hour (BTU/h) to Watts (W). The relationship is fixed: 1 BTU/h equals approximately 0.29307107 W when using the International Table BTU definition.",
      "Use this tool for HVAC sizing, appliance power comparison, and engineering checks. For highest assurance in regulated designs, verify which BTU definition your data source uses and cross-check final values against instrument calibration and applicable standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a direct unit equivalence derived from the energy content of one BTU and the definition of one Watt as one joule per second. We apply the International Table BTU energy value and convert per hour to per second.",
      "Results are presented as simple multiplications using a fixed conversion factor. Where regulatory or contractual work requires traceability, consult the referenced standards (NIST, ISO, IEEE) and document whether the International Table or thermochemical BTU was used."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with the value in BTU per hour (BTU/h).",
      "Step 2: Multiply by the factor 0.29307107 to get watts (W) when using the International Table BTU definition.",
      "Concise formula: Watts = BTU_per_hour × 0.29307107"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 BTU/h → 0.29307107 W",
      "5,000 BTU/h → 1,465.35535 W (5,000 × 0.29307107)",
      "12,000 BTU/h → 3,516.85284 W (12,000 × 0.29307107)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This is a fixed, one-input unit conversion from BTU/h to W using the International Table BTU. Use the thermochemical BTU factor if your source specifies that variant.",
      "For regulatory or safety-critical uses, confirm unit definitions and instrument calibration. Small differences in BTU definitions produce differences on the order of 0.1% and should be documented where precision matters."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exact conversion factor is used?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the International Table BTU, giving 1 BTU/h = 0.29307107 W. If your input uses the thermochemical BTU, the factor is slightly different; specify the BTU definition when precision is required."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are results?",
        "answer": "Results are as accurate as the chosen conversion factor and numeric precision. The International Table BTU factor yields accuracy well within typical HVAC and appliance tolerances. For instrumentation-grade accuracy, follow NIST and ISO guidance and account for rounding and measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to consider environmental conditions?",
        "answer": "The unit conversion itself does not depend on temperature or pressure. However, real-world power measurements of devices or heat flows can vary with operating conditions; include those effects separately in calculations or measurements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this converter be used for billing or compliance?",
        "answer": "It can be used for informational conversions. For billing, certification, or regulatory compliance, confirm the required unit definitions and tolerances with the governing body and reference standards."
