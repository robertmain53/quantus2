      "introduction": [
        "This converter transforms heating and cooling power ratings from BTU per hour to watts, enabling system comparison.",
        "HVAC systems use BTU/h while modern appliances specify power in watts.",
        "This converter uses the relationship where approximately 3.412 BTU/h equals 1 watt."
      ],
      "methodology": [
        "1 W ≈ 3.412 BTU/h. To convert BTU/h to watts, divide by 3.412.",
        "HVAC specifications traditionally use BTU/h; modern systems increasingly use watts for consistency.",
        "Understanding BTU/h to watts conversion is essential for selecting heating and cooling equipment.",
        "This converter provides accurate power conversion for HVAC planning."
      ],
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 – Space heater: 3,412 BTU/h = 1,000 watts.",
        "Example 2 – Small AC unit: 6,000 BTU/h ≈ 1,758 watts.",
        "Example 3 – Large HVAC system: 36,000 BTU/h ≈ 10,550 watts."

        {
          "question": "What is BTU/h used for?",
          "answer": "Heating and cooling system power rating, traditional in HVAC industry."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I size an AC unit?",
          "answer": "Rule of thumb: 20 BTU/h per square foot. 1,000 sq ft = 20,000 BTU/h."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between BTU and BTU/h?",
          "answer": "BTU is energy. BTU/h is power (energy rate). BTU/h measures heating/cooling rate."
        },
        {
          "question": "How efficient is modern HVAC?",
          "answer": "SEER rating (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) indicates AC efficiency. Higher SEER = more efficient."

        {
          "question": "What does AFUE mean for furnaces?",
          "answer": "Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency. 95% AFUE means 95% of fuel energy heats your home."

        {
          "question": "Can I install my AC myself?",
          "answer": "Professional installation recommended. Requires refrigerant handling and electrical expertise."
        },
        {
          "question": "What size generator do I need?",
          "answer": "Calculate wattage of all devices. Generator should be 20% larger. Convert AC BTU/h to watts for calculation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I service HVAC?",
          "answer": "Spring and fall maintenance recommended. Annual filter replacement minimum."
