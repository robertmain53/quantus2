    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms an area given in square meters (m²) into square kilometers (km²) using the International System of Units (SI) relationship between meter and kilometer.",
      "Conversions follow SI prefix rules: kilo means 1,000, and because area units are squared, 1 km² equals 1,000,000 m². Use this tool for engineering, land reporting, GIS prechecks, scientific calculations, and regulatory summaries where clear, SI-based conversions are required."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "We apply SI prefix algebra: the kilometer is defined as 1000 meters; squaring that ratio gives the area conversion factor. This approach aligns with NIST guidance on SI units and prefixes.",
      "The converter preserves numeric precision entered by users and returns exact conversion results; users should round results to an appropriate number of significant figures for reporting based on measurement uncertainty or regulatory requirements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "1 kilometer = 1,000 meters. Therefore 1 km² = (1,000 m)² = 1,000,000 m².",
      "To convert m² to km²: divide the value in m² by 1,000,000 (m² → km² = m² ÷ 1,000,000).",
      "To convert km² to m² (reverse): multiply km² by 1,000,000 (km² → m² = km² × 1,000,000)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5,000 m² → 0.005 km² (5,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.005)",
      "1,000,000 m² → 1 km² (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 1)",
      "12,345,678 m² → 12.345678 km² (12,345,678 ÷ 1,000,000 = 12.345678)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use this converter for direct, SI-consistent area unit changes between m² and km². The calculation is exact and based on the squared kilo (10^3) prefix: 10^6 factor for area.",
      "When preparing values for formal reports, append uncertainty, number of significant figures, or measurement method as required by the governing standard or regulator."

      "Square meter (m²): SI derived unit of area equal to the area of a square with sides of one meter.",
      "Square kilometer (km²): SI derived unit of area equal to the area of a square with sides of one kilometer (1 km = 1,000 m)."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between square meters and square kilometers?",
        "answer": "1 square kilometer equals 1,000,000 square meters. Convert by dividing square meters by 1,000,000 to get square kilometers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep after conversion?",
        "answer": "Keep as many significant figures as your input measurement and the downstream use require. For measured data, report results consistent with your instrument uncertainty; for regulatory reporting, follow the required rounding or significant-figure rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion appropriate for GIS and cadastral work?",
        "answer": "Yes — the numerical conversion is exact. For cadastral, survey, or GIS deliverables, also record coordinate system, datum, scale, and measurement uncertainty; converted numeric area alone does not replace those metadata."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do we square the prefix when converting area units?",
        "answer": "Area units are derived by squaring linear units. The kilo prefix is a factor of 10^3 for length; for area, the factor becomes (10^3)^2 = 10^6. This is standard SI practice as documented by national metrology authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small areas without losing accuracy?",
        "answer": "The arithmetic conversion is exact. Floating-point display may limit visible precision for extremely large or small numbers; choose appropriate formatting or scientific notation when necessary."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory or reporting standards I should be aware of when reporting area?",
        "answer": "Different sectors and agencies (environmental, land registry, planning) set their own formats and precision requirements. Always consult the relevant regulatory guidance or agency instructions before submitting official figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle measurement uncertainty for areas derived from survey instruments or remote sensing?",
        "answer": "Quantify uncertainty from instrument specifications and propagation of errors from linear measurements or raster cell sizes. Document methodology and include uncertainty or confidence intervals alongside converted values, following measurement best practices."
