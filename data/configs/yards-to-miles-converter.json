    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a length in yards to miles using the fixed mathematical relationship between the two imperial units. It is intended for everyday use, engineering estimates, and quick unit normalization where precise, traceable measurement is not required.",
      "For applications that require certified accuracy, calibration traceability, or compliance with lab accreditation, follow standard metrology and calibration practices described in international and national standards. See citations for authoritative references and accuracy notes below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The relationship between yards and miles is a fixed, exact conversion factor defined by measurement conventions: one mile equals 1760 yards. Conversions are purely arithmetic and do not depend on temperature, pressure, or other environmental factors.",
      "This tool performs a direct unit conversion without applying measurement uncertainty or instrument error corrections. When results are used for regulated work or instrumentation, apply appropriate calibration records and uncertainty budgets in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 and national metrology guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Conversion factor: 1 mile = 1760 yards.",
      "Primary calculation: miles = yards ÷ 1760.",
      "If converting from miles to yards: yards = miles × 1760.",
      "Round results according to required significant figures or decimal places for your application; do not assume implicit measurement certainty beyond the displayed digits."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "3520 yards → 3520 ÷ 1760 = 2 miles.",
      "880 yards → 880 ÷ 1760 = 0.5 miles.",
      "10000 yards → 10000 ÷ 1760 = 5.6818181818... miles. Round to required precision, for example 5.68182 miles (6 significant digits) or 5.68 miles (3 significant digits)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. The factor 1 mile = 1760 yards is an exact, conventionally defined relationship used for arithmetic unit conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I show?",
        "answer": "Decide based on the measurement context. For casual use two to three decimal places are often sufficient. For engineering or contractual work, follow the project specification or reporting standard and include uncertainty if required."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for measurement uncertainty or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This converter computes the mathematical conversion only. For traceable measurements, include instrument calibration, uncertainty analysis, and comply with ISO/IEC 17025 and applicable national metrology guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will very large numbers cause issues?",
        "answer": "This arithmetic conversion handles typical numeric ranges used in manuals and reports. For extremely large values use software or libraries that support high-precision arithmetic to avoid floating-point rounding errors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find standards on units and measurement practice?",
        "answer": "Refer to metrology and unit guidance from national metrology institutes and international standards organizations listed in the citations below for authoritative practices on units, reporting, and calibration."
