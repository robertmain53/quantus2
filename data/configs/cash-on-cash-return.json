    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates the pre-tax cash-on-cash return for a rental investment by comparing annual pre-tax cash flow to the total cash invested at acquisition. It uses user-supplied income, vacancy, expense and initial cost values to produce a clear percentage figure.",
      "Use the inputs to reflect conservative assumptions (realistic vacancy and expense reserves). Results are illustrative and meant for comparison and screening, not as final underwriting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Cash-on-cash return = (Annual pre-tax cash flow) / (Total cash invested) expressed as a percentage. Annual pre-tax cash flow is effective gross income minus operating expenses and annual debt service.",
      "This tool applies standard numeric best practices for stability and traceability. It follows guidance on secure data handling and testing from NIST and ISO for information security and authentication, and relies on IEEE floating-point handling recommendations for numeric operations. Users should validate with their own accounting and lender figures before relying on results."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Effective Gross Income = (Annual gross rent income + Other annual income) × (1 − Vacancy rate)",
      "Annual Cash Flow = Effective Gross Income − Annual operating expenses − Annual debt service",
      "Total Cash Invested = Down payment + Closing costs + Rehab / renovation costs + Other initial expenditures",
      "Cash-on-Cash Return (%) = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example: $24,000 gross rent, 5% vacancy, $8,000 operating expenses, $10,000 annual debt service, $50,000 down payment, $3,000 closing costs. Effective gross income = 24,000 × 0.95 = 22,800. Annual cash flow = 22,800 − 8,000 − 10,000 = 4,800. Total cash invested = 50,000 + 3,000 = 53,000. Cash-on-cash = (4,800 / 53,000) × 100 ≈ 9.06%.",
      "If total cash invested is zero in your inputs, the tool will not produce a meaningful percentage and results should be treated as invalid until initial investment inputs are provided."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator include tax effects or depreciation?",
        "answer": "No. This tool calculates pre-tax cash-on-cash return. It excludes income tax, depreciation, and other tax-related items. For after-tax returns include tax impacts in cash flow inputs externally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use pro forma or historical numbers?",
        "answer": "Use the figures that best match your decision point. For acquisition screening, use conservative pro forma estimates. For performance measurement, use actual historical income and expenses."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I have no mortgage?",
        "answer": "Set annual debt service to zero. The calculator will compute cash-on-cash using only operating cash flow divided by total cash invested."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the percentage?",
        "answer": "The numerical result is precise to standard floating-point arithmetic, but accuracy depends on input quality. Treat outputs as estimates and cross-check with detailed underwriting models. See the citations for standards on numeric and security practices."
