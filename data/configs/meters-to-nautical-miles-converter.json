    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a numerical length in meters to nautical miles using the internationally recognised definition of the nautical mile. Use it for quick unit conversions in navigation planning, engineering checks, scientific calculations, and documentation.",
      "The tool returns a numeric result only. Before relying on any value for safety-critical, regulatory, or legal purposes, verify instrument calibration, uncertainty, and the appropriate regulatory references listed below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the fixed international definition: one nautical mile is exactly 1852 metres. The calculator applies that exact relationship and returns a numeric quotient.",
      "For documentation and traceability, this page references national and international measurement standards. Users performing precision work should follow guidance from standards bodies on significant figures, instrument calibration, and uncertainty reporting. Numerical rounding and machine representation follow common floating-point practice; consult IEEE 754 guidance for binary floating-point limitations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Definition: 1 nautical mile (nmi) = 1852 metres (m).",
      "Formula: nautical_miles = meters / 1852",
      "Practical steps: 1) Enter the value in metres. 2) Divide by 1852. 3) Round according to required significant figures or regulatory rules. For published navigation distances, follow charting authority conventions."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Convert 5000 m: 5000 / 1852 = 2.699459... → 2.699 nmi (rounded to 3 decimal places).",
      "Convert 1 m: 1 / 1852 = 0.0005399568... → 0.00054 nmi (rounded to 5 significant figures)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly is a nautical mile?",
        "answer": "A nautical mile is a unit of length used in marine and air navigation that is internationally defined as exactly 1852 metres. It was chosen to approximate one minute of arc along a meridian and is used for charting and distance reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What conversion factor does this tool use?",
        "answer": "This tool uses the internationally accepted exact factor of 1 nmi = 1852 m. The conversion is a fixed mathematical division by 1852."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places or significant figures should I use?",
        "answer": "Required precision depends on context. For casual planning, three decimal places is common. For navigation or instrument calibration, follow the significant-figure rules in measurement standards and your operating authority. When in doubt, report the uncertainty alongside the converted value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for chart plotting or legal navigation documents?",
        "answer": "This converter provides the arithmetic unit conversion only. For chart plotting, route planning, or legal documents, use official nautical charts, notices to mariners, and the procedures of your flag or regulatory authority. Verify values against certified tools and instrument calibration records."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this conversion account for geodesic distances or earth curvature?",
        "answer": "No. This is a simple unit conversion of a linear length. For distances measured on the earth's surface or routes between coordinates, use geodesic formulas (great-circle, rhumb line) or a dedicated geodetic calculator that accounts for the chosen ellipsoid."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I handle floating-point rounding and machine precision?",
        "answer": "Computers represent real numbers with finite precision. For critical work, use libraries and numeric formats that follow IEEE 754 recommendations and include uncertainty propagation. Round only as the final step and document rounding rules and uncertainty."
