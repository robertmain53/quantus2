    "introduction": [
      "This ROI calculator computes simple return on investment (ROI), net profit, total return, and an annualized (CAGR) return based on the initial amount invested, the final proceeds or value, and any additional costs such as fees or taxes.",
      "Use the simple ROI for a quick profitability check: ROI = (Net Profit / Initial Investment) × 100. Use the annualized return to compare investments with different holding periods by converting total growth into a compound annual rate."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Simple ROI is computed as: ((final_value - initial_investment - total_costs) / initial_investment) × 100. Net profit equals final_value minus initial_investment and additional costs.",
      "Annualized return uses the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) formula: (final_value / initial_investment)^(1 / years) − 1, expressed as a percentage. This expresses total growth as an equivalent constant yearly growth rate.",
      "All fields are numeric. Enter additional costs to reflect fees, transaction costs, maintenance, or taxes to get a realistic ROI. For multi-year, uneven cash flows, use an IRR or discounted cash flow tool; this calculator provides a standardized summary metric for comparability."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between simple ROI and annualized return?",
        "answer": "Simple ROI measures total return over the entire holding period without adjusting for time. Annualized return (CAGR) converts total return into an equivalent per-year compound growth rate, allowing direct comparison between investments of different durations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I include fees, taxes, and other costs?",
        "answer": "Include all non-investment cash outflows that reduce proceeds in the 'Additional costs' field (commissions, taxes on sale, maintenance). These are subtracted from final value before computing net profit and ROI."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my holding period is less than one year or zero?",
        "answer": "For annualized calculations, this tool requires a positive holding period (minimum 0.01 years). For very short periods, annualized figures can appear large — interpret them as an extrapolated rate, not a guaranteed annual return."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for projects with multiple uneven cash flows?",
        "answer": "This calculator assumes a single initial outflow and a single final inflow. For multiple or irregular cash flows, IRR or discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is more accurate; consider an IRR/NPV tool for multi-period cash flows."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the results and should I rely on them for financial decisions?",
        "answer": "Results are mathematically correct for the inputs provided, but inputs must reflect reality (all costs, correct closing value). This tool does not account for taxes, inflation, risk, or opportunity cost; consult a financial professional for decisions with significant financial consequences."
