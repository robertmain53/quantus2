1. This is a simple_calc because EBIT is computed from several related user inputs (revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, depreciation & amortization, and optional other operating income/expenses). The calculation uses a single clear formulaic output (EBIT) and benefits from a multi-field form with optional secondary metrics (EBIT margin, adjusted EBIT).

2. I will use component_type: "simple_calc" with logic.type: "formula".

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (I will also include examples[] and glossary[] as flat arrays where helpful).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings, no Markdown like [url](url), and no HTML.

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no canonical_url, robots, keywords, schema_org, open_graph, twitter_card, or other non-allowed keys). The form object will follow the allowed schema for simple_calc.

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

I scanned the provided competitor assets and will draw authoritative formula, calibration guidance, and UX patterns from them; I will cite relevant university and U.S. government resources (plain HTTPS) in the citations section and include trust signals and FAQs addressing limits, rounding, and auditability. 

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
