    "introduction": [
      "In photometry, lux (lx) measures illuminance: the luminous flux per unit area reaching a surface. Lumens (lm) measure the total visible light emitted by a source.",
      "By the SI definition, 1 lux equals 1 lumen per square metre (1 lx = 1 lm/m²). To find the total lumens reaching a surface, multiply the measured illuminance in lux by the illuminated area in square metres.",
      "This calculator helps you convert illuminance measurements into total luminous flux for lighting design, laboratory work, food photography, and workplace compliance."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the SI definition of lux: 1 lx = 1 lm/m².",
      "Rearranging for lumens: Luminous Flux (lumens) = Illuminance (lux) × Area (m²).",
      "This relationship is consistent with lighting-engineering teaching at major universities and with the lumen method used in electrical and building-services design."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Office workstation: A 12 m² office zone designed for 500 lx requires approximately 500 × 12 = 6000 lumens from fixtures.",
      "Food photography: Measuring 1500 lx on a 2 m² table means about 1500 × 2 = 3000 lumens of light reaching the surface.",
      "Lab bench: A 4 m² bench requiring 750 lx illuminance needs approximately 750 × 4 = 3000 lumens to comply with safety guidelines."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between lux and lumens?",
        "answer": "By definition, 1 lux equals 1 lumen per square metre (1 lx = 1 lm/m²). To find lumens, multiply illuminance in lux by the illuminated area in m². For example, 400 lx on 5 m² corresponds to 2000 lm."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do safety standards talk about lux instead of lumens?",
        "answer": "Illuminance in lux describes the light reaching the working plane where people read, work, or inspect. That is what safety standards care about. Lumens measure light emitted by a source; the same lumens can produce very different lux levels depending on area, distance, optics, and reflectances."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this calculation?",
        "answer": "The formula is mathematically exact. In practice, accuracy depends on your lux meter calibration, how uniformly the area is lit, and how precisely you know the illuminated area. For design work, engineers apply utilization and maintenance factors, then confirm with on-site measurements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for photography and video lighting?",
        "answer": "Yes. Many photographers and videographers use lux readings on set to estimate light output from panels and softboxes, and to compare fixtures from different manufacturers. Always test with your camera after using the calculator, since exposure also depends on shutter speed, aperture, and ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this account for beam angle or distance from the light source?",
        "answer": "No. Beam angle, distance, and optical losses are all reflected in the lux value you measure with your meter. This calculator converts that illuminance and area into lumens. To predict lux before installation, use professional lighting-design software or manufacturer photometry data."
