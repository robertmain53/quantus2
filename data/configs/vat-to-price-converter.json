      "Convert a VAT amount back to net and gross price instantly so invoices, receipts, and audit notes stay consistent.",
      "Editable VAT rate covers standard and reduced bands across the EU and UK, while keeping the experience lean for quick checks.",
      "Both net and gross figures are shown together so finance, procurement, and compliance teams align without extra steps."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Net price = VAT ÷ (VAT rate/100); gross price = net + VAT. This aligns with EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC and HMRC guidance for reverse calculations.",
      "We keep the inputs unit-agnostic (currency) and apply no rounding beyond display formatting; round per your jurisdiction’s invoicing rules.",
      "Document the VAT rate and jurisdiction (e.g., HMRC VAT Notice 700 or EU standard/reduced rates) when using outputs for filings or audits."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "VAT £20 at 20% → net £100, gross £120.",
      "VAT €5.5 at 10% → net €55, gross €60.5.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which VAT rate should I enter?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How should I round the results?",
        "answer": "Round according to your jurisdiction’s invoicing rules (e.g., to the nearest cent/penny). The calculator keeps full precision until display."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I handle exempt items?",
        "answer": "Exempt or zero-rated items have no VAT; set the rate to 0% to see net = gross = VAT amount of 0."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this acceptable for audits?",
        "answer": "Yes, provided you record the rate, jurisdiction, and rounding applied. Cite HMRC VAT Notice 700 or your local EU guidance when filing."
