    "introduction": [
      "This tool converts a speed value given in meters per second (m/s) to knots (nautical miles per hour) using the internationally agreed unit definitions. It is intended for navigation, meteorology, and engineering use where a direct, repeatable conversion is required.",
      "The conversion uses the fixed relationship defined by the international nautical mile (1 nautical mile = 1852 meters). The result is a simple scaling of the input value; no environmental corrections are applied by the converter.",
      "When using converted values for safety-critical tasks, instrument calibration and traceability to national metrology standards are important. See the methodology and citations for guidance on uncertainty and standards references."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Conversion is a fixed linear scale based on the international definition: 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour = 1852 meters / 3600 seconds = 0.514444444... meters per second. The converter multiplies the input (m/s) by the reciprocal of 0.514444444... to produce knots.",
      "The numeric factor is derived from internationally maintained definitions. For reporting and regulatory compliance, maintain traceability to national metrology institutes and follow guidance on measurement uncertainty from standards bodies.",
      "Floating-point rounding and display precision do not change the true mathematical result; they only affect presented precision. For safety- or compliance-critical uses, round and report results consistent with the relevant standard (for example, number of significant figures required by the application) and keep instrument calibration records."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Start with speed in meters per second (m/s).",
      "Step 2: Use the exact relationship 1 knot = 1852 meters / 3600 seconds = 0.514444444444... m/s.",
      "Step 3: Convert by dividing meters per second by 0.514444444444... or multiply by 1.9438444924406. Formula: knots = meters_per_second × 1.9438444924406.",
      "Note: The converter may display a rounded result; full precision is retained internally per IEEE 754 arithmetic but display precision can be chosen by the user or application."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor from meters per second to knots?",
        "answer": "Exact relationship: 1 knot = 0.514444444444... meters per second. Therefore knots = meters_per_second ÷ 0.514444444444... or multiplied by approximately 1.9438444924406."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is a nautical mile 1852 meters?",
        "answer": "The international nautical mile was standardized to 1852 meters by international agreement to provide a consistent unit for navigation and charting. See standards bodies for the historical and legal basis."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use for navigation or weather reporting?",
        "answer": "Required precision depends on the application. For general navigation, one decimal place in knots is common. For scientific or instrument-grade data, report according to instrument uncertainty and applicable standards. Follow guidance from national metrology and domain-specific regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This converter applies a deterministic mathematical scale only. Measurement uncertainty and calibration traceability must be handled separately and documented according to relevant standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert knots back to meters per second?",
        "answer": "Yes. The inverse relationship is meters_per_second = knots × 0.514444444444... A sibling converter or the reverse operation can perform that calculation."
