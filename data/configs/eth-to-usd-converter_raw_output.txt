1. This is a converter because the user wants to convert a single numeric amount of one currency (ETH) to a single numeric amount of another currency (USD) with a one-to-one conversion interaction (one input → one output).

2. I will use component_type: "converter" with logic.type: "conversion" to match that interaction model.

3. I will structure page_content as flat arrays only: introduction[], methodology[], faqs[], citations[] (and optional examples/summary/glossary as flat arrays).

4. All URLs in citations will be plain HTTPS strings (no Markdown, no HTML).

5. I will NOT add any forbidden fields (no form for this converter, no canonical_url, no robots, no schema_org beyond the allowed schema.additionalTypes, no other custom fields).

6. I understand this is the final JSON and I cannot add commentary or explanations afterward.

Ready for me to produce the JSON?
