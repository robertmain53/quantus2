    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates a volume value in liters (L) to cubic feet (ft³) using the fixed mathematical relationship between the two units. Use it for quick engineering checks, lab notes, inventory sizing, or when preparing documentation that mixes metric and imperial volumes.",
      "The output is intended as a numerical conversion only. For regulated measurements, calibration traceability, or legal reporting follow the applicable standards and record measurement uncertainty as described below."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies a constant conversion factor that maps one liter to the exact defined equivalent in cubic feet. The conversion factor is based on the base SI definition of the liter and the internationally accepted length-to-volume relationships.",
      "Accuracy guidance: for general-purpose conversions use 6–9 significant digits. For regulatory, safety, or contractual work, consult NIST and ISO documents and include instrument uncertainty and calibration records as required by the relevant authority."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Core relationship: 1 cubic foot = 28.316846592 liters.",
      "Therefore: value_in_ft3 = value_in_liters ÷ 28.316846592. Equivalently: value_in_ft3 = value_in_liters × 0.035314666721489.",
      "Steps: (1) take the input in liters; (2) multiply by 0.035314666721489; (3) round to the required number of significant figures or decimal places for your context."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 1 L → 1 × 0.035314666721489 = 0.0353146667 ft³ (useful for high-precision lab notes).",
      "Example 2: 1000 L → 1000 × 0.035314666721489 = 35.3146667215 ft³ (round to 35.3147 ft³ for four decimal places).",
      "Example 3: 250 L → 250 × 0.035314666721489 = 8.8286666804 ft³ (round to 8.829 ft³ for three decimals)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use the provided factor (1 L = 0.035314666721489 ft³) for direct, repeatable conversions.",
      "For compliance or safety-critical reporting include instrument uncertainty and reference the applicable standards (NIST, ISO, IEEE, OSHA) as required by the regulating body."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many liters are in one cubic foot?",
        "answer": "One cubic foot equals 28.316846592 liters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I keep?",
        "answer": "For everyday use 3–4 significant digits are sufficient. For engineering or scientific work use 6–9 significant digits and always state measurement uncertainty when required by standards or contracts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this conversion exact?",
        "answer": "The conversion uses the defined constants for SI and imperial units, but practical measurements have uncertainty. The mathematical factor is fixed; the measured volume may vary due to instrument error, temperature, pressure, or sampling method."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I consider calibration and traceability?",
        "answer": "When conversions support legal reporting, safety calculations, batch mixing, or contractual obligations, ensure measuring devices are calibrated, traceable to national standards, and that uncertainty is documented in line with NIST and ISO guidance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to adjust for temperature or pressure?",
        "answer": "Liquids are typically affected by temperature; volumes of gases are affected by both temperature and pressure. If your application is temperature- or pressure-sensitive, apply the appropriate thermophysical corrections before or after unit conversion."
