    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a speed value given in kilometres per hour (km/h) to knots (kn). A knot is defined as one nautical mile per hour; one nautical mile is exactly 1 852 metres, making the conversion factor exact by definition.",
      "The tool returns a numeric conversion suitable for general-purpose, navigation, and engineering use. Read the methodology and accuracy notes below for guidance on appropriate rounding, calibration, and regulatory considerations for safety- or compliance-critical applications."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the internationally accepted exact ratio between the kilometre and the nautical mile: 1 knot = 1.852 km/h. This relationship follows from the definition of the nautical mile (exactly 1 852 m) and the metre as an SI base unit.",
      "For display and reporting, choose rounding and significant-digit rules that match your domain: use 2–3 significant digits for high-level reports, 3–5 digits for engineering use, and follow the precision requirements specified by relevant authorities for navigation and safety.",
      "Follow measurement and calibration best practices referenced by national metrology and standards organizations. For traceable instrumentation and workplace measurement requirements consult standards and guidelines issued by national metrology institutes, ISO, IEEE, and applicable occupational safety agencies."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Exact definition: 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour and 1 nautical mile = 1 852 metres.",
      "Primary formula: knots = km_per_hour ÷ 1.852",
      "Alternate form: km_per_hour = knots × 1.852",
      "Procedure: take the numeric speed in km/h, divide by 1.852, and round according to the required precision for your context."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: Convert 100 km/h to knots: 100 ÷ 1.852 = 53.995... → typically reported as 54.0 kn (rounded to one decimal).",
      "Example 2: Convert 10 km/h to knots: 10 ÷ 1.852 = 5.3995... → commonly reported as 5.400 kn (three decimals) for precision."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is a knot and why is it used?",
        "answer": "A knot is a unit of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour. It is used in maritime and aviation contexts because the nautical mile corresponds closely to one minute of latitude, simplifying navigation and charting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why divide by 1.852 to convert km/h to knots?",
        "answer": "Because one knot equals 1.852 kilometres per hour. Dividing km/h by 1.852 converts the speed into nautical miles per hour (knots). The factor 1.852 is exact, derived from the exact definition of the nautical mile as 1 852 metres."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Use the precision appropriate to your use case: 1 decimal for general display, 2–3 decimals for operational use, and more for engineering calculations. For regulated operations (aviation, commercial shipping) follow the precision and reporting rules set by the relevant authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there accuracy limits or calibration concerns?",
        "answer": "This conversion is exact mathematically. Accuracy concerns arise from the measurement instrument (speed sensors, GPS). Ensure instruments are calibrated and traceable to national standards. For compliance work, document calibration certificates and uncertainty budgets per ISO and national metrology guidelines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which standards should I consult for traceable measurements?",
        "answer": "Consult documentation from your national metrology institute and relevant international standards such as the ISO 80000 series for quantities and units, IEEE standards for instruments where applicable, and guidance from occupational safety agencies when measurements affect worker safety."
