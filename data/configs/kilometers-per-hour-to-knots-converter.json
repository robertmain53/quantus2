    "introduction": [
      "This converter transforms a single speed value in kilometres per hour (km/h) to nautical knots (kn). Knots are used widely in maritime and aviation contexts and are defined using the international nautical mile.",
      "The conversion is based on the exact international definition that one nautical mile = 1 852 metres. That gives a fixed conversion factor: 1 knot = 1.852 km/h, so the arithmetic conversion itself is exact. Practical accuracy depends on the precision of the input value and the accuracy/calibration of the measuring instrument."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The tool applies the international definition: one nautical mile equals exactly 1 852 metres. From that, 1 knot (one nautical mile per hour) equals 1.852 kilometres per hour exactly.",
      "Because the relationship is exact, the converter performs a pure unit transformation with no empirical assumptions. Measurement uncertainty enters only through the input (the measured speed) or any rounding applied to the output.",
      "For guidance on measurement traceability and instrument calibration consult national metrology guidance and accreditation standards such as NIST references for units, ISO standards for quantities and calibration processes, and ISO/IEC 17025 for laboratory competence. For sensor and instrumentation recommendations consult relevant IEEE standards. For workplace safety limits tied to wind or speed consult applicable OSHA guidance."

    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Primary formula: knots = kilometres_per_hour ÷ 1.852",
      "Inverse formula: kilometres_per_hour = knots × 1.852",
      "Equivalent intermediate: 1 knot = 1 nautical mile/hour = 1852 metres / 3600 seconds = 0.514444... metres/second"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 100 km/h → 100 ÷ 1.852 = 53.995... → typically shown as 54.0 kn when rounded to one decimal place.",
      "Example 2: 10 km/h → 10 ÷ 1.852 = 5.3995... → shown as 5.40 kn when rounded to two decimal places."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact or approximate?",
        "answer": "The conversion factor 1 knot = 1.852 km/h is exact because the nautical mile is defined as exactly 1852 metres. Any approximation arises from rounding the numeric result, not from the conversion itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose precision based on context. For navigation and operational planning one decimal place is common (e.g., 54.0 kn). For scientific work preserve enough digits to exceed instrument uncertainty; do not present more digits than the measured value's significant figures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does instrument calibration affect the result?",
        "answer": "This converter only transforms a numeric input. The real-world accuracy depends on how the speed was measured. Follow calibration and traceability practices per ISO/IEC 17025 and national metrology guidance to quantify measurement uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative speeds or zero?",
        "answer": "Yes. The mathematical conversion supports zero and negative values. Negative speeds indicate direction opposite to the positive reference direction; ensure that is meaningful in your application."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there safety or regulatory considerations tied to speed conversions?",
        "answer": "Converted values may be used in operational limits and safety procedures. Verify any regulatory thresholds in the units required by the regulating body and consult OSHA or industry-specific standards when speed ties to workplace safety or equipment limits."
