    "introduction": [
      "This lumen to lux converter is built on real photometric geometry rather than a simple unit table. Lux cannot be derived from lumens alone: you must also specify distance and how the light is distributed in space.",
      "Unlike pure unit converters that silently assume 1 m² of area, this tool lets you choose between three physically valid models – directional beam, isotropic source and fixed illuminated area – and exposes the equations used, so both students and professionals can trust and audit the result."
    ],

    "methodology": [
      "Lux is defined as one lumen per square metre on a surface. Formally, E = Φ / A, where E is illuminance in lux, Φ is luminous flux in lumens, and A is the illuminated area in square metres.",
      "For real luminaires with a beam angle, the illuminated area depends on geometry. This converter therefore uses the solid angle Ω of the beam, defined as Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)) for a rotationally symmetric cone of full angle θ.",
      "The directional mode applies the photometric relation E = Φ / (Ω·d²). The isotropic mode uses the special case Ω = 4π for a full sphere, giving E = Φ / (4π·d²). The fixed-area mode applies E = Φ / A when the effective area is directly known or constrained.",
      "All calculations follow the inverse-square law for point-like sources: illuminance decreases with the square of the distance. Doubling distance reduces illuminance to one quarter, which is critical in lighting design and often overlooked in simplistic calculators.",
      "Rounding is handled deterministically under IEEE-754 floating-point rules. This is particularly important for audit-ready use, where reproducibility of results across platforms and sessions matters."
    ],

    "educational_sections": [
      {
        "heading": "Why lumens and lux are not interchangeable",
        "body": "Lumens describe how much visible light a source emits in total. Lux describes how brightly a surface is illuminated once that light has spread over some area. The same 1000 lm can yield only about 80 lux in a very wide distribution, but more than 160,000 lux in a narrow 5° spot. The difference – a factor of more than 2000 – comes entirely from geometry, not from the lamp itself."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Three physical models you can toggle between",
        "body": "Use the directional mode for LED spotlights and luminaires with a specified beam angle; use the isotropic mode for idealised point sources radiating equally in all directions; and use the fixed-area mode when you know the illuminated area, for example a workbench or inspection surface. Switching modes shows how the same lumens translate into very different lux values."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Inverse-square law and distance sensitivity",
        "body": "Because illuminance scales as 1/d², small changes in mounting height or camera distance can have large effects on lux. Going from 1 m to 2 m does not halve the light but cuts it to a quarter; going from 1 m to 5 m reduces illuminance by a factor of 25. This converter makes that behaviour explicit."
      }
    ],

    "examples": [
      "Directional mode, 1000 lm, 60° beam, 1 m distance → approximately 1,190 lux.",
      "Same lamp and beam at 2 m distance → approximately 298 lux (one quarter of the 1 m value).",
      "Same lamp at 1 m but with a 30° beam → approximately 4,700 lux, showing how narrowing the beam concentrates light.",
      "Isotropic mode, 1000 lm at 1 m → approximately 79.6 lux, matching the 4π solid angle of a sphere.",
      "Fixed-area mode, 1000 lm over 2 m² → 500 lux."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does this tool ask for distance and beam angle while some other converters do not?",
        "answer": "Because there is no single fixed ratio between lumens and lux. Any physically correct conversion must take geometry into account. Tools that treat lumens and lux as simple units of the same quantity silently assume an area of 1 m², which is rarely true in real installations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which mode should I use for a typical LED downlight or spotlight?",
        "answer": "Use the directional mode and enter the beam angle from the datasheet (commonly 15°, 30°, 60° or 90°) together with the mounting height. This gives a realistic estimate of lux on the task plane."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does a small beam angle produce so many lux?",
        "answer": "Because the same luminous flux is concentrated over a much smaller area. A 5° beam concentrates light over ~2000× more than a 120° floodlight, producing proportionally higher lux. Beam geometry dominates the result."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'solid angle' mean?",
        "answer": "Solid angle (Ω, measured in steradians [sr]) describes how 'wide' a cone of light is. A 60° cone has Ω ≈ 0.84 sr. A 180° hemisphere has Ω = 6.28 sr. A full sphere (all directions) has Ω = 4π ≈ 12.57 sr. The formula Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)) converts half-angle θ to solid angle."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does doubling the distance reduce lux to one quarter?",
        "answer": "The inverse-square law: illuminance ∝ 1/d². When you double d, you get 1/(2d)² = 1/(4d²). Light spreads equally in all directions from a point source, so doubling distance spreads the same light over 4× the area, reducing illuminance to 1/4."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I quote these lux values in a professional report?",
        "answer": "Yes, provided you document your assumptions (flux, distance, beam angle or area). This tool exposes the equations and uses deterministic rounding so that your numbers are reproducible. For legal or regulatory purposes you should also perform on-site measurements with a calibrated lux meter as required by standards."
