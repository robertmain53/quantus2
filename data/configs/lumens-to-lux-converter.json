    "introduction": [
      "Lux cannot be derived from lumens alone—lux requires geometry: distance and illuminated area. This calculator bridges educational tools and professional audit-ready methods, using true photometric equations from ISO/CIE standards.",
      "The same 1000 lm produce ~80 lux in a wide floodlight and over 160,000 lux in a narrow 5° spotlight. This 2000× difference is caused entirely by geometry, not by lamp brightness."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Why lumens ≠ lux: Lux measures luminous flux per unit area (1 lx = 1 lm/m²). Real luminaires do not illuminate a flat 1 m² area; the illuminated area depends on distance and beam cone.",
      "Directional beams are described by the solid angle Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)). Illuminance is then E = Φ / (Ω d²). For isotropic (omni-directional) sources, Ω = 4π, giving E = Φ / (4π d²).",
      "The inverse-square law applies universally: doubling distance reduces lux to one quarter. This law is essential for understanding light falloff at distance.",
      "These formulas match the methodology in professional lighting design, LED photometry, ISO/CIE standards (CIE S 025, LM-79), and metrological reports. Deterministic IEEE 754 rounding avoids floating-point drift."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1000 lm spotlight (directional), 60° beam, 1 m distance → ~1190 lux",
      "Same lamp at 2 m → ~298 lux (inverse square law: 1/4 reduction)",
      "Same lamp but 30° beam → ~4700 lux (narrow beam concentrates light)",
      "Same 1000 lm as isotropic point source, 1 m distance → ~80 lux",
      "1000 lm illuminating 2 m² (fixed area) → 500 lux"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does this calculator show different results from OmniCalculator?",
        "answer": "OmniCalculator uses a simplified educational model. Quantus v3.0 uses the full solid-angle formulation (Ω = 2π(1 − cos θ/2)) aligned with ISO/CIE standards, providing audit-grade accuracy and three distinct physical models (directional, isotropic, fixed-area)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does a small beam angle produce so many lux?",
        "answer": "Because the same luminous flux is concentrated over a much smaller area. A 5° beam concentrates light over ~2000× more than a 120° floodlight, producing proportionally higher lux. Beam geometry dominates the result."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'solid angle' mean?",
        "answer": "Solid angle (Ω, measured in steradians [sr]) describes how 'wide' a cone of light is. A 60° cone has Ω ≈ 0.84 sr. A 180° hemisphere has Ω = 6.28 sr. A full sphere (all directions) has Ω = 4π ≈ 12.57 sr. The formula Ω = 2π(1 − cos(θ/2)) converts half-angle θ to solid angle."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this value in a professional report or audit?",
        "answer": "Yes. Quantus v3.0 provides traceable methodology (ISO/CIE-aligned), deterministic rounding, and clear input documentation. However, for compliance you must still validate measurements with a calibrated lux meter as required by applicable standards (ISO 8995-1, OSHA 1926.56, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I interpret the three illuminance outputs?",
        "answer": "Use the directional model if your light source has a beam angle (spotlights, LEDs, directed fixtures). Use the isotropic model for omnidirectional sources (bare incandescent bulbs, undirected light). Use the fixed-area model if you know exactly what area is illuminated. Most cases use the directional model."
      },
      {
        "question": "What uncertainties should I account for?",
        "answer": "Real-world uncertainties include: (1) Beam angle variation by ±10% or more, (2) Distance measurement ±0.1 m, (3) Lumen rating tolerance ±15–20% from manufacturer, (4) Reflectance/absorption in the space. Professional measurements require a calibrated lux meter and standardized geometry."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does doubling the distance reduce lux to one quarter?",
        "answer": "The inverse-square law: illuminance ∝ 1/d². When you double d, you get 1/(2d)² = 1/(4d²). Light spreads equally in all directions from a point source, so doubling distance spreads the same light over 4× the area, reducing illuminance to 1/4."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which photometric standard does this follow?",
        "answer": "Quantus uses the ISO/CIE framework: CIE S 025/LM-79 for light source measurements, ISO 8995-1 for workplace lighting, and NIST/metrological definitions of candela, lumen, and lux. The solid-angle and inverse-square-law formulations are standard in photometric engineering worldwide."
