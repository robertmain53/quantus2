    "introduction": [
      "Use this converter to transform frequency given in kilohertz (kHz) into angular frequency expressed in radians per second (rad/s). The conversion is rooted in standard SI definitions and the angular frequency relationship ω = 2π·f.",
      "This tool treats 1 kHz = 1000 Hz exactly and uses the exact mathematical relationship between frequency and angular frequency to deliver high-precision results suitable for engineering, lab work, and documentation.",
      "Guidance is included for choosing significant figures, understanding instrument limits, and ensuring measurement traceability to national standards."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Step 1 — Convert kilohertz to hertz: multiply the kHz value by 1000 because 1 kHz = 1000 Hz (exact in SI).",
      "Step 2 — Compute angular frequency: multiply the frequency in hertz by 2π to obtain ω in rad/s. This follows ω = 2π · f where f is in Hz and π is the mathematical constant.",
      "Precision and reporting: show results with meaningful significant figures based on the input precision and instrument uncertainty. For laboratory or regulatory reporting, state the value and the measurement uncertainty separately and reference traceable calibration certificates."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula summary: ω (rad/s) = 2π × f (Hz).",
      "Expanded for kilohertz: ω (rad/s) = 2π × (kHz × 1000) = 2000π × kHz.",
      "Example exact expression for 1 kHz: ω = 2000π rad/s ≈ 6283.185307179586 rad/s."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact mathematical relationship between kHz and rad/s?",
        "answer": "Angular frequency ω (in rad/s) is ω = 2π × f, where f is frequency in Hz. Since 1 kHz = 1000 Hz, multiply kHz by 1000 then by 2π (ω = 2π × 1000 × kHz)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the radian a base SI unit and how should I report it?",
        "answer": "The radian is a derived dimensionless unit used to measure angles in SI. When reporting angular frequency, include the unit 'rad/s' to be explicit that the quantity is angular frequency and not cycles per second."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant digits should I keep?",
        "answer": "Match the result precision to the least precise input or to your instrument's measurement uncertainty. For general use, 4–6 significant digits are common; for lab reports use the significant figures supported by your calibrated equipment and include uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there practical limits or pitfalls when converting very large or small frequencies?",
        "answer": "Numerical overflow/underflow can occur for extreme magnitudes in some software environments. In measurement practice, instrument bandwidth, sampling rate, and aliasing limit the usable frequency range. Always verify instrument specifications and use traceable calibration."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does instrument calibration affect reported values?",
        "answer": "Calibration against national standards (traceable to agencies such as NIST or through accredited labs) ensures accuracy. Include calibration dates and uncertainty when using converted values for regulatory or contractual purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use rad/s instead of Hz (or kHz)?",
        "answer": "Use rad/s for equations and analyses involving angular motion, rotational dynamics, control systems, and phasor/angular-frequency domains. Use Hz (or kHz) when reporting cycles per second or frequency in common engineering communication contexts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert back from rad/s to kHz?",
        "answer": "Inverse conversion: f (Hz) = ω / (2π), then kHz = f (Hz) / 1000."
