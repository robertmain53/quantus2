            "This tire size calculator helps you decode common passenger tire codes such as 225/55R17 and translate them into engineering quantities: sidewall height, overall diameter, circumference and revolutions per mile or kilometer.",
            "You can analyze a single tire size or compare two sizes side by side to see how much overall diameter changes and how that affects speedometer readings at a given indicated speed.",
            "The formulas used here follow the same conventions described in international tyre and rim standards for metric series passenger car tires and in technical guidance from major tire and vehicle engineering sources."
        ],
        "methodology": [
            "For standard metric passenger tire sizes, the sidewall height is modeled as the product of section width and aspect ratio: sidewall_height_mm = width_mm × aspect_ratio_percent ÷ 100, where the nominal section width is given in millimeters and the aspect ratio is the percentage of sidewall height relative to width, consistent with ISO 4000-1 series standards for metric passenger car tyre designation.",
            "The overall unloaded diameter is approximated by adding twice the sidewall height to the rim diameter converted to millimeters: overall_diameter_mm = rim_diameter_in × 25.4 + 2 × sidewall_height_mm. This is the same relationship used in many engineering references and tire industry calculators for estimating tire outside diameter from sidewall markings.",
            "Circumference is estimated from the ideal geometric circle relationship using π ≈ 3.14159, so circumference_mm = overall_diameter_mm × π. Revolutions per kilometer are then 1,000,000 ÷ circumference_mm, because one kilometer equals 1,000,000 millimeters. Revolutions per mile are similarly derived using the mile in inches and the corresponding circumference in inches.",
            "When comparing two tire sizes, the percentage change in diameter is modeled as (new_diameter ÷ original_diameter − 1) × 100. Under a rigid-wheel approximation, vehicle speed at a given engine and gear speed scales directly with rolling circumference, so a larger overall diameter yields a higher true road speed for the same indicated speed on an uncorrected speedometer.",
            "The speedometer error calculation assumes the instrument was originally calibrated for the first tire size and that only tire diameter has changed. Actual vehicle behavior also depends on factors such as dynamic rolling radius under load, inflation pressure, tread wear, and manufacturing tolerances, which are analyzed in vehicle dynamics and tire engineering textbooks from universities and technical institutes.",
            "This tool is intended for preliminary engineering and fitment checks. Before selecting or fitting tires, users should always consult the vehicle manufacturer and tire manufacturer data, including load index, speed symbol, and approved alternative sizes as specified in standards-based references and regulatory guidance."
        ],
        "faqs": [
            {
                "question": "Which tire sizes does this calculator support?",
                "answer": "This calculator is designed for common metric passenger car tire sizes written in the form width/aspect ratio R rim diameter, such as 225/55R17. It assumes the width is in millimeters, the aspect ratio is a percentage, and the rim diameter is in inches, consistent with the metric series conventions described in ISO 4000-1 for passenger car tyres."
            },
            {
                "question": "How accurate are the diameter and revolutions per mile results?",
                "answer": "The outputs are based on standard geometric formulas applied to the nominal section width, aspect ratio, and rim diameter printed on the sidewall. In practice, real tires can differ from these ideal values because of manufacturing tolerances, load, pressure, and tread wear. Engineering studies of tire dynamics show that the dynamic rolling radius under load is slightly smaller than the unloaded radius, so real-world revolutions per mile may differ from the ideal values. For critical applications, use manufacturer data or direct measurement to validate results."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is this calculator enough to decide whether a tire size is safe and legal on my vehicle?",
                "answer": "No. This calculator focuses on geometric effects such as diameter, circumference, and speedometer change. Safe and legal fitment also depends on load index, speed symbol, wheel width, offset, suspension and body clearances, and local regulations. Organisations such as the European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation (ETRTO) and government agencies emphasize that replacement tires should match or exceed the original load and speed ratings and follow manufacturer-approved size alternatives. Always confirm fitment with a qualified tire professional or the vehicle manufacturer."
            },
            {
                "question": "How much tire diameter change is acceptable for my speedometer?",
                "answer": "There is no single global rule, but many technical sources and manufacturer bulletins consider diameter changes on the order of a few percent as the upper limit before speedometer recalibration or additional engineering review is advised. For example, some manufacturers publish service bulletins explaining how to recalibrate the speedometer after small tire size changes. You should follow the recommendations in your owner’s manual and any guidance issued by the vehicle manufacturer or relevant transport authority."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does this calculator account for load index, speed rating, and tire construction?",
                "answer": "The calculator itself only uses size dimensions (width, aspect ratio, rim diameter) to compute geometry and speedometer effects. However, when you choose a replacement tire size, you must also ensure that the load index and speed symbol meet or exceed the original equipment specifications, and that the tire type is appropriate for the vehicle and usage. These requirements are discussed in standards and recommendations from ETRTO, ISO passenger car tyre standards, and national safety agencies."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I use this tool for off-road, light truck, or flotation tire sizes?",
                "answer": "This tool is optimized for metric passenger car sizes. Some off-road and light truck tires use different sizing systems, such as flotation sizes (for example 33×12.50R17), where the leading number already approximates overall diameter in inches. While the same geometric principles apply, the inputs and interpretation differ, and you should refer to the tire manufacturer’s technical data for those applications."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the best way to validate the calculator results on my own vehicle?",
                "answer": "After selecting a candidate tire size, you can compare the calculated diameter and revolutions per mile with values from the tire manufacturer’s data sheet. Once the tires are fitted, you can check speedometer accuracy by comparing the indicated speed to a calibrated reference such as certified speed measurement equipment or high-quality GPS-based speed readouts while driving at a steady speed on a safe, legal test section of road. Always follow local traffic laws and safety guidance when performing any on-road checks."
