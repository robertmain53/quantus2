    "introduction": [
      "This converter computes the monetary discount and the final sale price when you supply an original price and a percentage discount. It is intended for retail, budgeting, and bookkeeping use cases where a single percentage discount is applied to a base price.",
      "The tool applies a single fixed percentage to the provided original price. It does not automatically apply taxes, multiple sequential discounts, coupon stacking rules, or region-specific rounding unless those adjustments are done externally."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculation uses direct arithmetic: discount amount equals original price multiplied by the discount rate expressed as a decimal fraction; final price equals original price minus the discount amount.",
      "Numeric operations follow conventional floating-point arithmetic behavior as defined by the IEEE 754 standard. For high-integrity financial or regulatory reporting, results should be reconciled with your accounting system and rounded according to local rules."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Discount amount = original_price * (discount_rate_percent / 100)",
      "Final price = original_price - Discount amount",
      "Equivalent: Final price = original_price * (1 - discount_rate_percent / 100)"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Original price $120.00 with 25% discount -> Discount amount = 120 * 0.25 = $30.00; Final price = $90.00.",
      "Original price $49.99 with 15% discount -> Discount amount ≈ 49.99 * 0.15 = 7.4985 -> Final price ≈ 42.4915 (user interface typically rounds to cents -> $42.49)."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Enter the original price and the discount percentage to get the discount amount and final price. Use the results as a quick reference; for accounting entries or legal pricing notices, follow your organisation's rounding and disclosure rules."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Can I use this tool for stacked or sequential discounts?",
        "answer": "No. This converter applies a single percentage discount to one base price. For sequential discounts, apply each discount step-by-step and use the result of one step as the input to the next, or use a specialized multi-step calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the calculator include sales tax or other fees?",
        "answer": "No. Taxes and additional fees are not included. Apply taxes after computing the discounted price if required by your jurisdiction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are the numeric results?",
        "answer": "Calculations use standard floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754). Displayed currency values are presented in a rounded, user-friendly format. For audited financial records, reconcile and round according to your accounting policies and applicable standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need the original price given a final price and discount rate?",
        "answer": "You can rearrange the formula: original_price = final_price / (1 - discount_rate_percent / 100). Use a dedicated reverse-calculation tool or compute manually with that formula, taking care with division by zero when the discount rate is 100%."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any compliance or quality standards applicable to this calculator?",
        "answer": "This tool follows general best practices for numeric computation. For software quality management and operational controls, consult standards such as ISO 9001. For numeric and floating-point behavior, see IEEE 754. See the citations for authoritative references."
