    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a value expressed in liters (L) to cubic meters (m3). The liter is a derived SI-compatible unit equivalent to one cubic decimeter; the cubic meter is the SI base unit for volume.",
      "The numeric relationship used for the conversion is based on the International System of Units (SI). For practical measurement work, this tool reports the pure mathematical conversion; users should account separately for instrument calibration, measurement uncertainty, and any regulatory rounding rules that apply in their context."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion uses the exact SI relationship: 1 liter equals 0.001 cubic meters (1 L = 1 dm3 = 0.001 m3). This is an exact algebraic relationship defined by SI conventions.",
      "Accuracy for a reported converted value depends on the input value's precision and the measurement system used to obtain it. Round results according to the significant figures appropriate to your measurement or the regulatory standard you must follow.",
      "For regulated workflows (laboratory reporting, industrial inventories, safety data sheets), verify rounding and reporting rules against relevant standards and workplace procedures. This tool does not replace formal calibration records or certified measurement uncertainty evaluations."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the input in liters (L).",
      "Step 2: Multiply the input by 0.001 to convert to cubic meters: cubic meters = liters × 0.001.",
      "Concise formula: m3 = L × 0.001. Because the relationship is defined within SI, the factor 0.001 is exact; uncertainty arises from the measured input, not from the conversion factor."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Example 1: 250 L → 250 × 0.001 = 0.25 m3.",
      "Example 2: 1,000 L → 1,000 × 0.001 = 1.0 m3."
    ],
    "summary": [
      "Use this converter for quick, exact conversions between liters and cubic meters. Remember that while the conversion factor is exact, real-world measurement uncertainty and reporting rules must be considered separately."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "Yes. By definition under the SI system, 1 liter equals 1 cubic decimeter which equals 0.001 cubic meters. The factor 0.001 is exact; any numerical uncertainty comes from the measured input value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I report?",
        "answer": "Report results with a number of significant figures that reflect the precision of your original measurement and any relevant regulatory or laboratory reporting requirements. When in doubt, preserve at least the input value's significant figures and follow applicable standards for rounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert negative values or extremely large values?",
        "answer": "Negative volumes are physically meaningful only in specific mathematical contexts; for measured physical volumes, ensure inputs are non-negative. Extremely large values can be converted mathematically, but verify that downstream systems accept the magnitude and that any regulatory limits or safety thresholds are respected."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool account for temperature or pressure?",
        "answer": "No. Liter and cubic meter are units of geometric volume; however, for gases and temperature/pressure-dependent densities, convert measured quantities accounting for standard conditions separately. This converter only changes numeric units, it does not apply thermodynamic corrections."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I document conversions for compliance or audits?",
        "answer": "Record the original measurement with its units, the date, the measurement device and calibration status, the number of significant figures used, and the converted value with its units. Reference applicable standards or organizational procedures when preparing formal reports."
