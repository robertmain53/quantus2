    "introduction": [
      "This calculator estimates periodic payments, total interest, and total cost for a motorcycle purchase financed by a loan. It supports monthly, bi‑weekly and weekly payment schedules and lets you add down payment, sales tax, one‑time fees, and optional extra payments per period.",
      "Results are estimates intended for planning. Lenders may use slightly different rounding, compounding conventions, or disclose APR differently. Confirm the lender's amortization schedule and disclosure for final figures."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The calculator converts the annual percentage rate (APR) to a periodic rate by dividing by the selected payments per year (12, 26, or 52). It then computes the standard amortizing payment using the annuity formula when interest is nonzero, or a simple division if rate is zero.",
      "Sales tax and one‑time fees are added to the financed amount unless otherwise excluded by the lender. Down payment reduces the financed amount. Optional extra payments are added to each period and accelerate payoff, reducing total interest in practice."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Financed principal = principal - down_payment + fees + principal × (sales_tax_percent / 100).",
      "Periodic rate r = (annual_interest_rate / 100) / payments_per_year.",
      "Number of payments n = term_years × payments_per_year.",
      "When APR is above zero: periodic payment = financed_principal × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1) + extra_payment.",
      "When APR is zero: periodic payment = financed_principal divided by n plus extra_payment.",
      "Total paid = periodic_payment × n. Total interest = total_paid minus financed_principal.",
      "Equivalent monthly payment = periodic_payment × (payments_per_year / 12) for comparison only."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why does bi‑weekly look like it reduces interest?",
        "answer": "Bi‑weekly schedules make 26 payments per year (two every month plus two extra per year) which results in more frequent principal reduction compared with a 12‑payment schedule of equal per‑month amount. That accelerates payoff and reduces interest, assuming payment amounts are derived from the annuity formula for the chosen frequency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator compute APR or finance charge disclosures?",
        "answer": "This tool estimates payments and total interest based on the inputs. APR disclosures and finance charge calculations are governed by regulation and lender-specific rounding; use the lender's official disclosure for legally binding APR and finance charge values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are taxes and fees always financed?",
        "answer": "Not always. Some lenders require upfront payment of taxes or fees, or treat trade‑in differently. This calculator assumes sales tax and fees are added to the financed amount by default; adjust inputs to match your lender's treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these results?",
        "answer": "Results are numerical estimates. They follow standard annuity formulas but do not replace lender amortization schedules. Precision depends on the accuracy of inputs and assumptions about compounding/rounding. For high‑stakes decisions, compare with your lender's amortization and disclosures."
