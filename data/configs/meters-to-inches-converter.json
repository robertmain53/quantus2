    "introduction": [
      "This converter converts a length entered in metres (m) to inches (in) using the internationally agreed exact relationship between the metre and the inch. Enter a single numeric value in metres to receive the equivalent length in inches.",
      "The tool uses the exact definition of the inch (1 inch = 0.0254 metres) so results are mathematically precise. Practical measurement accuracy depends on the measuring instrument, calibration, and how many significant figures you choose to display."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is based on the international definition where one inch is exactly 0.0254 metres. This definition is maintained by national metrology institutes and reflected in international standards.",
      "For reporting and practical use, numerical results are typically rounded to a sensible number of significant figures based on measurement uncertainty. Users should consider instrument resolution and calibration (see NIST and ISO standards) before choosing rounding or precision for real-world measurements."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Use the exact relationship: 1 inch = 0.0254 metre, therefore 1 metre = 1 / 0.0254 = 39.37007874015748 inches.",
      "Conversion formula (preferred): inches = metres ÷ 0.0254.",
      "Equivalent multiplication formula: inches = metres × 39.37007874015748. Round output to the number of significant figures appropriate for your measurement context."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "0.01 metre → 0.3937007874015748 in (0.3937 in when rounded to 4 decimal places)",
      "1 metre → 39.37007874015748 in (39.37 in when rounded to 2 decimal places)",
      "2.5 metres → 98.4251968503937 in (98.43 in when rounded to 2 decimal places)"

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Why is the conversion factor exact?",
        "answer": "The inch is defined internationally as exactly 0.0254 metres. This is an agreed fixed relationship, so the mathematical conversion factor is exact and not subject to measurement error. Practical uncertainty arises from the instruments used to measure lengths in the field."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many decimal places should I use?",
        "answer": "Choose decimal places based on the precision of your measurement device and required reporting accuracy. For engineering drawings or lab work, follow your project's measurement uncertainty and significant-figure rules. For approximate everyday use, two decimal places are often sufficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement error or calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a mathematical unit conversion only. It does not model instrument uncertainty, calibration offsets, thermal expansion, or other physical effects. For critical measurements, follow calibration procedures and applicable standards such as those published by NIST and ISO."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert centimetres or millimetres to inches?",
        "answer": "Convert centimetres to metres by dividing by 100, and millimetres to metres by dividing by 1000, then convert metres to inches using this converter. Alternatively, use the equivalent direct factors: 1 cm = 0.3937007874 in and 1 mm = 0.03937007874 in."
