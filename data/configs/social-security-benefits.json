      "This tool provides an estimate of monthly retirement and spousal benefits using an AIME → PIA bend-point approach and claim-age adjustments. It is intended for planning and illustration only and does not substitute for official benefit statements.",
      "Defaults and bend points update periodically; enter your own indexed earnings or conservative averages for more accurate results. Use the quick estimate for rapid budgeting and the PIA-based method for a closer approximation."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "Primary estimates use a three-tier PIA bend-point formula applied to an average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) approximation. Bend points are inputs so the calculator can be kept current each year.",
      "Claim-age adjustments approximate standard early reduction rules: a higher proportional reduction for the first 36 months before full retirement age and a smaller per-month reduction thereafter. Delayed retirement credits are not modeled in detail in the quick method, but the PIA-based method can be extended.",
      "This tool is designed with security and reliability practices in mind. Development and hosting should follow NIST risk management guidance, ISO 27001 principles for information security, and IEEE best practices for numerical software validation."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Approximate AIME = average annual earnings / 12.",
      "Step 2: Compute PIA = 0.9×min(AIME, bend1) + 0.32×min(max(AIME−bend1,0), bend2−bend1) + 0.15×max(AIME−bend2,0).",
      "Step 3: Calculate months claimed before FRA and apply early reduction = (first 36 months × 5/9% per month) + (remaining months × 5/12% per month).",
      "Step 4: Adjust PIA by (1 − early reduction) to estimate monthly benefit at chosen claim age. Spousal entitlement = max(0, 0.5 × primary PIA − spouse’s own PIA), then apply spouse claim-age adjustment similarly."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate are these estimates?",
        "answer": "Estimates are approximations for planning purposes. They depend on the accuracy of the earnings input and bend-point values. This tool does not account for detailed indexed earnings history, cost-of-living adjustments, or every special rule. See the accuracy caveats and official benefit statements for precise amounts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I choose bend-point values?",
        "answer": "Bend points change annually. Use the official published monthly bend points for the year in question when available. If unknown, use the defaults but treat results as approximate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this calculator account for delayed retirement credits?",
        "answer": "The PIA-based method can be extended to model delayed retirement credits, but this configuration focuses on estimating PIA and early-claim reductions. For scenarios with delayed claiming beyond FRA, consider adding explicit delayed-credit factors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rely on this for legal or benefit entitlement decisions?",
        "answer": "No. Use this calculator for financial planning only. For definitive benefit entitlement and exact amounts, consult official statements or agency channels."
