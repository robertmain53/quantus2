    "introduction": [
      "This converter translates frequencies expressed in gigahertz (GHz) into hertz (Hz) using the International System of Units (SI) prefix definition. The relationship between GHz and Hz is fixed and exact within the SI framework, so conversions are deterministic and suitable for calculations, documentation, and data processing.",
      "Use this tool to convert radio, microwave, optical, and electronic timing values when preparing specifications, simulation inputs, lab notes, or regulatory filings. The guidance here aligns with international measurement practice and national metrology institutions.",
      "When applying results to measurements, also consider instrument resolution and calibration uncertainty; the numerical conversion does not substitute for metrological traceability or measurement uncertainty reporting."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The converter applies the SI prefix scale: the prefix giga- denotes 10^9. Converting from gigahertz to hertz therefore multiplies the input by 1,000,000,000.",
      "Results are presented numerically and as scientific notation when appropriate. For laboratory and regulatory use, retain significant figures consistent with measurement uncertainty and instrument resolution. For formal traceability, follow guidance from national metrology institutes for calibration and uncertainty reporting.",
      "This tool performs a unit conversion only and does not measure frequency or estimate measurement uncertainty. For calibrated measurements, consult accredited metrology laboratories or device calibration certificates."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Step 1: Take the value in gigahertz (GHz).",
      "Step 2: Multiply by 1,000,000,000 (10^9) to convert to hertz (Hz).",
      "Concise formula: Hz = GHz × 10^9 (for example, 2.4 GHz = 2.4 × 10^9 Hz = 2,400,000,000 Hz)."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "1 GHz → 1,000,000,000 Hz (1 × 10^9 Hz).",
      "2.4 GHz → 2,400,000,000 Hz (2.4 × 10^9 Hz).",
      "0.001 GHz → 1,000,000 Hz (1.0 × 10^6 Hz)."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact relationship between GHz and Hz?",
        "answer": "1 gigahertz (1 GHz) equals 1,000,000,000 hertz (1 × 10^9 Hz). The relationship is defined by the SI prefix giga- = 10^9."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert fractional or very large GHz values?",
        "answer": "Yes. The conversion is linear and exact: multiply any numeric GHz value by 10^9. For very large or small results, use scientific notation to avoid formatting errors and to match engineering documentation practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I show after conversion?",
        "answer": "Match the number of significant figures to the precision of the original measurement or data source and to the resolution of the measuring instrument. When reporting measurements, include stated uncertainty rather than inflating precision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter account for measurement uncertainty or instrument calibration?",
        "answer": "No. This tool performs a mathematical unit conversion only. Measurement uncertainty and calibration traceability must be handled separately using calibration certificates and uncertainty budgets from accredited labs or national metrology institutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there regulatory considerations tied to frequency values?",
        "answer": "Yes. Frequency assignments, emissions limits, and band planning are regulated by national and international agencies. When converting values for regulatory filings or equipment specs, verify band allocations and limits with the relevant authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I format converted values for technical reports or code?",
        "answer": "For human-readable reports, use grouped digits or scientific notation with an appropriate number of significant figures. For programmatic use, prefer scientific notation (e.g., 2.4e9) to avoid locale-specific formatting issues."
