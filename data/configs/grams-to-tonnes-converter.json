    "introduction": [
      "This converter performs a direct metric conversion from grams (g) to metric tonnes (t). The metric tonne (also spelled 'tonne') is defined as exactly 1,000 kilograms, which equals 1,000,000 grams.",
      "Use this tool for quick unit conversion when working with laboratory masses, shipping weights expressed in metric units, or engineering calculations. For regulated measurement, check calibration and uncertainty guidance from national and international standards bodies."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "The conversion is a fixed mathematical relationship in the International System of Units (SI): 1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms = 1,000,000 grams. The converter applies that exact factor without added empirical corrections.",
      "When converting measured values, the result's meaningful precision depends on the input measurement's uncertainty and the measuring instrument's calibration. Always retain and report significant figures consistent with the instrument's accuracy and applicable standards.",
      "For compliance and traceability in trade, safety, or regulated reporting, follow NIST and ISO guidance on measurement uncertainty, calibration, and unit notation. For manual handling and workplace limits, consult occupational safety guidance."
    ],
    "how_is_calculated": [
      "Formula: tonnes = grams ÷ 1,000,000",
      "Inverse formula: grams = tonnes × 1,000,000",
      "Steps: take the numeric value in grams, divide by one million to obtain metric tonnes; round the output only to the number of significant digits justified by the input measurement uncertainty."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "5,000,000 g → 5 t (5,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 5)",
      "250 g → 0.00025 t (250 ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.00025)",
      "1,234,567 g → 1.234567 t (1,234,567 ÷ 1,000,000 = 1.234567)"
    ],
    "summary": [
      "This is an exact metric conversion using the SI definition of the tonne (1 t = 1,000,000 g).",
      "For reported results, control rounding and significant figures based on measurement uncertainty and calibration certificates.",
      "Consult standards for traceability and regulatory requirements when conversions support safety, trade, or compliance."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the exact conversion factor between grams and tonnes?",
        "answer": "One metric tonne equals 1,000,000 grams. To convert grams to tonnes divide by 1,000,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many significant figures should I keep when converting?",
        "answer": "Keep as many significant figures as are supported by the original measurement and the instrument's calibration. Do not imply greater precision than the measurement uncertainty allows; follow NIST and ISO guidance on significant figures and uncertainty reporting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a tonne the same as a ton?",
        "answer": "A metric tonne (t) equals 1,000 kilograms. Other 'ton' definitions exist: the short ton (commonly used in the United States) equals 2,000 pounds (~907.18474 kg) and the long ton (UK) equals 2,240 pounds (~1,016.0469 kg). Use this converter for metric tonnes only."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert very large or very small numbers reliably?",
        "answer": "Yes; the mathematical relationship is exact. For extremely large or small values, use appropriate numeric formatting (scientific notation) and ensure downstream systems can handle the scale without rounding or overflow."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to calibrate scales before converting?",
        "answer": "Conversion itself does not require calibration, but any mass measurement used as input should come from a calibrated instrument if you need traceable, legally defensible, or safety-critical values. Refer to NIST and ISO standards for calibration intervals and procedures."
