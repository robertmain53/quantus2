    "introduction": [
      "This cups to milliliters converter provides precise volume conversions essential for cooking, baking, and accurately following recipes from different regions.",
      "Our tool defaults to the US customary cup (236.59 mL) but also explains the US legal cup (240 mL) used for nutrition labeling, giving you the context needed for any application.",
      "Avoid measurement errors by using the correct, standards-based conversion, complete with worked examples and expert guidance on when each type of cup is used."
    ],
    "methodology": [
      "To convert US customary cups to milliliters (mL), the calculator multiplies the cup value by 236.5882365. This is the standard for recipe conversions.",
      "This value is derived from the definition of the US liquid gallon (3.785411784 liters), where 1 US customary cup is exactly 1/16th of a US gallon.",
      "For nutrition labeling in the United States, the US legal cup is used, which is defined by the FDA as exactly 240 mL. This calculator uses the customary cup, which is more common for home cooking."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Baking: A recipe calls for 2 cups of milk. This converts to approximately 473 mL, ensuring the liquid ratio is correct for the desired consistency.",
      "International Recipes: A European recipe requires 300 mL of water. This is equivalent to about 1.27 US customary cups, allowing a US-based cook to adapt the recipe accurately.",
      "Liquid Measurement: Converting 1.5 cups of oil for a salad dressing yields 355 mL."
    ],
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How many mL are in a US cup?",
        "answer": "There are two common measurements. A US customary cup, used for cooking, is approximately 236.59 mL. A US legal cup, used for nutrition labels, is exactly 240 mL."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the formula to convert cups to mL?",
        "answer": "The formula for a US customary cup is: Milliliters = Cups × 236.5882365. For a US legal cup, it is: Milliliters = Cups × 240."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a metric cup the same as a US cup?",
        "answer": "No. A metric cup, used in countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, is defined as 250 mL. This is different from both the US customary (236.59 mL) and US legal (240 mL) cups."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this converter work for dry ingredients like flour?",
        "answer": "This tool converts volume (cups to mL). While you can measure a cup of flour, its weight in grams will vary based on density. For precise baking, using a kitchen scale and a cups-to-grams converter for the specific ingredient is recommended."
