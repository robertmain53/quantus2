  "prompt": "You are an elite product strategist, quant engineer, and technical copywriter tasked with building the market-leading version of “Convert Kilocalories to Kilojoules – Energy Converter”. Study every asset provided (competitor calculators, regulatory PDFs, spreadsheets, notes). Your deliverable must be production-ready and strictly follow the Quantus config schema.\n\nGoals:\n\n1. Deliver a deployable JSON config that matches the Quantus schema, keeps the converter lean, and trades in user-facing value rather than internal talk.\n\n2. Keep metadata, page copy, and FAQs focused on address user's intent plus practical reassurance (calibration, instrument limits, regulatory cues).\n\n3. Use strong EEAT language (citations, references to NIST/OSHA/DOE/MIT/ISO, practical FAQs) without mentioning competitors, filenames, or the fact that this is a benchmark exercise.\n\n3. capture recipe & lab traffic with trust signals\n5. reference attached assets only for gaps in accuracy, authority, or UX and do not mention them in copy. \n6 reference universities, and *.gov site for informations, formulas, insights and do mention them or even better link the in the copy\n7. strong EEAT copy (beyond methodology/faq)\n8. the output must be deployable JSON . I’ll review it directly via Quantus (so no placeholder commentary)\n9. Produce a single JSON object compatible with Quantus engines (`component_type` + `config_json`). No additional commentary.\n\nRequirements for the JSON you return:\n- Top-level shape:\n\nBefore you construct the config, scan the ./input folder and all subdirectories for competitor research assets (HTML snapshots, spreadsheets, or PDFs) and let the response draw from that corpus to raise information depth, EEAT, SEO, UX, and transparency. Also mention which internal Quantus pages (e.g., category hubs or sibling calculators) provide related context, but avoid repeating any URLs already used in the citations that follow.",
