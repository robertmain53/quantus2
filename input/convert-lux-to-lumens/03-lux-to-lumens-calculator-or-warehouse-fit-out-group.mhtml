e light sources, that is, the =E2=80=9Camount=E2=80=9D of light emitted tha=
t is falling on an area. Illuminance in lux is, therefore, a vital planning=
 parameter for lighting systems.&nbsp;</p><h4>Lumens</h4><p>On the other ha=
nd, the brightness of your LED light fixture is usually expressed in lumens=
. This is the luminous flux emitted by the lamp in all directions. This may=
 also be expressed in watts (to determine brightness) in cases of conventio=
nal light sources.</p>

      <p>If you still find the above explanation a bit confusing, lux refer=

Now, whether we=E2=80=99re talking about lux or lumens, there are several f=
actors affecting these two units of measurement. These are the beam angle a=

gure out your&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://www.warehousefitoutgroup.co.uk/servic=
es/warehouse-led-lighting/exhibition-lighting">exhibition lighting</a>&nbsp=
;requirements, and the product only shows lumens or lux. Then a working kno=
wledge of how to convert one to the other would come in handy.&nbsp;</p><p>=
The total amount of visible light and distance is inversely proportional to=
 both the lux and lumens register. </p><p>That is, the larger the beam angl=
e and the distance, the lumen value per square foot decreases, and the illu=
minance or lux value decreases too. </p><p>On the other hand, a lamp of the=
 same brightness with a small beam angle or short distance has a larger lux=
 value.</p>

y, you don=E2=80=99t have to do everything manually. We found a reliable&nb=
sp;<a href=3D"https://lamphq.com/lux-lumens-conversion/"><u>calculator/conv=
erter</u></a>&nbsp;where you can just plug in the numbers and just await th=
e results.</p><h3>How to convert footcandles to lumens</h3><p>Aside from lu=
mens and lux, we also hear about another unit used to measure luminance: fo=
otcandles. Luckily for us, there is a straightforward conversion: 1 footcan=
dle is equal to 10.76 lux (SI unit). So, for example, you=E2=80=99re trying=
 to figure out the lux value of 2 footcandles, then you just multiply 2 by =
10.76. Thus, the lux value for that would be 21.52.</p><p></p><h3>How do yo=
u calculate lux per watt?</h3><p></p><p>Another unit of measurement that we=
 often hear and see on lighting products is watts. Unlike footcandles, conv=
erting watts to lux is a bit more complicated. If you want to take a crack =
at it, here=E2=80=99s the formula: lx =3D 10.76391 =C3=97 W =C3=97 (lm/W) /=
 ft2.</p><p></p><p>=E2=80=9CW=E2=80=9D represents the wattage, while =E2=80=
=9Clm/W=E2=80=9D refers to the lumens per watt. But due to the wonders of t=
he internet, you don=E2=80=99t have to calculate this manually (if you=E2=
=80=99re in a hurry). Here=E2=80=99s a link to the&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://=

      <h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p>We hope you learned something about conv=
erting lux and lumens. Learning to do the calculations manually may come in=
 handy, but if you like to get it done quickly, then the lux to lumens calc=
ulator will help you find a reference point for your lighting design. To be=
 really sure whether the desired illuminance is achieved with the installed=
 luminaires, it can be checked with a lux meter at the appropriate distance=
 from the light source.</p>
