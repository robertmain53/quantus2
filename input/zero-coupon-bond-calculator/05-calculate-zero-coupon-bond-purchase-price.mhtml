<p>Zero coupon bonds do not pay interest throughout their term. Instead int=
erest is accrued throughout the bond's term &amp; the bond is sold at a dis=
count to par face value. After a user enters the annual rate of interest, t=
he duration of the bond &amp; the face value of the bond, this calculator f=
igures out the current price associated with a specified face value of a ze=
ro-coupon bond. Interest is compounded semi-annually throughout the duratio=
n, or at the end of each fraction of a half-year for any fractional years r=
emaining.</p>

<h2>Calculator Usage Instructions</h2>
<div>
<p>Enter the face value of a zero-coupon bond, the stated annual percentage=
 rate (APR) on the bond and its term in years (or months) and we will retur=
n both the upfront purchase price of the bond, its nominal return over its =
duration &amp; its yield to maturity. </p>
<ul class=3D"cme-list">
  <li><strong>Entering Years:</strong> For longer duration bonds enter the =
number of years to maturity. </li>
  <li><strong>Entering Months:</strong> For shorter duration bonds enter th=
e number of months to maturity. </li>
  <li><strong>Entering Both:</strong> If you enter a set number of years AN=
D months then those figures are additive. For example:
    <ul class=3D"cme-list2">
      <li>5 years + 60 months =3D 10 years</li>
      <li>3.5 years + 3 months =3D 3 years 9 months</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h2>Example Zero-coupon Bond Formula</h2>
  <p><strong>P =3D M / (1+r)<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
  <p>variable definitions:</p>
  <ul class=3D"cme-list">
    <li>P =3D price</li>
    <li>M =3D maturity value</li>
    <li>r =3D annual yield divided by 2</li>
    <li>n =3D years until maturity times 2</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above formula is the one we use in our calculator to calculate the=
 discount to face value every half-year throughout the duration of the bond=
's term.</p>
  <p>Here is an example calculation for the purchase price of a $1,000,000 =
face value bond with a 10 year duration and a 6% annual interest rate.</p>
  <p><strong>$1,000,000 / (1+0.03)<sup>20</sup> =3D $553,675.75</strong></p=
>
  <h2>Calculating Yield to Maturity on a Zero-coupon Bond</h2>
  <p>YTM =3D (M/P)<sup>1/n</sup> - 1</p>
  <p>variable definitions:</p>
  <ul class=3D"cme-list">
    <li>YTM =3D yield to maturity, as a decimal (multiply it by 100 to conv=
ert it to percent)</li>
    <li>M =3D maturity value</li>
    <li>P =3D price</li>
    <li>n =3D years until maturity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's say a  zero coupon bond is issued for $500 and will pay $1,000 a=
t maturity in 30 years. Divide the $1,000 by $500 gives us 2. Raise 2 to th=
e 1/30th power and you get 1.02329. Subtract 1, and you have 0.02329, which=
 is 2.3239%.</p>
  <h2>Advantages of Zero-coupon Bonds</h2>
<p><img src=3D"https://calculator.me/savings/img/piggy-bank-savings-goal.pn=
g" alt=3D"Piggy Bank Reaching Savings Goal." width=3D"1250" height=3D"1040"=
></p>
<p>Most bonds typically pay out a coupon every six months. This makes typic=
al bonds a great source of income, though it limits their capital appreciat=
ion if &amp; when bond yields fall (as they often do during recessions, def=
lation &amp; strong disinflation).</p>

<p>Bond yields &amp; price move inversely. Thus if interest rates fall, any=
 outstanding bond which pays an interest rate above the current prevailing =
rate enjoys capital appreciation, since it is paying a higher rate than an =
investor could obtain by buying another similar bond at current rates.</p>

<p>Since zero coupon bonds do not pay a coupon, any capital appreciation re=
mains in the bond. Since they sell at a discount to their stated maturation=
 value they are known as discount bonds. In a falling rate envirnoment zero=
-coupon bonds appreciate much faster than other bonds which have periodic c=
oupon payments.</p>
<p>Bonds with a longer duration are more sensitive to the impact of interes=
t rate shifts.</p>

<p>Economist Gary Shilling <a href=3D"https://www.realvision.com/tv/shows/i=
nterviews/videos/the-market-can-remain-irrational-longer-than-you-can-remai=
n-solvent" target=3D"_blank">mentioned</a> holders of 30-year zero-coupon b=
onds purchased in the early 1980s outperformed the S&amp;P 500 with dividen=
ds reinvested by 500% over the subsequent 30-years as interest rates fell f=
rom around 14.6% to around 3%.</p>
<blockquote>=20
  <p>I started investing in 30 Year zero coupon treasuries. Now, zero coupo=
n bonds  don't pay any interest, but they are issued at a discount. And the=
 interest in effect is in effect built in the  difference between the issue=
 price which is below 100 and they're expiring at 100. It's built-in. Now, =
the  fact that it's built-in, it has big advantages when interest rates com=
e down. You don't have a reinvestment  risk. In other words, if you invest =
it, let's just take an example. Let's say you invest in a 10%  yielding sec=
urity and the rates dropped to 5%. Well, you've got to reinvest at 5%, you =
no longer can invest at 10%,  that's gone. But the <strong>zero coupons bui=
ld that in, so you get actually about twice as much appreciation for  given=
 declining interest rates with a zero coupon, as with a coupon bond, and th=
e longer the maturity, the  more bang for the buck. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Now, it works both ways. You'll lose more money if rates go up=
.</strong> But actually, I started in with the zero  coupon bonds from my o=
wn account in 1981. And by the mid-80s, the Shilling family, on that one  i=
nvestment, had achieved financial independence. And it's been a tremendous =
asset, as a matter of fact,  since the early '80s, and we have  documented =
that <strong>these zero coupon bonds have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by f=
ive times- that's including dividends in the S&amp;P</strong>, but a lot of=
 people, they think that Treasury  bonds are for little old ladies and orph=
ans. Well, I've never, never, never bought Treasury bonds for yield. </p>
  <p>I couldn't care less what the yield is as long as it's going down. Bec=
ause when it goes down, they increase  in price, and I bought it for the sa=
me reason most people buy stocks. Most people don't buy stocks for  dividen=
ds, you have some for utilities and real estate investments, but most peopl=
e are looking for  appreciation. And that's what my interest is in Treasury=
 bonds." - <a href=3D"https://www.realvision.com/tv/shows/interviews/videos=

<p>If 30-year interest rates are 14% a person would only need to spend $17,=
257.32 to buy a $1,000,000 face-value zero coupon bond. With interest rates=
 at 3% that math changes drastically, requiring a $409,295.97 payment to bu=
y the same instrument. That difference in price is capital appreciation. Th=
e following table shows how interest rates &amp; term impact the price &amp=

<h2>Disadvantages of Zero-coupon Bonds</h2>
<p>There are two major disadvantages of zero-coupon bonds.</p>

<p>The first disadvantage is they do not throw off=20


any income as the capital is stored in the bond. In some countries the impu=
ted interest may be taxed as income even though the bond has not yet been r=
edeemed or reached maturity.=20
The IRS requires zero-coupon bond holders to pay tax on the "phantom" imput=
ed interest income just as they would if they had received coupon payments,=
 even though there wasn't any interest paid to the bond holder.
</p><p>To calculate imputed interest, begin with the starting value of your=
 instrument &amp; then mutiply it by the yield to maturity to obtain the im=
puted interest for that year. For example, if you paid $5,000 for a 5-year =
bond &amp; it has an imputed interest of 2.337% then for the first year you=
 would calculate imputed interest as 2.337% of $5,000, or $116.85. For the =
subsequent years you would start with the base from prior years to calculat=
e the new imputed interest value.

</tbody></table>
<p>The above table presumes the insturment was held for throughout the dura=
tion of each calendar year. If the instrument was bought in the middle of t=
he year then imputed interest would need to be calculated for 6 different y=
ears with the first &amp; final years being partial year calculations based=
 on the percentage of the year where the instrument was held.
</p><p>The second major disadvantage is when interest rates rise significan=
tly they can see a drastic decline in capital value, as they have a signifi=
cant duration risk because no capital is paid out until the bond reaches ma=
turity (risk remains embedded in the instrument until it is redeemed). Bond=
s can be traded on the secondary market, with valuations reflecting the cur=
rent interest rate envirnoment. If you want to see what can happen in a ris=
ing rate environoment, look to the table above and see how a 30 year bond i=
ssued at 3% for $409,295.97 would only be worth around $227,283.59 if rates=
 suddenly rose to 5%. If rates remained relatively flat for 10 years &amp; =
then went to 5% the 30-year bond (with 20 years remaining) would only be wo=
rth $372,430.62 - meaning the bond owner would have paid income taxes on im=
puted interest for a decade only to see the bond be worth less than they pa=
id for it after holding it for a decade.
</p><h2>Treasury Instruments</h2>
<h3>Bills, Notes, Bonds</h3>
<p>Many people refer to any fixed-income treasury instrument as a bond, how=
ever the duration determines the specific name.=20
</p><ul class=3D"cme-list">
  <li><strong>Bills:</strong> These mature in 1 year or less. Due to their =
short duration they do not throw of a steady stream of interest payments, r=
ather they sell at a discount to their face value &amp; mature at par.</li>
  <li><strong>Notes:</strong> These mature between 2 to 10 years &amp; pay =
interest semi-annually.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> These have maturities beyond 10 years &amp; p=
ay interest semi-annually.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Longer duration bonds are more sensitive to shifts in interest rates. An=
d zero-coupon long duration bonds are more sensitive to rate shifts than bo=
nds which regularly pay interest.</p>
<p>Typically the yield curve is upward sloping with longer duration bonds o=
ffering a higher return to compensate for the added risk. When shorter dura=
tion bonds offer a higher yield than longer duration bonds that is called y=
ield curve inversion. If investors are willing to lock their money up for a=
 longer period of time at low rates it usually indicates they think there m=
ight be significant economic risks ahead. Inversion frequently happens anyw=
here from about 6 to 18 months before a recession happens. The most widely =
watched segment is the 2-year versus the 10-year. </p>
<p>10-year Treasury plays an important role in the economy, as 30-year fixe=
d-rate mortgage rates tend to closely follow shifts in the 10 year Treasury=
 note, trading at a slightly higher rate than the 10-year. Banks pay short-=
term deposit rates &amp; lend across longer duration loans, so when the yie=
ld curve significantly inverts it can hurt their profit margins &amp; make =
them less willing to lend. </p>
<p>Investors are allowed to invest up to $5 million in each marketable secu=
rity type when they bid in a noncompetitive auction. This limitatio does no=
t apply to rollover reinvestment.</p>

<h2>Other Treasury Marketable Securities</h2>
<p>Investors can also purchase inflation-protected Treasury securites (TIPS=
), US Treasury floating rate notes (FRN), as well as Treasury Strips. </p>
<ul class=3D"cme-list">
  <li><strong>TIPS:</strong> TIPS pay a regular semi-annual coupons while t=
he principal can be redeemed at the greater of the original principal amoun=
t or their inflation-adjusted equivalents. </li>
  <li><strong>FRN:</strong> Floating rate notes pay quarterly interest base=
d on discount rates for 13-week treasury bills, with the principal paid at =
maturity. </li>
  <li><strong>STRIPS:</strong> Strip bonds are explained in more detail in =
the following section. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Strip Bonds</h3>
<p>Investment bankers &amp; bond dealers have the ability to separate the c=
omponents of a traditional coupon-paying bond into the coupon &amp; the pri=
ncipal (or residue). The coupon payments &amp; residue can be sold separate=
ly to investors, creating additional zero-coupon bonds. </p>
<p>This process is called <em>stripping</em> &amp; <a href=3D"https://www.t=
reasurydirect.gov/instit/marketables/strips/strips.htm" target=3D"_blank">S=
TRIPS</a> stands for "Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal=
 Securities." It makes a lot of sense to hold these types of instruments in=
 tax-deferred retirement accounts so that they are not subject to annual in=
come taxes based on imputed interest.</p>
<h3>Savings Bonds</h3>
<ul class=3D"cme-list">
  <li><strong>Series EE:</strong> accrual-type security with a fixed intere=
st rate</li>
  <li><strong>Series I:</strong> accrual-type security which combines both =
a fixed interest rate &amp; the rate of inflation</li>
</ul>
<p>Each person may invest in up to $10,000 of Series EE or Series I bonds. =
Gift purchases are attributed to the recipient. </p>
<p>The Treasury also offers zero-percent certificate of indebtedness (C of =
I) which can be used to fund TreasuryDirect purchases.</p>
<h3>ETFs</h3>
<p>There are mutliple popular long-duration bond ETFs for investors seeking=
 to track the market in a liquid form without purchasing bonds directly.</p=

<p>If rates fall longer duration zero-coupon bonds will increase in value s=
ignificantly more than shorter duration federal government bonds &amp; fede=
ral bonds which pay a regular coupon. If rates rise the converse is true - =
zero-coupon bonds will be hit much harder than other bonds.</p>
<h2>Negative Yields</h2>
<p>After the financial crisis of 2008-2009 central banks became far more ag=
gressive participants in financial markets. Their goal was to provide liqui=
dity &amp; push investors out on the risk curve, hoping that asset price in=
flation would drive wealth effect spending that stimulates the economy. In =
some cases not only was the short end of the curve driven to zero, but some=
 countries like Germany &amp; Japan have negative rates going out 10 years.=
</p>
<p>Negative yields mean the lender pays the borrower to borrow. This has ne=
ver happened at a large scale in the history of humanity &amp; in June of 2=
019 <a href=3D"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-21/the-world=
-now-has-13-trillion-of-debt-with-below-zero-yields" target=3D"_blank">over=
 $13 trillion in bonds have negative yields</a> globally. </p>
<p>A negative yielding zero coupon bond would have an investor buying it at=
 above par, paying more than face value. As crazy as it sounds, negative yi=
elding bonds can still appreciate if rates go more negative than they alrea=
dy have, because that would mean bonds currently in circulation have higher=
 yields than newly issued bonds. </p>
