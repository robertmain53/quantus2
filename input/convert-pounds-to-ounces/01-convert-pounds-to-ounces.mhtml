<br><h3>Pound</h3><p><b>Definition:</b> A pound (symbol: lb) is a unit of m=
ass used in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. The inter=
national avoirdupois pound (the common pound used today) is defined as exac=
tly 0.45359237 kilograms. The avoirdupois pound is equivalent to 16 avoirdu=
pois ounces.</p><p><b>History/origin:</b> The pound descended from the Roma=
n libra, and numerous different definitions of the pound were used througho=
ut history prior to the international avoirdupois pound that is widely used=
 today. The avoirdupois system is a system that was commonly used in the 13=
<sup>th</sup> century. It was updated to its current form in 1959. It is a =
system that was based on a physical standardized pound that used a prototyp=
e weight. This prototype weight could be divided into 16 ounces, a number t=
hat had three even divisors (8, 4, 2). This convenience could be the reason=
 that the system was more popular than other systems of the time that used =
10, 12, or 15 subdivisions.</p><p><b>Current use:</b> The pound as a unit o=
f weight is widely used in the United States, often for measuring body weig=
ht. Many versions of the pound existed in the past in the United Kingdom (U=
K), and although the UK largely uses the International System of Units, pou=
nds are still used within certain contexts, such as labelling of packaged f=
oods (by law the metric values must also be displayed). The UK also often u=
ses both pounds and stones when describing body weight, where a stone is co=
mprised of 14 pounds.</p><h3>Ounce</h3><p><b>Definition:</b> An ounce (symb=
ol: oz) is a unit of mass in the imperial and US customary systems of measu=
rement. The avoirdupois ounce (the common ounce) is defined as exactly 28.3=
49523125 grams and is equivalent to one sixteenth of an avoirdupois pound.<=
/p><p><b>History/origin:</b> The origin of the term ounce stems from the Ro=
man uncia, which means a "twelfth part," and the use of a standardized copp=
er bar which defined both the Roman pound and foot. The copper bar was divi=
ded into twelve equal parts, called unciae. This relationship between the R=
oman pound and foot eventually contributed to the uncia being the basis of =
the modern inch as well as the common ounce. The ounce has been used as a s=
tandard of mass throughout history for different applications and with diff=
erent definitions. Examples include the Dutch metric ounce (100g), French o=
unce (30.59g), and the Spanish ounce (28.75g), among others. The current de=
finition of the ounce, the international avoirdupois ounce was adopted in 1=
959.</p><p><b>Current use:</b> The ounce is still a standard unit of mass i=
n the US customary system of measurement. It is mostly used in the United S=
tates for measuring packaged food products, food portions, and postal items=
, among other things. The ounce is still used in some other countries aroun=
d the world that have roots in British history and culture. Due to metricat=
ion, the United Kingdom (UK) no longer officially uses the ounce. It is how=
ever, still used in some settings in the UK, such as restaurants.</p><br><b=
