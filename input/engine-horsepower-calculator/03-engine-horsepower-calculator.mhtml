<h1>Engine Horsepower Calculator</h1>


<p>The following two calculators can be used to estimate the engine horsepo=
wer of a vehicle based on the weight of the vehicle, elapsed time, and spee=
d used to finish a quarter mile run. Vehicle weight should include not only=
 the vehicle, but also the driver, the passenger, and anything else of sign=
ificant weight. To estimate the peak horsepower, maximum work output should=
 be applied from start to finish. The results of all calculations are estim=
ations only.</p>

<br><h3>Precautions</h3>
<p>When measuring the elapsed time or trap-speed at the maximum work output=
 of an engine, special precautions need to be taken. First, all drivers nee=
d to know exactly what they're doing. Inexperience can lead to repercussion=
s, some of which can be serious and life-threatening. Second, do not measur=
e elapsed time on a quarter mile on public streets or highways; driving ove=
r the speed limit is illegal and the driver's attention needs to be focused=
 on driving, not measuring times. These activities can endanger not only th=
e driver, but other people as well. There are legal places to measure elaps=
ed time, such as on drag strips, rural roads that are privately owned, and =
during special events that take place at raceways or airports. Third, ensur=
e that the vehicle is in complete working order, as taking a vehicle to its=
 limits entails certain risks. Check that tires are properly inflated and s=
ecured soundly, that airbags are functional, and that the engine is properl=
y tuned and in good shape.</p>

<h3>What Is Horsepower?</h3>
<p>The idea of horsepower was created by the 19<sup>th</sup> century engine=
er James Watt, who built some of the first steam engines. Watt's work was r=
emarkable, and to honor him, his name was given to the unit of power, the w=
att (no, he didn't invent the light bulb, but his name is on every one).</p=
>
<p>Watt was working in a mine, using horses to pull wagons of coal. He want=
ed to determine how much coal a pony could pull in a wagon over a given len=
gth. He measured how many feet a horse could pull  22,000 pounds of coal in=
 one minute. He then increased that amount to 33,000 foot-pounds in a minut=
e, and called it horsepower.</p>
<p>It's a perfectly arbitrary amount, but it became the measure of how much=
 work engines could do =E2=80=93 no one had ever measured this before. So, =
imagine a horse pulling a wagon of coal out of a mine; with 1 horsepower of=
 effort, the horse pulls 330 pounds of coal 100 feet in one minute.</p>

<h3>Measuring Horsepower</h3>
<p>Horsepower is measured by a dynamometer, which is a rotor in a housing. =
It takes a certain amount of power to make the rotor go around at a certain=
 speed.</p>
<p>If you put a car into neutral, and then floor the engine while it is att=
ached to a dynamometer, the device puts a load on the engine and sees wheth=
er it can turn the load or how fast it can turn the load around. If you run=
 the engine at 5000 rotations per minute, (rpm), you see how much load turn=
s on the dynamometer to calculate horsepower.</p>
<p>Every engine has a peak horsepower =E2=80=93 an rpm value at which the p=
ower available from the engine is at its maximum. You will often see this e=
xpressed in a brochure or a review in a magazine as "320 HP @ 6500 rpm".</p=
>

<h3>Gross or Net Horsepower</h3>
<p>Gross horsepower is a measure of the work output of an engine on just a =
dynamometer, when the engine is not connected to the usual accessories appa=
rent in a running car. Net horsepower measures engine output when connected=
 to belt-driven accessories such as water pumps, power steering pumps, and =
alternators. There are also parasitic losses in power caused by transmissio=
n drag and clutch or converter slippage that net horsepower takes into acco=
unt. As a result of powering these moving parts, net horsepower can be cons=
iderably lower than gross horsepower.</p>

<h3>Horsepower Versus Torque</h3>
<p>Torque is defined as a rotating force. It's measured as the amount of fo=
rce multiplied by the length of the lever through which it acts. For exampl=
e, if you use a one-foot-long wrench to apply 10 pounds of force to a bolt =
head, you're generating 10-pound-feet of torque. Note that torque is measur=
ed in pound-feet, and horsepower is measured in foot-pounds per second.</p>
<p>Torque is the force that can be applied to push the vehicle forward. At =
a given vehicle weight, a high torque means the vehicle can accelerate fast=
er and is more responsive. Although not always true, generally, the more to=
rque produced by an engine, the more work potential it has. Similarly, an e=
ngine that produces more horsepower generally has a greater ability to gene=
rate higher torque.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between horsepower and torque clearer, th=
ink of the difference between a racing car and a tractor. A racing car is l=
ight, and so its high level of horsepower puts the torque through the geari=
ng system to make it go fast. A tractor, on the other hand, is a massive, h=
eavy piece of machinery that is intended to do work. The tractor can't go f=
ast, but its gearing applies torque so that it can push and pull. If you pu=
t the same high horsepower engine on a racing car and a tractor, the result=
 would be a speedy racing car, but not a vehicle that could break down a co=
ncrete wall. The slow tractor applies its work to pressure on the wall and =
breaks it down.</p>
<p>This is why, when you look up the specs for a car in an automobile magaz=
ine, you will see indications for both horsepower and torque.</p>

<h3>Horsepower and Performance</h3>
<p>What we call a "high-performance" car is just a vehicle with a lot of ho=
rsepower and a low weight; the power-to-weight ratio is the essential deter=
mination for a high-performance car. A typical example would be a Ferrari, =
which might have 800 horsepower on a 3,500 pound car. This puts the power-t=
o-weight ratio at about 0.229. In comparison, a Ford Explorer, which sells =
for about a tenth of the price of the Ferrari, might have about 300 horsepo=
wer to move about 4,500 pounds. Its power-to-weight ratio is much lower (ab=
out 0.067). The Ferrari will go from zero to 60 miles per hour much faster =
than the Ford Explorer.</p>
