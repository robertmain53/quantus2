<br>
<p>Business loans, like the name implies, are loans intended for business p=
urposes. Like other loans, the terms require the borrower to pay back both =
the principal and the interest. Most business loans will require monthly re=
payments, though some may call for weekly, daily, or interest-only payments=
. A select few can require repayment when the loans mature.</p>
<p>Business loans also come in many different forms. The following is a lis=
t of common loan options for U.S. businesses:</p>

<h3>SBA Loans</h3>
<p>Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, or loans federally regulated =
by the U.S. Small Business Administration, are designed to meet the financi=
ng needs of many different business types. Depending on the type of SBA loa=
n, borrowers can use them for various purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Business start-ups</li>
	<li>Acquisitions</li>
	<li>Working capital</li>
	<li>Real estate</li>
	<li>Franchise financing</li>
	<li>Debt refinancing</li>
	<li>Improvements</li>
	<li>Renovations</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual SBA loan funds are not provided by the government, but by ban=
ks, local community organizations, or other financial institutions. The SBA=
 guarantees these lenders 75% to 90% of the loan amount in case of default.=
 This encourages loans by reducing lender risk. However, SBA loans require =
additional paperwork and extra fees. Moreover, approval may take longer, an=
d their strict regulations tend to give business owners less freedom. Addit=
ionally, maximum loan limits may fall short of covering the more costly nee=
ds of some businesses.</p>

<h3>SBA Loan Types</h3>
<p>The SBA offers four types of small business loans:</p>
<p><b>7(a) Loan</b></p>
<p>This is the primary small business loan offered by the SBA, and it is us=
ually what one means when referring to an "SBA loan."</p>
<p>7(a) loans make up more than 75% of all SBA loans, and borrowers utilize=
 them for varied purposes. These may include working capital or different t=
ypes of purchases. Such acquisitions may consist of machinery, equipment, l=
and, or new buildings. Borrowers can also use the funds for debt financing.=
 They may take out loans as large as $5 million for up to 10 years for work=
ing capital or 25 years for fixed assets.</p>
<p><b>Microloan</b></p>
<p>These loans are intended for new or growing small businesses. Borrowers =
can utilize microloans for everything covered under 7(a) loans except payin=
g off existing debt or purchasing real estate. Lenders can approve microloa=
ns for as much as $50,000, though the average of these loans is no more tha=
n $15,000. The maximum allowable term is six years.</p>
<p><b>Real Estate &amp; Equipment Loan (CDC/504)</b></p>
<p>Borrowers typically take out CDC/504 Loans for long-term fixed-rate fina=
ncing of real estate or equipment and debt refinancing. Due to their limite=
d scope, they cannot utilize these loans for working capital or inventory. =
The maximum loan amount is $5.5 million with possible terms of 10, 20, or 2=
5 years.</p>
<p><b>Disaster Loan</b></p>
<p>Business owners can use these loans to repair machinery, property, equip=
ment, inventory, or business assets damaged or destroyed by a declared disa=
ster. The maximum loan amount is $2 million, and possible disasters can inc=
lude earthquakes, storms, flooding, fires (natural or man-made), or civil u=
nrest.</p>

<h3>Other Loan Types</h3>
<p><b>Conventional Loans</b></p>
<p>Most conventional business loans come from banks or other financial inst=
itutions. Unlike SBA loans, conventional loans do not offer governmental in=
surance for lenders. They typically involve higher rates and shorter terms.=
 Hence, borrowers with lower credit scores or a lack of available funding m=
ay find SBA loans more attractive. However, personal loans may carry low in=
terest rates for borrowers with excellent credit. Moreover, such loans invo=
lve a quicker, less regulated process, increasing their appeal to some borr=
owers.</p>
<p>Banks offer conventional loans in many different forms, such as mezzanin=
e financing, asset-based financing, invoice financing, business cash advanc=
es, and cash flow loans.</p>

<p><b>Personal Loans</b></p>
<p>Borrowers can sometimes use personal loans for small business purposes. =
In some cases, new businesses without established histories and reputations=
 may turn to such loans to avoid the high interest rates on business loans.=
 Refer to the <a href=3D"https://www.calculator.net/personal-loan-calculato=
r.html">Personal Loan Calculator</a> for more information or to run calcula=
tions involving personal loans.</p>

<p><b>Interest-Only</b></p>
<p>An interest-only loan differs from standard loans in that borrowers pay =
only interest for the duration of the loan. The entire principal balance co=
mes due at the loan's maturity date. An interest-only loan allows for lower=
 payments during the loan term and might make sense when borrowers expect h=
igher income in the future.</p>

<h3>Business Loan Fees</h3>
<p>Like many other types of loans, business loans usually involve fees besi=
des interest. Banks typically charge these fees to cover the costs of verif=
ying the borrower's information, filling out paperwork, and other loan-rela=
ted expenses. The most common fees are the origination fee and the document=
ation fee.</p>

<p><b>Origination Fee</b></p>
<p>Banks charge this fee for the processing and approval of a loan applicat=
ion, a process that may include verification of a borrower's information. B=
anks may apply a flat fee or a percentage of the loan amount, generally bet=
ween 1% and 6%. They often roll the origination fee into the cost of the lo=
an.</p>

<p><b>Documentation Fee</b></p>
<p>This is a common fee associated with loans that banks charge to cover th=
e cost of processing paperwork.</p>
<p>Besides the origination fee and documentation fee, some lenders may also=
 charge an application fee upfront to review the application.</p>
<p>Banks may also charge other fees over the course of the loan. These may =
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Monthly administrative fees</li>
	<li>Annual fees</li>
	<li>Service or processing fees</li>
	<li>Prepayment penalties</li>
	<li>Referral fees</li>
	<li>Late payment fees</li>
	<li>Wire transfer fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all lenders charge these fees. Also, some expenses, such as the late=
 payment fee or the prepayment penalty, will only apply in certain situatio=
ns.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>
<p>All these fees can make the actual cost or rate of the loans higher than=
 the interest rate given by the lenders. The calculator above can account f=
or these expenses and compute the loan's actual cost with fees included, al=
lowing borrowers to understand the full implications of taking out such a l=
oan.</p>
