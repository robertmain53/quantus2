<p>The first calculator above is designed to compute various parameters of =
a fixed-rate coupon bond issued or traded on the coupon date. The second ca=
lculator is used to determine the prices and accrued interest of fixed-rate=
 bonds not traded on the coupon date using common day-count conventions. It=
 is important to note that these calculators are specifically intended for =
use with fixed-rate coupon bonds, which represent the majority of bond type=
s. Additionally, it should be mentioned that in pricing bonds, these calcul=
ators do not account for other factors that can influence bond prices, such=
 as credit quality, supply and demand, and numerous other factors.</p>

<h3>What is a bond?</h3>
<p>A bond is a fixed-income instrument that represents a loan made by an in=
vestor to a borrower (typically a corporation or government entity). It ser=
ves as a means for organizations or governments to raise funds by borrowing=
 from investors. A bond specifies the terms of the loan and the payments to=
 be made to the bondholder.</p>
<p>Bonds come in various types to cater to the diverse needs of both invest=
ors and issuers. Each type comes with its own unique characteristics, risks=
, and benefits. The most common types include government bonds, municipal b=
onds, corporate bonds, and high-yield (junk) bonds, among others.</p>
<p>Relative to stocks, bonds are considered a lower-risk investment, making=
 them a popular choice among investors seeking a stable income stream while=
 preserving capital. However, the risk and return on bonds can vary widely,=
 depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer and the bond's duration. F=
or example, high-quality government bonds (such as U.S. Treasury bonds) are=
 typically viewed as safe investments while high-yield corporate bonds (als=
o known as junk bonds) carry higher risk.</p>

<h3>Bond structure</h3>
<p>The structure of a bond refers to its various components and characteris=
tics, which dictate how it functions as a financial instrument. Here's a br=
eakdown of the key elements in the structure of a bond:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Face value</b>=E2=80=94The face value, or par value, is the amount =
the bond issuer agrees to repay the bondholder at the bond's maturity. This=
 amount also serves as the basis for calculating interest/coupon payments.<=
/li>
	<li><b>Maturity date</b>=E2=80=94The maturity date is the point when the b=
ond's principal is due for repayment to the bondholder. Bonds can have shor=
t, medium, or long-term maturities spanning from less than a year to over 3=
0 years. The term "time to maturity" refers to the remaining period until t=
he bond reaches its maturity date.</li>
	<li><b>Coupon rate</b>=E2=80=94The coupon rate is the interest rate the bo=
nd issuer commits to paying on the bond's face value. Interest is typically=
 paid annually or semi-annually. Rates can be fixed, floating (adjustable),=
 or zero (as in zero-coupon bonds). The calculators above are designed excl=
usively for bonds with fixed coupon rates.</li>
	<li><b>Coupon payment frequency</b>=E2=80=94This refers to how often inter=
est payments are made to bondholders. Common frequencies for interest or di=
vidend payments include annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly schedul=
es.</li>
	<li><b>Yield</b>=E2=80=94The yield is a measure of the return an investor =
anticipates earning if the bond is held to maturity. Expressed as an annual=
 percentage, the yield is affected by the bond's purchase price, face value=
, coupon rate, and the time until maturity. There are several types of yiel=
ds that investors consider. The yield referred to in the above calculators =
is the current yield, which assesses the bond's coupon interest in relation=
 to its current market price, rather than its face value. The current yield=
 is calculated by dividing the annual coupon payment by the bond's current =
market price. This yield changes as the market price of the bond changes.</=
li>
	<li><b>Price</b>=E2=80=94The price of a bond is the amount it can be bough=
t or sold for in the financial markets. In essence, a bond's price reflects=
 the present value of its future coupon payments and the return of principa=
l at maturity, adjusted for the bond's credit risk, duration, and the curre=
nt interest rate environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond these core components, features such as the issuer, call and put =
options, credit rating, covenants, and marketability also play important ro=
les in a bond's valuation.</p>

<h3>How to calculate the bond price?</h3>
<p>Calculating the bond price involves discounting the future cash flows, w=
hich include interest payments and the principal repayment, to their presen=
t value using the required yield or discount rate. The bond price is the su=
m of the present values of all these cash flows. The basic formula for calc=
ulating the price of a bond is as follows:</p>
<p style=3D"text-align: center;"><img src=3D"https://d26tpo4cm8sb6k.cloudfr=
ont.net/img/bond/bond-price.svg" width=3D"263" height=3D"54" alt=3D"bond pr=
ice formula"></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p style=3D"padding-left: 20px;">
    C =3D the coupon payment per period,<br>
    N =3D number of periods until maturity,<br>
    r =3D the discount rate or yield per period,<br>
	F =3D the face value of the bond.
</p>
<div class=3D"panel">
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<p>Let's say we have a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5=
%, semi-annual payments, a maturity of 10 years, and we require a yield of =
6%.</p>
<p style=3D"padding-left: 10px;">
    Coupon payment per period (C) =3D 5% of $1,000 / 2 =3D $25<br>
    Number of periods (N) =3D 10 years =C3=97 2 =3D 20 periods<br>
    Discount rate per period (r) =3D 6% / 2 =3D 3% or 0.03
</p>
<p>The bond price is calculated by discounting each semi-annual payment and=
 the face value at maturity back to their present value, using a 3% per per=
iod rate. For this case, the calculated bond price is $925.61. This process=
 involves performing calculations for each payment and then summing them up=
, a task that can be complex without the aid of a financial calculator or s=
oftware. Our calculators above are designed to facilitate this purpose.</p>
</div>

<h3>Clean price and dirty price</h3>
<p>When calculating the price or present value of a bond, it is often assum=
ed that the bond trades or is issued on the coupon date. However, in realit=
y, bonds are mostly traded outside of the coupon dates. In the bond market,=
 the terms 'clean price' and 'dirty price' are used to distinguish between =
two ways of quoting the price of a bond outside the coupon date. These conc=
epts are crucial for understanding how bonds are traded and priced.</p>

<h4>Accrued interest</h4>
<p>Accrued interest of a bond is the interest that has accumulated on the b=
ond since the last interest payment date but has not yet been paid to the b=
ondholder. The accrued interest can be calculated using the formula:</p>
<p style=3D"text-align: center;"><img src=3D"https://d26tpo4cm8sb6k.cloudfr=
ont.net/img/bond/accrued-interest.svg" class=3D"scaleimg" alt=3D"accrued in=
terest formula"></p>

<h4>Clean price</h4>
<p>The clean price of a bond is the price that excludes any accrued interes=
t since the last coupon payment. When bonds are quoted in financial markets=
 and to the public, the clean price is typically used. This price reflects =
the market value of the bond itself, without considering any accrued intere=
st. The clean price is useful because it provides a standard way to compare=
 the prices of different bonds without the variability introduced by differ=
ing interest accrual periods.</p>

<h4>Dirty price (invoice price)</h4>
<p>The dirty price of a bond, also known as the invoice price, is the price=
 that includes the accrued interest on top of the clean price. The dirty pr=
ice is the actual amount paid by a buyer to the seller of the bond. Since b=
ondholders earn interest on a daily basis, if a bond is bought or sold betw=
een coupon payment dates, the buyer compensates the seller for the interest=
 income earned from the last coupon date up to the purchase date. This make=
s the dirty price a more accurate reflection of the bond's total value at a=
ny given point in time between coupon payments.</p>
<p>Based on the definitions above, the relationship between clean and dirty=
 prices can be summarized as:</p>
<p style=3D"text-align:center;">dirty price =3D clean price + accrued inter=
est</p>
<p>This formula highlights that the dirty price, which is the total price p=
aid by the buyer, includes both the clean price of the bond (its market val=
ue excluding accrued interest) and the accrued interest earned on the bond =
from the last coupon payment date up to the purchase date.</p>

<h4>Day-count conventions</h4>
<p>As seen in the accrued interest calculation formula above, the accrued i=
nterest is closely related to the methods of counting the number of days si=
nce the last coupon payment and the total days in a year. Day-count convent=
ions in the bond market are rules that determine how days are counted for t=
he calculation of interest that accrues over time on bonds. The main day-co=
unt conventions used in the bond market include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>30/360 (bond basis)</b>: This convention assumes that each month ha=
s 30 days and a year has 360 days. It simplifies interest calculations by s=
tandardizing the lengths of months, making it easier to calculate accrued i=
nterest manually. This convention is often used for corporate, agency, and =
municipal bonds in the United States.</li>
	<li><b>Actual/360 (A/360)</b>: Here, the actual number of days in the accr=
ual period is used, but the year is assumed to have 360 days. This conventi=
on is commonly used in money market instruments, such as commercial paper a=
nd short-term bank certificates of deposit.</li>
	<li><b>Actual/365 (A/365)</b>: This method uses the actual number of days =
in the accrual period but assumes a fixed year length of 365 days (although=
 leap years, which have 366 days, are usually not accounted for). It is com=
monly used for some government bonds outside the United States and in some =
interest rate swaps.</li>
	<li><b>Actual/Actual (A/A)</b>: This convention is used primarily for gove=
rnment bonds, including U.S. Treasury securities. It takes into account the=
 actual number of days in the accrual period and the actual number of days =
in the year, making it the most precise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different bonds may use different day-count conventions. The choice of d=
ay-count convention affects the calculation of accrued interest and, theref=
ore, the price of the bond when it is traded between coupon dates. The seco=
nd calculator above gives the option to select the day-count convention to =
use in the calculation. The accrued interest differences between different =
day-count conventions are normally very small. In extreme cases, it can hav=
e a difference of up to 6 days of accrued interest.</p>
