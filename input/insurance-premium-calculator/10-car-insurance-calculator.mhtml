<div><div><p>You can use the car insurance calculator to get an idea of you=
r coverage options and their costs. To get started, use the dropdown menus =
on the left column to enter some basic information, which the calculator wi=
ll then use to generate your estimate. </p>
<p>If there=E2=80=99s a term you=E2=80=99re unfamiliar with, you can check =
the definitions we=E2=80=99ve provided or use the tooltips in the calculato=
r by clicking on the navy circle with an =E2=80=9Ci=E2=80=9D symbol.</p>
<p>Once you=E2=80=99ve entered your information, your coverage options and =
limits will appear on the right side of the calculator. These numbers are a=
 starting point and can give you a point of reference for what you=E2=80=99=

<h3 class=3D"h4">State of residence</h3>
<p>When using the car insurance calculator, one of the first steps is to se=
lect your state of residence. The cost of insurance can vary significantly =
from state to state due to different required coverages and risk factors. T=
he calculator takes those differences into account.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Car ownership status</h3>
<p>Next, you can specify whether you own, <a href=3D"https://www.allstate.c=
om/resources/car-insurance/new-used-or-leased">lease or finance</a> your ve=
hicle. Your ownership status can influence the type and amount of coverage =
you might consider.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Value of your car</h3>
<p>The value of your vehicle helps the calculator determine the coverage ne=
eded for potential repairs or replacements. You'll simply need to select wh=
ether your vehicle value is more or less than $2,000.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Can you pay out of pocket to replace your car?</h3>
<p>If you can comfortably pay out of pocket to replace your vehicle, then y=

needs and requirements may also change. Using the car insurance calculator =
can help give you a baseline for the coverages you need when get a new car =
insurance quote. Here are a few common examples of when you may want to rev=
iew your car insurance.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Life events</h3>
<p>When you have big life changes, like moving or getting married, you may =
want to review your auto insurance policy.</p>
<p>If you relocate, insurance rates may change based on your new location's=
 risk factors and required coverages, particularly if you move to a new sta=
te. If you=E2=80=99re staying in-state, recalculating your coverage is wise=
 to ensure it remains suitable. If you=E2=80=99re moving out of state, a ne=
w car insurance policy will be required.</p>
<p>A change in your marital status can also impact insurance rates, potenti=
ally requiring adjustments to reflect your new circumstances.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Adding a new or used car</h3>
<p>If you get another vehicle for your household, your coverage requirement=
s could change. The calculator may help you figure out what sorts of covera=
ges to get for your new car.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Adding a child to your policy</h3>
<p>With a new driver in the household, coverage needs may change. Reviewing=
 and potentially adjusting your policy and level of protection may be advis=
ed.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Changes in time behind the wheel</h3>
<p>Significant changes in your daily commute or driving habits might lead t=
o adjustments in your coverage requirements. You may want to reevaluate you=
r level of protection using the calculator.</p>
<h3 class=3D"h4">Yearly review of coverages</h3>
<p>When these kinds of life events occur, your first thought may not be how=
 it=E2=80=99ll affect your car insurance. It=E2=80=99s smart to set a remin=
der to look at your policy once a year. Review your coverages, limits and d=
eductibles to make sure they=E2=80=99re all still right for you. Adjust any=
thing that may have changed, like your address, annual mileage, and members=
 of your household. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><di=

insurer for your situation, according to the <a href=3D"https://www.iii.org=
