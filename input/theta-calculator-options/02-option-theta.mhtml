            <div class=3D"inner"><h2 id=3D"definition">What Is Theta</h2>
<p>Options generally lose value with passing time. For example, an option w=
hich is worth $4.83 today may only be worth $4.79 tomorrow and $4.55 next w=
eek, without the market moving. This process is known as time decay. Theta =
measures the speed of time decay =E2=80=93 how much option premium will dec=
rease in one day.</p>
<h2 id=3D"example">Example</h2>
<p>Consider a $100 strike call option with 8 weeks (56 days) left to expira=
tion. Its underlying stock is trading at $101. The option's premium, curren=
tly at $4.83, consists of <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/intrinsic-v=
alue/" title=3D"Option Intrinsic Value Explained">intrinsic value</a> (101 =
=E2=80=93 100 =3D $1) and <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-time=
-value/" title=3D"Option Time Value Explained">time value</a> (4.83 =E2=80=
=93 1 =3D $3.83).</p>
<p>The option's theta is -0.04. It means the option premium will decrease b=
y 0.04 to $4.79 until the next day (as number of days to expiration decreas=
es by 1), <em>if everything else remains the same</em>. We could also say t=
he option's <em>time value</em> will decrease by 0.04 to $3.79, because pas=
sing time only affects time value; intrinsic value can change only if under=
lying stock moves.</p>
<p>Let's assume nothing happens in the market until the next day. The stock=
 stays at $101 and the option is indeed trading at $4.79. Now it has 55 day=
s left to expiration and theta of -0.04, indicating that the premium will d=
ecrease to $4.75 until the next day.</p>
<h2 id=3D"values">Theta Values</h2>
<p><strong>Options generally have negative theta =E2=80=93 lose value with =
passing time.</strong> There are some rare exceptions, but for now it is sa=
fe to take it as a universal rule.</p>
<p><a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/call-put-long-short-bull-bear/" ti=
tle=3D"Call, Put, Long, Short, Bull, Bear: Terminology of Option Positions"=
>Short option positions</a> have positive theta and benefit from time decay=
 (unless other factors like underlying price or <a href=3D"https://www.macr=
option.com/volatility/" title=3D"Volatility Tutorials">volatility</a> move =
against them).</p>
<p>There is no theoretical limit on how large an option's theta can be. In =
general, <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/in-at-out-of-the-money-optio=
ns/" title=3D"In the Money, At the Money, Out of the Money Options">at the =
money options</a> have greatest (most negative) theta, as they have more ti=
me value to decay than out of the money or in the money options.</p>
<p><a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-moneyness/" title=3D"Option=
 Moneyness Explained">Moneyness</a> (the relationship between underlying pr=
ice and strike price) is only one of several factors affecting theta. Like =
all the <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-greeks/" title=3D"Opti=
on Greeks: All Tutorials">other Greeks</a>, theta can also change with chan=
ging volatility, interest rates, or passing time. But before we discuss the=
se, let's make a quick note about theta sign.</p>
<h2 id=3D"sign">Positive or Negative Sign?</h2>
<p>There is some inconsistency in expressing theta among market practitione=
rs and resources. Some write it with positive sign (theta of 0.04 means the=
 option will lose $0.04 in one day), while others write it as negative numb=
er. We stick to the latter approach in this tutorial and website.</p>
<p>There are good logical reasons for either approach. The positive sign fo=
rmat fits better with <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/black-scholes/"=
 title=3D"Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model Tutorial">option model</a> mat=
hematics, where theta is the derivative of option premium with respect to t=
ime to expiration. When time to expiration increases (going back in time), =
option premium increases, and therefore the derivative must be positive. In=
 practical use, traders are rarely interested in what will happen to their =
position yesterday =E2=80=93 they are more concerned about the future. Nega=
tive sign is more consistent with the way traders normally read and work wi=
th theta, as well as the other Greeks =E2=80=93 a negative number means the=
 position will lose money.</p>
<p>Regardless of the sign you prefer, when we say "theta increases", we usu=
ally mean it in absolute terms =E2=80=93 the size of theta increases. For e=
xample, theta increases from -0.04 to -0.08, although mathematically it is =
incorrect. Similarly, we say that theta of -0.08 is "greater" than theta of=
 -0.04.</p>
<p>While all this attention to signs and wording may seem overly meticulous=
 when talking about a single option, it becomes more important with more co=
mplex portfolios composed of both long and short options, when the directio=
n of the aggregate exposure may not be immediately clear.</p>
<h2 id=3D"units">Theta Units</h2>
<p>Let's make another quick note about units. While theta is most commonly =
expressed as dollars per calendar day, some traders prefer trading days. Th=
ose with very long time horizon may measure theta in weeks, while short ter=
m traders or those working with options very close to expiration may measur=
e theta in hours or shorter intervals.</p>
<h3 id=3D"calendar-vs-trading-days">Calendar or Trading Days?</h3>
<p>Markets are closed on weekends and holidays. As a result, the number of =
trading days per year is much smaller (<a href=3D"https://www.macroption.co=
m/trading-days-per-year/" title=3D"Number of Trading Days per Year">252 on =
average in the US</a>) than the number of calendar days (365). Most option =
pricing models work with <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/black-schole=
s-time-to-expiration/" title=3D"Time to Expiration in the Black-Scholes Mod=
el">time in years</a> (time to expiration enters the model as % of year). A=
fter they calculate theta, they convert it to days by dividing by the numbe=
r of days per year. Dividing by 365 or 252 obviously leads to very differen=
t results.</p>
<p>While numerous academic papers have been written on which approach is mo=
re accurate (most tend to side with calendar days), neither is incorrect an=
d neither is perfect =E2=80=93 we must keep in mind that any model is just =
a simplified picture of reality. It is OK to use either calendar days or tr=
ading days. The only requirement is consistency and knowing what exactly yo=
ur theta figures mean.</p>
<p><strong>When using calendar days, theta means how much the option or por=
tfolio value will change in one calendar day. When using trading days, it i=
s per one trading day.</strong></p>
<p>With the formats and units out of the way, let's now explore how theta c=
hanges with passing time and changing volatility.</p>
<h2 id=3D"time">How Theta Changes with Passing Time</h2>
<p>The rate of time decay is not constant. Even when all the other factors =
(underlying price, volatility, interest rates) stay the same, theta changes=
 as an option gets closer to expiration. It can increase or decrease, depen=
ding on the option's moneyness.</p>
<p><strong>Theta of options which are near or at the money tends to increas=
e (in absolute terms) with passing time.</strong> When there are still seve=
ral months left before expiration, the rate of time decay is relatively slo=
w, and it accelerates as expiration approaches. At the money options have g=
reatest theta in the final days before expiration. If we measured theta for=
 infinitely short intervals instead of days, an at the money option's theta=
 would be infinitely large at the moment of expiration.</p>
<p><strong>Options which are further out of the money or deeper in the mone=
y tend to lose most of their time value earlier.</strong> With long time le=
ft to expiration, their theta may also increase with passing time. However,=
 as their remaining time gets closer to zero, theta starts to decrease, unt=
il both time value and theta get to almost zero. This can happen several we=
eks before expiration (the further from at the money the option is, the ear=
lier this happens). In the final days, far out of the money and deep in the=
 money options have virtually no time value left and no theta.</p>
<p>Note that although out of the money and in the money options lose a bigg=
er part of their (relatively small) time value earlier, at the money option=
s always have higher theta =E2=80=93 even with more time left to expiration=
, because their time value is much bigger to start with.</p>
<h2 id=3D"volatility">How Theta Changes with Volatility</h2>
<p>The effect of volatility on theta is simple: Higher volatility means mor=
e time value and higher theta, other things being equal.</p>
<h2 id=3D"trading">Theta Trading Considerations</h2>
<p>The idea of making money "automatically" from passing time can tempt som=
e inexperienced traders to treating positive theta strategies as sure ways =
to profits. Some resources describe such strategies, like <a href=3D"https:=
//www.macroption.com/short-straddle-payoff/" title=3D"Short Straddle Payoff=
 and Break-Even Points">short straddles</a> or <a href=3D"https://www.macro=
ption.com/iron-condor-payoff/" title=3D"Iron Condor Payoff, Break-Even Poin=
ts and R/R">iron condors</a>, as "income strategies", which may further con=
tribute to this illusion.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that <strong>mere passage of time can neve=
r, on its own, generate returns higher than the risk-free interest rate</st=
rong>.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that positive theta strategies are bad. Indeed, some o=
f them have shown very good risk-adjusted performance in a wide range of un=
derlying markets in the long run. However, the source of their profits is n=
ot passage of time itself; it is <strong>passage of time combined with misp=
riced volatility</strong>.</p>
<p>Options on many underlyings tend to trade at inflated prices, higher tha=
n what actual <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/historical-volatility/"=
 title=3D"Historical Volatility Tutorials and Reference">realized volatilit=
y</a> would justify. This is called volatility risk premium.</p>
<p>An iron condor is not a good trade just because it has positive theta. I=
t is a good trade if (and only if) you can make it at a good price, or in o=
ther words, if the positive theta is large enough to compensate you for the=
 risk of <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-gamma/" title=3D"Opti=
on Gamma">negative gamma</a>. Being able to make such decision requires exp=
erience and good understanding of volatility, option prices and Greeks.</p>
<h2 id=3D"theta-gamma-relationship">Theta and Gamma Relationship</h2>
<p>You can think of theta (time decay) as the other side of gamma (optional=
ity). These two Greeks represent the cost and benefit of options.</p>
<p>Long option positions generally have negative theta and positive gamma (=
you pay for buying optionality).</p>
<p>Short option positions have positive theta and negative gamma (you get p=
aid for providing optionality).</p>
<p>Positive theta is good: you make money with passing time. Negative theta=
 is bad.</p>
<p>Positive gamma is good: if the underlying price moves in your favor, <a =
href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-gamma/#trading" title=3D"How gamm=
a accelerates profits and slows down losses">your profits accelerate</a>; i=
f it moves against you, your losses slow down. Negative gamma is bad: accel=
erating losses and decelerating profits.</p>
<p>An ideal position would have positive gamma and positive theta. Unfortun=
ately, there is no such <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-strate=
gies/" title=3D"Option Strategy Tutorials">option strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Every strategy has strengths and weaknesses. It can position you favorab=
ly to either market moves or passage of time =E2=80=93 but not both, as one=
 pays for the other. Option theta and gamma provide quick information on wh=
ere you are in this tradeoff.</p>
<h2 id=3D"calculation">How to Calculate Theta</h2>
<p>Mathematically, theta is the derivative of option premium with respect t=
o time to expiration (multiplied by -1 when using the negative sign as we d=
o here). This tutorial focuses mainly on the logic and practical use of the=
ta. If you are interested in the mathematics, you can find exact theta form=
ulas in <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/black-scholes-formula/" title=
