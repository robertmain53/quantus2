<h3>Tire code</h3>
<p>Car tires are described by an alphanumeric code, as shown in the figure =
below. Being able to read the tire code can be important, particularly when=
 considering getting new wheels or tires, as being able to read the tire co=
de is necessary for calculating things like tire size. Each part of the cod=
e describes some characteristic of the tire; refer to the figure below.</p>
<p style=3D"text-align:center;"><img src=3D"https://d26tpo4cm8sb6k.cloudfro=
nt.net/img/tire-code.png" width=3D"456" height=3D"322" alt=3D"tire code" cl=
ass=3D"scaleimg"></p>
<p><b>Intended use:</b> The first part of the code is made up of 1 or 2 let=
ters (P, LT, ST, T) that describe the type of vehicle that the tire is inte=
nded to be used with. There are 4 vehicle classes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>P</b> stands for passenger car. Tires with the P specification are =
intended for use with cars, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, and smaller pickup =
trucks.</li>
	<li><b>LT</b> stands for light truck. Tires with the LT specification are =
designed to carry heavy loads and are capable of towing trailers.</li>
	<li><b>ST</b> stands for special trailer. These types of tires are used fo=
r trailers such as boat trailers, utility trailers, and travel trailers.</l=
i>
	<li><b>T</b> stands for temporary. Tires with the T specification are usua=
lly spare tires that are not intended for everyday use.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Nominal section width:</b> The second part of the code is a 3-digit n=
umber that describes the nominal section width of the tire in millimeters (=
mm). The nominal section width is the widest point of the tire or the width=
 from sidewall to sidewall. In the figure above, the 215 means that the nom=
inal section width of the tire is 215 mm.</p>
<p><b>Aspect ratio:</b> The next part of the code follows the forward slash=
 ( / ). It is a 2- or 3-digit number that indicates the ratio of the tire's=
 section height to its width. The section height is the height of the tire =
measured from the rim to the outer edge of the tire; the section width is t=
he width from sidewall to sidewall. A tire with the code xxx/65 indicates t=
hat the section height of the tire is 65% of its width. For example, for a =
tire with code 200/65, the section height is 200 =C3=97 65% =3D 130 mm.</p>
<p><b>Internal construction:</b> The next part of the code is a single lett=
er (B, D, R) that indicates the internal construction of the tire. The insi=
de of a tire is made up of plies of cord, referred to as the tire's carcass=
. The internal construction is largely responsible for the strength and dur=
ability of a tire. It is an optional letter in the tire code, and if it is =
omitted, it is assumed that the tire is a cross-ply tire.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>R</b> stands for radial. Almost all passenger cars use tires with r=
adial internal construction. In a radial internal construction, the cords r=
un along the circumference of the tire, perpendicular to the direction of t=
ravel (or axis of rotation).</li>
	<li><b>D</b> stands for diagonal. In this type of tire construction, the c=
ords run along the circumference of the tire at a 30-40=C2=B0 angle from be=
ad (the part of the tire that contacts the rim of the wheel) to bead, and t=
he layers crisscross over each other.</li>
	<li><b>B</b> indicates a bias-belted tire. This type of tire is similar in=
 construction to diagonal tires except that a bias-belted tire has an addit=
ional layer above the topmost layer of ply. This additional layer is compri=
sed of stabilizer belts, typically made of steel or other corded material a=
pplied at different angles relative to the topmost layer of ply. This offer=
s additional support and makes the tire stiffer.</li>
	<li>Cross-ply tires are tires whose internal construction is made of nylon=
 cord placed diagonally across each other, usually at an angle of 55=C2=B0.=
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Diameter of the wheel:</b> The next part of the code is a 1- or 2-dig=
it number that indicates the diameter of the wheel, in units of inches, tha=
t the tire is designed to fit. There are many different tire sizes, and the=
 same wheel (rim) can be used with different tire sizes, as long as the mid=
dle of the tire is the correct size for the rim.</p>
<p><b>Load index:</b> The next part of the code is a 2- or 3-digit number r=
eferred to as the load index of the tire. The load index indicates the maxi=
mum weight that a tire can carry at a given inflation level. For example, a=
 load index of 95 means that a tire can carry 1,520 lb (690 kg) at a tire p=
ressure of 42 psi.</p>
<p><b>Speed rating:</b> The last part of the code is a 1- or 2-digit/letter=
 that indicates the speed rating of the tire. The speed rating of a tire is=
 the maximum speed at which a tire can carry a load that corresponds to its=
 load index. For example, a tire with a load index of 95 and speed rating o=
f H can carry 1,520 lb (690 kg) at a tire pressure of 42 psi and a speed of=
 130 mph (210 km/h).</p>
<p>Note that tires have many additional marks or codes, such as the DOT cod=
e.</p>
<p><b>DOT code:</b> the DOT code is a required code in the United States th=
at specifies the company, factory, batch, mold, and date of production of t=
he tire. The date of production of a tire is particularly important, and is=
 specified with 2 digits for the week of the year, and 2 digits for the yea=
r. For example, the code "1324" in the figure above means that the tire was=
 produced on the 13<sup>th</sup> week of the year 2024. When purchasing new=
 tires, it may be important to note the date of production. Due to the agin=
g of the rubber and other building materials, tires that were produced more=
 than 10 years prior should not be used regardless of their conditions. Som=
e manufacturers recommend replacing tires every six years regardless of the=
 number of miles driven.</p>

<h3>How is tire size calculated?</h3>
<p>The dimensions computed by our calculator use the following equations:</=
p>
<p style=3D"text-align:center;">Section Height =3D Aspect Ratio =C3=97 Tire=
 Width</p>
<p style=3D"text-align:center;">Tire Diameter =3D Wheel Diameter + 2 =C3=97=
 Section Height</p>
<p>The aspect ratio and tire width are measurements acquired from the tire =
code. The tire width is the 3-digit number preceding the forward slash ( / =
) in the tire code in units of millimeters. The aspect ratio is the 2- or 3=
-digit number immediately following the forward slash. Their product is the=
 section height.</p>
<p>Once the section height is computed, the tire diameter can be calculated=
 using the section height and the wheel diameter. The wheel diameter is ano=
ther measurement that is given by the tire code. It is the 1- or 2-digit nu=
mber after the letter that indicates the internal construction of the tire.=
 In some cases, the internal construction is not noted, and the wheel diame=
ter immediately follows the aspect ratio in the tire code. Wheel diameter i=
s specified in units of inches. The tire diameter is the sum of the wheel d=
iameter and twice the section height.</p>

<h3>What to consider when changing tire/wheel size?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons that a person may change their tire/wheel size. O=
ften, it is done for aesthetic reasons. When changing the size of a tire or=
 wheel, it is important to take certain things into consideration. Otherwis=
e, there can be significant consequences, such as increased wear and tear t=
o the vehicle's suspension and brake components (particularly anti-lock bra=
kes), which can affect handling or cause other mechanical issues affecting =
the transmission of the car.</p>
<p>There are many different sizes of tires, and different sized tires can b=
e used on the same rim, as long as the middle of the tire is the correct si=
ze. A common change is to increase the size of the rims. One of the key con=
siderations when increasing the size of the rims of a car is the change to =
the tire size. Generally, larger rims must be used with thinner tires becau=
se the tires must be small enough to fit inside the wheel well of the car. =
Generally, it is recommended to go with tires that have a diameter within 3=
% difference from the factory recommended tires.</p>
<p>On top of replacing tires for aesthetic reasons, people also change thei=
r tires as a result of blowouts or wear and tear. When replacing tires, it =
is ideal to change all of the tires at the same time. If this is not possib=
le, at least the front two or back two tires should be changed together, de=
pending on whether the tire that must be replaced is in the front or back. =
If only one or some of the tires are being changed, it is highly recommende=
d that the tire(s) be of the same type and brand. Differences in tires can =
cause a number of issues including loss of control or spinouts when driving=
, inaccurate speedometer readings, or even damage to the vehicle's stabilit=
y system calibrations.</p>
<p>Changing tires also affects the speedometers and odometers of a car, sin=
ce they are calibrated based on stock tires. Thus, while it is possible to =
safely use different-sized rims and tires on a car, it will still result in=
 changes to the car. Larger rims and tires increase the total circumference=
 of the wheel, which in turn increases the distance around the tire. This r=
esults in inaccurate speedometer and odometer readings because both are bas=
ed on how many revolutions the tire makes. Specifically, a larger tire will=
 result in a speedometer reading that is lower than the actual speed that t=
he car is traveling; similarly, it will result in an odometer reading that =
is lower than the actual distance traveled. Conversely, a smaller tire will=
 result in a speedometer reading that is higher than the actual speed the c=
ar is traveling, and an odometer reading that is higher than the distance t=
raveled.</p>
