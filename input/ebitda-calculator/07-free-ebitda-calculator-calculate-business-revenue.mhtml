<p>If you run a business, you've obviously heard of =E2=80=9CEarnings Befor=
e Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization=E2=80=9D, better known as=
 EBITDA.</p>
<p>EBITDA is considered a reliable measure of a company's financial perform=
ance. This income metric is most useful for investors; however, entrepreneu=
rs can use it too.</p>
<p>But how does EBITDA work - and, more importantly, what advantages does i=
t pose for your creative small business? Keep reading to uncover the basics=
 of EBITDA to gauge how profitable your small business really is.</p>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=

trong></a></h2>
<p>EBITDA (pronounced EE-BIT-DAH), or earnings before interest, taxes, <a h=
ref=3D"https://fincent.com/irs-tax-forms/form-4562">depreciation and amorti=
zation</a>, is a calculation of an organization=E2=80=99s bottom line and o=
verall performance. It is used as an alternative to the net income, but onl=
y in some circumstances.</p>
<p>EBITDA acts as a proxy parameter for <a href=3D"https://fincent.com/glos=
sary/cash-flow">cash flow</a> and lets banks and investors assess how much =
debt your company can take on its balance sheet.</p>
<p>As a result, this metric gives your investors an indication of your comp=
any=E2=80=99s ability to not only generate cash but also service its debt. =
These are two important considerations from an investment perspective.</p>
<p>While businesses are not legally required to reveal their EBITDA, accord=
ing to the <a href=3D"https://fincent.com/glossary/generally-accepted-accou=
nting-principles">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</a>, it c=
an be calculated and reported using the data in the company's financial sta=
tements.</p>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#the-components-of-ebitda"><strong>The Comp=
onents of EBITDA</strong></a></h2>
<p>To make the right use of EBITDA, you need to understand what each compon=
ent of the formula means.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earnings or Net Income:</strong> It is simply what your company=
 earns over a certain period of time, minus the <a href=3D"https://fincent.=
com/glossary/operating-expense">operating expenses</a>. You can think of th=
e net income as the profit your business made.</li>
<li><strong>Interest:</strong> An interest expense refers to the cost of se=
rvicing debt. It can also represent interest earned, although generally in =
EBITDA, this component is an expense.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes:</strong> The <a href=3D"https://fincent.com/blog/tax-lev=
ies">tax levied</a> by the IRS.</li>
<li><strong>Amortization:</strong> This is a method of spreading the cost o=
f an <a href=3D"https://fincent.com/glossary/intangible-assets">intangible =
asset</a> (such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights) over time, usually =
the course of its useful life. The goal of amortizing an asset is to match =
the expense of acquiring it with the revenue it generates.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Just like amortization, <a href=3D"https=
://fincent.com/blog/what-is-depreciation-types-formula-calculation-methods"=
>depreciation</a> is also a method of spreading the cost of an asset over a=
 specified period of time. The only difference is that depreciation is used=
 for tangible assets such as manufacturing equipment, business vehicles, an=
d computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are familiar with the components, you can now start calculating=
 your EBITDA.</p>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#the-ebitda-formula"><strong>The EBITDA For=
mula</strong></a></h2>
<p>Here's the simple formula you can use to calculate EBITDA for your busin=
ess:</p>
<p><code>EBITDA =3D Revenue - Expenses (excluding interest, taxes, deprecia=
tion, and amortization)</code></p>
<p>Or, in other words,</p>
<p><code>EBITDA =3D Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortiza=
tion</code></p>
<p>Let's take the example of Aleena, a small business owner from Boston tha=
t runs a handmade jewelry store. Her contemporary designs took off this yea=
r, and after subtracting the expenses from her revenue, her net income is a=
t $1.2 million.</p>
<p>The other financial details of her business are as follows:</p>
<p>=E2=80=A2 Interest paid: $360,000</p>
<p>=E2=80=A2 Taxes paid: $112,500</p>
<p>=E2=80=A2 Depreciation: $80,300</p>
<p>=E2=80=A2 Amortization: $10,000</p>
<p>If Aleena uses the formula, the total EBITDA for her business would be c=
alculated as:</p>
<p>$1.2 million + $360,000 + $112,500 + $80,300 + $10,000 =3D $1,762,800</p=
>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#what-is-an-ebitda-margin"><strong>What Is =
an EBITDA Margin?</strong></a></h2>
<p>The EBITDA margin was developed as an accounting method to calculate a m=
ore pragmatic profit picture for your business. To determine your EBITDA ma=
rgin, you must first calculate the EBITDA and then divide that total by the=
 total revenue:</p>
<p>Here=E2=80=99s the EBITDA margin formula:</p>
<p><code>EBITDA margin =3D EBITDA =C3=B7 Total revenue</code></p>
<p>Let's look at an example to better understand the importance of the EBIT=
DA margin.</p>
<p>Kelsey owns a small digital marketing agency in Delaware. The total reve=
nue that her firm generated this year amounts to $7 million, while the EBIT=
DA comes up to $700,000. As per the formula:</p>
<p>$700,000 =C3=B7 $7,000,000 =3D 10%</p>
<p>So the total EBITDA margin for Kelsey's agency will be around 10%.</p>
<p>The EBITDA margin shows how many operating expenses are eating into your=
 company's gross profit.</p>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#use-of-ebitda-across-industries"><strong>U=
se of EBITDA Across Industries</strong></a></h2>
<p>EBITDA offers a clearer insight into a company's operations by ruling ou=
t the expenses that can obscure the company's actual performance. It can al=
so be used to analyze profitability among companies and industries, as it e=
liminates the effects of finances and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>EBITDA is a good measure of the core profit because it removes some of t=
he extraneous factors and enables a more direct comparison. However, it can=
 also be misused to make a company's earnings appear greater than they real=
ly are.</p>
<p>Companies tend to highlight their EBITDA performance the most when they =
do not have very impressive (or positive) net income. It's not always a sur=
e-shot sign of a malicious trick, but EBITDA can sometimes be used to distr=
act investors from the lack of actual profitability.</p>
<p>Amortization is often used to expense the cost of software development o=
r any kind of intellectual property. This is one of the main reasons why ea=
rly-stage tech companies use EBITDA when dealing with investors and analyst=
s.</p>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#benefits-of-ebitda"><strong>Benefits of EB=
ITDA</strong></a></h2>
<p>EBITDA is generally used to compare the value of two companies from the =
same sector to ensure a fair equivalence.</p>
<p>Moreover, EBITDA is commonly used by buyers and investors to compare bus=
iness valuations. Small business owners can also quote EBITDA to communicat=
e the value of their company if they choose to sell it.</p>
<p>In case you're trying to pay off any debt on your long-term assets, you =
can use EBITDA as a shortcut to estimate the available cash flow.</p>
<p>The best part about EBITDA is that it gets rid of unhelpful variables li=
ke company tax rates, depreciation, and amortization, which are unique from=
 company to company. This helps in creating a realistic picture of a compan=
y=E2=80=99s operating performance.</p>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#drawbacks-of-ebitda"><strong>Drawbacks of =
EBITDA</strong></a></h2>
<p>The main drawback of EBITDA is that it does not fall under the Generally=
 Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). And since EBITDA is a "non-GAAP" me=
asure, its calculation can vary from one company to another.</p>
<p>It's a major red flag when a business uses EBITDA prominently and hasn't=
 done so anytime in the past. This may be because the company has borrowed =
heavily or is experiencing incremental capital and business development cos=
ts. In those cases, EBITDA can serve as a distraction for investors.</p>
<p>Other drawbacks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you spent money on an asset to use it for your business, EBITDA won'=
t take that cost into account.</li>
<li>It also eliminates the cash required to fund working capital and replac=
e older equipment.</li>
<li>EBITDA can make a business look less expensive than it actually is on p=
aper.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-name=3D"blog-title" class=3D"scroll-m-24"><a href=3D"http://localh=
ost:8080/tools/ebitda-calculator#ebit-vs-ebitda"><strong>EBIT vs. EBITDA</s=
trong></a></h2>
<p>Both EBT and EBIT are variations of the EBITDA parameter and are quite s=
imilar.</p>
<p>EBT (earnings before tax) shows the operating profit generated before ta=
xes, while EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) excludes both taxes an=
d interest expenses.</p>
<p>To calculate EBIT, you need to look at the income statement of a busines=
s. Simply take the total revenue of your business and then remove all of th=
e operating expenses.</p>
<p>This includes employee salaries, cost of goods, marketing expenses, and =
rent, along with associated overhead, depreciation, and amortization.</p>
<p>Here's how you can calculate EBIT:</p>
<p>EBIT=3D Net Income + Interest Expense + Tax Expense</p>
<p>To calculate EBT, you take your net income and add the taxes back to est=
imate the profit.</p>
<p>Investors can use EBT to analyze a company's operating performance after=
 eliminating the variables outside of its control. In the United States, th=
is is the most useful yardstick for comparing companies with different stat=
