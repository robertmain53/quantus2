                The idea of achieving financial independence has always int=
rigued me, and a few years ago I stumbled upon a twist on the traditional F=
IRE movement that really caught my attention: Barista FIRE. This approach c=
ombines the best of both worlds - working part-time in a job you enjoy whil=
e still enjoying the benefits of early retirement.

                 Barista FIRE is a unique subset of the <a href=3D"https://=
www.moneyoptimist.com/calculators/fire-calculator">
                  FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement
                </a> that involves switching to an easy and low-stress job =
with lots of free time while waiting for full retirement.
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                It's all about having enough money saved up to "retire earl=
y", but still working a part-time job to cover additional expenses and poss=
ibly getting health insurance benefits. This way, you can fund the rest of =
your lifestyle and fully enjoy the journey toward financial independence wi=
thout feeling overwhelmed or restricted by an all-or-nothing approach. =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                The term "Barista" refers to the idea that you can work a j=
ob that you enjoy, such as being a barista at a coffee shop, to supplement =
your income while living off your investment returns. The goal of Barista F=
IRE is to achieve financial independence and retire early, but with the add=
ed flexibility of being able to work a part-time job that you enjoy.
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                I've found that BARISTA Fire offers more flexibility and ba=
lance compared to the strict savings and frugality required by <a href=3D"h=
ttps://www.moneyoptimist.com/calculators/lean-fire">
                  Lean FIRE

                  Fat FIRE
                </a>. It's a fascinating concept that might just be the per=
fect fit for you if you're looking to achieve financial freedom without giv=
ing up the joy of working in a field you're passionate about.  Or maybe you=
 want to dramatically reduce your hours, go freelance in order to maintain =
a standard of living that's aligned to your values.  Barista FIRE gives you=
 that flexibility on your path to financial independence.
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                To calculate your Barista FIRE number, you need to determin=
e how much supplemental income you need to cover your living expenses. You =
can do this by subtracting your yearly expenses from your estimated salary =
from a part-time job. Once you have your supplemental income needed, you ca=
n multiply it by 25 to get your Barista FIRE number.
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                Barista FIRE is not for everyone, but it can be a great opt=
ion for those who want to achieve financial independence and retire early, =
but also want the flexibility to work a job that they enjoy. By working a l=
ow-stress job that you enjoy, you can reduce your stress levels and enjoy y=
our life more while still working towards your financial goals.

ou're shelling out each month. This covers all the essentials, like eating =
out, paying rent or mortgage, and keeping the lights on. You also want to i=
nclude those extra splurges like entertainment and other fun stuff you enjo=
y. Oh, and don't forget about those sneaky non-monthly costs=E2=80=94things=

                This is the expected growth rate at which your investments =
are expected to grow. On average, the stock market has historically provide=
d an average growth rate of 8%, which has been adjusted for inflation. Whil=
e this rate is historically reliable, it is important to note that there ar=
e no guarantees and that the growth rate of return can vary depending on th=
e type of investments you make. Additionally, it is important to remember t=
hat this 8% rate of return is an average, and that there may be times when =
you can expect to see higher returns, or there may be times when you experi=
ence a lower rate of return.

                This is the percentage of your financial independence savin=

referred to a lot in the FIRE movement as the "safe withdrawal rate". It is=
 a critical component to consider when planning for retirement or financial=

                The 4% default rate is based on the well-referenced Trinity=
 Study , which examined the past 50 years and concluded that withdrawing 4%=
 from liquid assets for 30+ years would not lead to running out of money. T=
his assumes that assets are invested in the stock market and the stock mark=

                Barista Fire is an approach to financial freedom that has g=
ained traction within the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) moveme=
nt. Unlike the traditional FIRE approach, Barista Fire allows you to leave =
your full-time job and achieve a degree of financial independence without h=
aving to cover all of your living expenses solely through your investments.=
 The term "Barista" comes from the idea that you could work a part-time job=
, potentially at a coffee shop, to make up for the difference in living exp=
enses that your investments don't cover. Ultimately, it's about finding wor=
k that you enjoy to supplement your income and maintain your desired lifest=
yle.

                Unlike Traditional FIRE, where the goal is to save and inve=
st enough to cover 100% of your living expenses in early retirement, Barist=
a Fire aims for covering most of your living expenses with your investments=
, while the rest is covered by a part-time job, contract work or starting y=
our own business. This means that you don't need to accumulate as much weal=
th before transitioning to early retirement, and can enjoy the benefits of =
financial freedom sooner.

                Similar to Barista Fire, <a href=3D"https://www.moneyoptimi=
st.com/calculators/coast-fire-calculator">
                  Coast FIRE=20
                </a>is another flavor of FIRE within the early retirement c=
ommunity. While both Barista Fire and Coast FIRE allow for an early escape =
from full-time employment, they differ in how investments and income are ma=
naged during early retirement.
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                Coast FIRE is achieved when you have saved and invested eno=
ugh that, without further contributions, your investments will grow to cove=
r your living expenses by the time you reach your desired retirement age or=
 your early retirement age. In this case, you can reduce or pause your inve=
stment contributions and work just enough to cover your living expenses unt=
il you reach full financial independence.
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                In contrast, Barista Fire requires you to pull some of your=
 investments early before reaching traditional FIRE as you're relying on so=
me of that income to live.  You could say COAST FIRE is a more risk-averse =
approach to early retirement as you're not touching your nest egg at all be=
fore reaching traditional FIRE.  Whereas, in barista fire, you're required =
to pull some of those investments out in order to live. =20

               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                In summary, Barista Fire is a strategy that allows you to p=
artially achieve financial freedom by replacing part of your full-time inco=
me with enjoyable part-time work. It differs from Traditional FIRE and Coas=
t FIRE in terms of the balance between investments and income during early =
retirement. By understanding these different approaches, you can tailor you=
r path to financial freedom based on your goals, timelines, and risk tolera=
nce.
              </p><h2>Barista FIRE Example</h2><p class=3D"">
                Let's take a family of 4 who have annual spending of $60k. =
Let's assume both parents are 40 and dutifully saved in their retirement an=
d investment accounts for the past 20 years. Now they have a net worth of $=
600,000.=20
              </p><p class=3D"">
                Now one of them wants to quit their full time job while the=
 other continues to work.  So right now they are making 60k/yr income but i=
t'll be going down to $36k during BARISTA FIRE. So they need to subtract th=
at work from their yearly expenses:

              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><blockquote>
                            <p>$60,000 (yearly expenses) - $36,000 (part-ti=
me salary) =3D $24,000 (supplemental income needed)</p>
                            <p>

                          </blockquote><p class=3D"">
                Now, they need to calculate their Barista FIRE number using=
 the 4% rule, which suggests that they can withdraw 4% annually from invest=
ments without running out of money. To do this, you multiply your supplemen=
tal income needed by 25 (the inverse of 4%). In their case:
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><p class=3D"">
               =20
              </p><blockquote>
                            <p>$24,000 (supplemental income needed) x 25 =
=3D $600,000 (Barista FIRE number)</p>
                            <p>
                              <cite></cite>
                            </p>
                          </blockquote><p class=3D"">
                So, according to these calculations, they would need $600,0=
00 in investments to achieve Barista FIRE and cover their remaining expense=
s after accounting for their one income.  And luckily for them, they have $=
600k in their net worth so they have officially reached BARISTA FIRE!

                Keep in mind that these numbers are just an example and wil=
l vary based on individual circumstances, expected expenses, and part-time =
job income. It's essential to tailor the calculations to your own financial=
 goals, lifestyle, and risk.
