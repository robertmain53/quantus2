<h3>What is Loan Refinancing?</h3>
<p>Loan refinancing involves taking out a new loan, usually with more favor=
able terms, in order to pay off an old one. Terms and conditions of refinan=
cing vary widely. Refinancing is more commonly associated with home mortgag=
es, car loans, or student loans. In the case that old loans are tied to col=
lateral (assets that guarantee loans), they can be transferred to new loans=
. If the replacement of debt occurs under financial distress, it is called =
debt restructuring instead, which is a process to reduce and renegotiate de=
linquent debts to improve or restore liquidity. For more information about =
or to do calculations involving debt, please visit the <a href=3D"https://w=
ww.calculator.net/debt-consolidation-calculator.html">Debt Consolidation Ca=
lculator</a> or <a href=3D"https://www.calculator.net/debt-payoff-calculato=
r.html">Debt Payoff Calculator</a>.</p>

<h3>Reasons to Refinance</h3>
<p><b>Save Money</b>=E2=80=94If a borrower negotiated a loan during a perio=
d of high interest rates, and interest rates have since decreased, it may b=
e possible to refinance to a new loan with a lower interest rate. This save=
s money on interest costs for the borrower. It is also possible to refinanc=
e when a borrower's credit score improves, which may qualify them for more =
favorable rates. This can in turn improve credit score even further if borr=
owers use the money saved to pay off other outstanding debts.</p>
<p><b>Need Cash</b>=E2=80=94The balance of a loan will decrease during the =
payback process. When enough equity has accumulated, the borrower may cash =
out by refinancing the loan (mostly home mortgage loans) to a higher balanc=
e. However, refinancing normally requires the payment of certain fees. Unle=
ss accompanied with a lower interest rate, cash-out refinancing is normally=
 expensive.</p>
<p><b>Lower Payment Amount</b>=E2=80=94Borrowers struggling to meet the min=
imum monthly payments on a loan can refinance to a new loan with lower requ=
ired monthly payments, which can help ease the financial burden. However, m=
ost probably, this will increase the loan term and increase the total inter=
est to be paid.</p>
<p><b>Shorten the Loan</b>=E2=80=94Borrowers can potentially pay off their =
existing loans faster by refinancing to shorter loan terms. One of the most=
 common examples is refinancing a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage, w=
hich typically comes with a lower interest rate, though this will most like=
ly result in a higher monthly payment.</p>
<p><b>Consolidate Debt</b>=E2=80=94Managing one loan with a single payment =
date instead of multiple loans with multiple payment dates is much simpler.=
 This can be achieved by refinancing multiple loans into a single loan (esp=
ecially one that has a lower interest rate than all previous loans).</p>
<p><b>Switch from a Variable Rate to Fixed, or Vice Versa</b>=E2=80=94It is=
 possible to use loan refinances to make the switch from variable interest =
rates to fixed interest rates in order to lock in low rates for the remaini=
ng life of the loan, which offers protection from rising rate environments.=
</p>

<h3>Refinance Mortgages</h3>
<p>Refinancing a mortgage may come with different benefits such as getting =
a lower rate, switching from an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed m=
ortgage, consolidating combo mortgages or other debt, removing someone from=
 a loan (example being ex-spouse), and more, depending on the type of refin=
ancing. Several types are explained in detail below.</p>
<p><b>Cash-Out Refinance</b>=E2=80=94It is refinancing with a new loan amou=
nt higher than the remaining owed amount on existing mortgages. The differe=
nce goes to the borrower in cash. Generally, borrowers need at least 20% eq=
uity in their property to be eligible for cash-out refinances. As with most=
 loans, there will be fees associated with cash-out refinances, typically h=
undreds or thousands of dollars, which should be factored into the decision=
-making process. Essentially, cash-out refinancing involves turning the equ=
ity built in a home into additional money. Some borrowers use the money for=
 home improvements. Others may use it for situations such as medical emerge=
ncies or car repairs. It can also be used it to pay off credit cards or oth=
er high interest debts.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, borrowers can also contribute more money towards t=
he settlement of a mortgage in order to reduce any remaining principal; thi=
s is referred to as a cash-in refinance.</p>
<p><b>FHA Refinance</b>=E2=80=94While mortgages from the Federal Housing Ad=
ministration (FHA) have less stringent down payment requirements, unlike co=
nventional loans, mortgage insurance premium (MIP) (not to be confused with=
 the additional upfront MIP that's 1.75% of FHA loan value) payments are st=
ill required after 20% home equity is reached. This can be circumvented by =
refinancing from an FHA loan to a conventional loan after 20% equity value =
is reached, since conventional loans do not require MIP payments after this=
 point. In some cases, this will result in a less costly loan and a smaller=
 monthly payment. There is also an FHA Streamline Refinance in order to ref=
inance an existing FHA loan into a new FHA loan, which usually results in a=
 reduced rate. Note that a credit check is required, and the mortgage must =
be in good standing in order to use this option. For more information about=
 or to do calculations involving FHA loans, please visit the <a href=3D"htt=
ps://www.calculator.net/fha-loan-calculator.html">FHA Loan Calculator</a>.<=
/p>
<p><b>Rate and Term Refinance</b>=E2=80=94This method refinances the remain=
ing balance for a lower interest rate and/or a more manageable loan term. T=
his differs from a cash-out refinance. Rate and term refinances are common =
when interest rates drop.</p>
<p><b>ARM Refinance</b>=E2=80=94Refinancing an ARM (when it is about to go =
through an adjustment) to a conventional fixed rate mortgage during a perio=
d of low interest rates can result in a new, more favorable loan. While ARM=
s usually provide a lower interest rate initially, they may rise during the=
 latter stages of the loan due to changes in the corresponding financial in=
dex.</p>
<p><b>Mortgage Refinance Costs</b></p>
<p>When refinancing mortgages, there are a number of common fees that may a=
pply. There is an input in the calculator to consider these in the subseque=
nt calculations.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mortgage Application Fee</b>=E2=80=94Lenders may charge about 1% of=
 the loan amount to process mortgage applications, approved or not.</li>
	<li><b>Home Appraisal</b>=E2=80=94Lenders usually require the appraisal of=
 the house value in order to evaluate changes in value, and whether borrowe=
rs have enough equity for successful application. This typically costs a fe=
w hundred dollars.</li>
	<li><b>Loan Origination Fee or Mortgage Points</b>=E2=80=94Normally 0-2% o=
f the loan amount, used as compensation for putting loans in place.</li>
	<li><b>Documents Preparation Fee</b>=E2=80=94On average, a few hundred dol=
lars to pay for the preparation of important documents such as the Truth-in=
-Lending disclosure.</li>
	<li><b>Title Search</b>=E2=80=94In the amount of a few hundred dollars, th=
is fee is paid to a title company to research court records, prior deeds, a=
nd property databases to guarantee the title is free and clear of liens.</l=
i>
	<li><b>Recording Fee</b>=E2=80=94This is a charge for handling paperwork t=
hrough counties or cities, and is usually a few hundred dollars or less.</l=
i>
	<li><b>Flood Certification</b>=E2=80=94In certain geographical areas, floo=
d certification is necessary.</li>
	<li><b>Inspection Fee</b>=E2=80=94This is a fee to evaluate the conditions=
 or working order of the property (plumbing, electrical, pests, roofing, HV=
AC, and anything else that may apply). Usually a few hundred dollars.</li>
	<li><b>Survey Fee</b>=E2=80=94A survey of the property ensures proper boun=
dary lines to prevent encroachment by adjacent properties. An existing surv=
ey may be used. If a new survey needs to be obtained, expect to pay a few h=
undred dollars.</li>

<h3>Refinance Student Loans</h3>
<p>Before considering refinancing student loans, in the U.S., different rep=
ayment plans are available for those struggling to meet their payments; bor=
rowers can change their standard repayment plan (10 years) to a plan such a=
s one that is income-based (payment based on income), graduated (gradual in=
crease in repayment), or extended (longer term). Students who find that the=
y are unable to meet payments regularly may consider requesting deferment o=
r forbearance, which can postpone required payments for some time. In speci=
fic situations, federal student loan debt can be completely forgiven, such =
as through the Teacher Student Loan Forgiveness program. When federal stude=
nt loans are refinanced, they are no longer considered federal loans, but p=
rivate loans, losing all the benefits of a federal loan.</p>
<p>Below are several other cases where refinancing a student loan may not b=
e the best option:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Irregular income</li>
	<li>Student loan interest rates are already relatively low</li>
	<li>The credit score is lower than 650</li>
</ul>
<p>In the U.S., private student loans are generally not as flexible as fede=
ral loans, so refinancing the private student loan may result in a lower pa=
yment. Typically, private student loans, Grad PLUS loans, and Parent PLUS l=
oans are most likely to benefit from being refinanced, since they usually h=
ave higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Student loan consolidation is different from student loan refinancing; t=
he former is a special program offered by the Department of Education in th=
e U.S. that allows all federal student loans to be combined into a single l=
oan. Student loan refinancing is the process of taking out a new loan in or=
der to pay off or replace other student loans. For more information about o=
r to do calculations involving student loans, please visit the <a href=3D"h=
ttps://www.calculator.net/student-loan-calculator.html">Student Loan Calcul=
ator</a>.</p>

<h3>Refinance Car Loans</h3>
<p>It is possible to refinance a car loan in order to increase the length o=
f the loan, thus reducing the size of the monthly payments. Although this g=
ives borrowers a bigger window to pay off their car loans, it typically inc=
reases the cost of the loans because more interest will be paid.</p>
<p>When refinancing, beware of "upside-down" auto loans, which refer to loa=
ns that the amount owed is more than the book value of the vehicle. This ca=
n occur when refinancing to a longer loan, since the value of the car will =
decrease over the loan term, and the car may eventually be worth less than =
what is owed.</p>
<p>Some car loan agreements contain clauses for early termination, such as =
a prepayment penalty for paying off the loan early. It is important to acco=
unt for these costs when deciding whether or not to refinance a car loan.</=
p>
<p><b>Car Refinance Costs</b></p>
<p>There may be an administrative fee (sometimes called an application fee)=
 for terminating old car loans, as well as transfer of lien holder fees, an=
d state re-registration fees. These fees can vary depending on various fact=
ors.</p>

<h3>Refinance Credit Cards</h3>
<p>While credit card debt differs from the other loans mentioned in that it=
 is a revolving form of credit, it can also be refinanced. One of the easie=
st ways to do so is to open a new balance transfer credit card. A balance t=
ransfer is a process of transferring high-interest debt from one or more cr=
edit cards to another card with a lower interest rate. There are balance tr=
ansfer credit cards that allow a grace period (as an example, 12 months) of=
 0% interest on all balance transfers before they resume a usual interest r=
ate (other types of 0% interest rate credit cards apply the 0% rate only to=
 purchases, not balance transfers). Not everyone will qualify for 0% intro =
APR credit cards, but there are balance transfer credit cards without a 0% =
grace period that have lower interest rates, and people that cannot qualify=
 for the former can try to qualify for the latter. The maximum amount of de=
bt consolidated will depend on the new line of credit.</p>
<p>Credit card debt can also be consolidated into debt consolidation loans.=
 Borrowers with good credit scores have a high chance of finding one with a=
 low interest rate. For more information about or to do calculations involv=
ing a credit card, please visit the <a href=3D"https://www.calculator.net/c=
redit-card-calculator.html">Credit Card Calculator</a>. For more informatio=
n about or to do calculations that involve paying off multiple credit cards=
, please visit the <a href=3D"https://www.calculator.net/credit-card-payoff=
-calculator.html">Credit Cards Payoff Calculator</a>.</p>

<h3>Refinance Personal Loans</h3>
<p>Refinancing a personal loan can be beneficial if the new personal loan h=
as a lower interest rate or a different repayment period. This is an option=
 for borrowers if interest rates have declined, their credit has improved, =
they have higher income, or they didn't get the best rate on their initial =
personal loan. Similar to the refinancing of other types of loans, whether =
it is beneficial or not will depend on whether the interest savings exceeds=
 the charged fees for refinancing.</p>
<p>Technically, it is possible for a borrower to refinance a personal loan =
as many times as they can get approved for a new loan, though some lenders =
require that borrowers meet certain criteria in order to refinance a person=
al loan. One such criterion is requiring a borrower to pay down an original=
 personal loan to 95% or less of the original balance before they are allow=
ed to take out another personal loan. The application process to refinance =
a personal loan will take into account the borrower's credit history and sc=
ore, as well as their debt-to-income ratio. For more information about or t=
o do calculations involving personal loans, please visit the <a href=3D"htt=
