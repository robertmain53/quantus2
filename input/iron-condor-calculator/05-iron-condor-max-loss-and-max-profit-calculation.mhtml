            <div class=3D"inner"><h2 id=3D"max-loss-calculation">Iron Condo=
r Max Loss Calculation</h2>
<p>Maximum possible loss from an iron condor (or <a href=3D"https://www.mac=
roption.com/iron-butterfly-max-loss/" title=3D"Iron Butterfly Maximum Loss =
Calculation and Factors">iron butterfly</a>) position depends on only two t=
hings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial cash flow (net premium received)</li>
<li>Wing width (distances between the wing <a href=3D"https://www.macroptio=
n.com/strike-price/" title=3D"Option Strike Price Explained">strikes</a>)</=
li>
</ul>
<h3 id=3D"initial-cash-flow-max-loss">How Initial Cash Flow Affects Max Los=
s</h3>
<p>Initial cash flow =E2=80=93 net premium received when opening an iron co=
ndor position =E2=80=93 does quite unsurprisingly affect total profit or lo=
ss.</p>
<p>The more cash you receive when entering the trade, the smaller your tota=
l loss if the trade goes against you, other things being equal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can expect initial cash flow to be included in the max los=
s formula with a minus sign.</p>
<h3 id=3D"wing-width-max-loss">How Wing Width Affects Max Loss</h3>
<p>Wing width may be less obvious. It is the distance between the two call =
strikes or the distance between the two put strikes (both distances should =
be the same, unless you have a <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/broken=
-wing-iron-condor/" title=3D"Broken Wing Iron Condor">broken wing iron cond=
or</a>).</p>
<p>For example, the wing width of a 45/50/60/65 iron condor is $5 (distance=
 between the two call strikes is 65-60 and distance between the put strikes=
 is 50-45).</p>
<p>The wing width decides how much one of the short options (the <a href=3D=
"https://www.macroption.com/short-call-payoff/" title=3D"Short Call Payoff =
Diagram and Formula">short call</a> or the <a href=3D"https://www.macroptio=
n.com/short-put-payoff/" title=3D"Short Put Payoff Diagram and Formula">sho=
rt put</a>) can get <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/itm-options/" tit=
le=3D"In the Money (ITM) Options">in the money</a> before its loss starts t=
o be offset by the corresponding long option (the <a href=3D"https://www.ma=
croption.com/call-option-payoff/" title=3D"Call Option Payoff Diagram, Form=
ula and Logic">long call</a> or the <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/p=
ut-option-payoff/" title=3D"Put Option Payoff Diagram and Formula">long put=
</a>, respectively).</p>
<p>If <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/underlying-price/" title=3D"Und=
erlying Price and How It Affects Option Values">underlying price</a> ends u=
p above the short call strike, the call is in the money. Because you are sh=
ort, the further in the money it gets, the more you lose. But when underlyi=
ng price reaches the long call strike, further losses are exactly offset by=
 gains from exercising the long call. Therefore, the most you can lose at e=
xpiration is the difference between the two call strikes. Everywhere above =
the long call strike the total loss is constant.</p>
<p>It is similar on the put side. The most you can lose at expiration is wh=
en underlying price ends up at or below the long put strike. The loss equal=
s the difference between the two put strikes. It does not grow any further =
below the long put strike.</p>
<h3 id=3D"max-loss-formula">Iron Condor Max Loss Formula</h3>
<p>When we combine the maximum loss at expiration (distance between the win=
g strikes) with the initial cash flow (which is positive and reduces maximu=
m loss), we get the iron condor max loss formula:</p>
<p><strong>Iron condor max loss =3D wing width =E2=80=93 initial cash flow<=
/strong></p>
<p>Note: This formula calculates max loss with positive sign (as max amount=
 lost). If we want max loss as minimum (worst, most negative) P/L, it is in=
itial cash flow minus wing width.</p>
<h3 id=3D"broken-wing-max-loss-formula">Broken Wing Iron Condor Max Loss Fo=
rmula</h3>
<p>We can generalize the formula to also apply to broken wing iron condor, =
where the two wings have different widths. Because maximum loss occurs on t=
he wider wing side (bigger difference between the short and long strike), t=
he max loss formula is:</p>
<p>Broken wing iron condor max loss =3D the greater of the two wing widths =
=E2=80=93 initial cash flow</p>
<h2 id=3D"max-profit-calculation">Iron Condor Max Profit Calculation</h2>
<p>Maximum profit is very simple. The <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com=
/iron-condor-success-rate/" title=3D"Iron Condor Success Rate and How to Pr=
edict It">best case scenario with iron condor</a> is that underlying price =
stays between the short (inner) strikes, all options are <a href=3D"https:/=
/www.macroption.com/otm-options/" title=3D"Out of the Money (OTM) Options">=
out of the money</a>, and they just expire. There is zero gain or loss at e=
xpiration. Total profit from the iron condor trade equals initial cash flow=
 (net premium received when entering the position).</p>
<p><strong>Iron condor max profit =3D initial cash flow</strong></p>
<h2 id=3D"example">Example</h2>
<p>Let's say we opened an iron condor with strikes 45 (long put) /50 (short=
 put) /60 (short call) /65 (long call).</p>
<p>Initial cash flow (premium received for the short call and short put, mi=
nus premium paid for the long call and long put) is $2 per share.</p>
<p>This is also the most we can gain from the trade if underlying price sta=
ys between 50 and 60 at expiration. Maximum profit is $2.</p>
<p>What is the maximum loss?</p>
<p>Wing width (distance between the call strikes or between the put strikes=
 =E2=80=93 both the same), is 65-60 or 50-45, which is $5.</p>
<p>Maximum possible loss is wing width minus initial cash flow: 5 =E2=80=93=
 2 =3D $3 per share.</p>
<p>The <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/calculating-option-strategy-ri=
sk-reward-ratio/" title=3D"Calculating Option Strategy Risk-Reward Ratio">r=
isk-reward ratio</a> is 3:2, or 1.5:1 (or 0.67 when expressed as <a href=3D=
"https://www.macroption.com/options-risk-reward-ratio/#format" title=3D"Dif=
ferent R/R Formats">reward/risk</a>).</p>
<h2 id=3D"break-evens">How Iron Condor Max Loss and Max Profit Relate to Br=
eak-Evens</h2>
<p>The <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/calculating-option-strategy-br=
eak-even-points/" title=3D"Calculating Option Strategy Break-Even Points">b=
reak-even points</a> in our example are at $48 and $62. Between these two p=
rices we profit, outside we lose.</p>
<p>Notice how the distance of break-even points from the short strikes (62-=
60 and 50-48) equals initial cash-flow and their distance from the long str=
ikes (48-45 and 65-62) equals maximum loss.</p>
<p>Think why this relationship holds.</p>
<p>Hint: Imagine how the underlying price gradually increases from the shor=
t call strike at $60 (maximum profit $2) to the long call strike at $65 (ma=
ximum loss $3).</p>
<p>Because the relationship between underlying price and <a href=3D"https:/=
/www.macroption.com/iron-condor-payoff/" title=3D"Iron Condor Payoff, Break=
-Even Points and R/R">payoff at expiration</a> is linear (the <a href=3D"ht=
tps://www.macroption.com/drawing-option-payoff-diagrams-in-excel/" title=3D=
"Drawing Option Payoff Diagrams in Excel">payoff diagram</a> is always a st=
raight line), the <a href=3D"https://www.macroption.com/option-break-even-p=
rice/" title=3D"Option Break-Even Price">break-even price</a> (the point wh=
ere the straight P/L line crosses zero on the way from +2 to -3) must be 2 =
pieces from the start (from $60) and 3 pieces from the end (from $65). It m=
ust be at $62.</p>
<p>It works the same on the put side (only with the underlying price declin=
ing from $50 to $45).</p>
